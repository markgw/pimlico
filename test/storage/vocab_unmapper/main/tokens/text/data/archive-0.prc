OOV OOV OOV by the President <SPEAKER OOV NAME=" President " > OOV and gentlemen , on OOV , as you know , an OOV OOV OOV OOV once again , with OOV OOV .
This is an area which has already been OOV OOV on a number of OOV since the OOV of the OOV OOV .
The OOV , OOV , OOV for OOV in OOV OOV are already very high .
There are OOV people OOV , OOV OOV people OOV , the area is OOV OOV and OOV of OOV have been OOV OOV the country .
<P> The European Union has already OOV its OOV by OOV a OOV OOV to the area , OOV financial OOV from the Union and Member States has been , or is in the process of being , OOV and I am able to OOV you that some OOV in the European Parliament have OOV that this issue be OOV in the debate on OOV and OOV OOV of major importance on OOV .
However , I should like to OOV you that I have , of course , on behalf of the European Union , OOV our OOV OOV and OOV OOV to the President of OOV OOV in the OOV which has OOV his country .
I would ask you , as a OOV of respect for the OOV and for the OOV OOV of their OOV , to OOV a OOV ' s OOV .
<P> ( The House OOV and OOV a OOV ' s OOV ) <P> President .
OOV , on OOV OOV , a OOV that most of us OOV with OOV , OOV a OOV of OOV for the OOV of OOV , in the OOV , who OOV OOV of their young people on OOV OOV ' s OOV .
I should like , on behalf of the European Parliament , to OOV our OOV to the OOV and OOV of the OOV .
I should also like to wish the OOV people OOV in this OOV OOV a OOV OOV .
<P> I should not OOV that many OOV , where OOV OOV are also OOV , are all too often OOV by OOV and OOV , OOV to a OOV of OOV safety measures .
It is in the same OOV that I should like to OOV my OOV to the OOV of the OOV OOV of the OOV at a OOV in OOV , in OOV , and I would ask you to OOV a OOV ' s OOV in OOV of these OOV .
<P> ( The House OOV and OOV a OOV ' s OOV ) <P> President .
OOV and gentlemen , I had OOV , as OOV had , that we would be able to open our first OOV of the year without having to OOV further OOV of OOV OOV .
OOV , on OOV OOV , OOV OOV OOV , a OOV OOV in OOV , was OOV by OOV .
OOV had OOV his OOV as they were OOV an OOV .
OOV OOV OOV OOV OOV OOV his life but OOV also OOV many OOV .
This is why I would like to OOV OOV to OOV in particular and I would ask you again to OOV a OOV ' s OOV .
<P> ( The House OOV and OOV a OOV ' s OOV ) OOV OOV OOV back to committee <SPEAKER OOV NAME=" President " > OOV regard to the report by Mr OOV on public OOV to Parliament , Council and Commission OOV , for which the vote on the OOV OOV resolution was OOV on OOV OOV , the Committee on OOV ' OOV and Rights , OOV and OOV OOV has OOV me that it is not yet able to OOV the two OOV OOV OOV down in the OOV of OOV .
This is why it has OOV that it be OOV back to committee OOV to OOV OOV OOV ) of the OOV of OOV .
<P> I shall now give the OOV to Mr OOV , OOV of this committee , so that he can present the OOV on its behalf .
<SPEAKER OOV NAME=" OOV " > Madam President , the House OOV agreed on OOV OOV to a OOV from the committee which I have the OOV to OOV to OOV the OOV vote on Mr OOV 's OOV OOV resolution .
That OOV was OOV to OOV time for the other OOV to consider our amendments and for the Commission to OOV OOV proposals .
OOV our OOV OOV , we have had OOV with the other OOV , OOV as yet no agreement has been OOV .
OOV , we would ask the House for a OOV of the OOV of a OOV of two OOV in order to OOV the OOV and , we hope , present to you OOV amendments for OOV at our OOV on OOV OOV .
<P> ( Parliament OOV the OOV ) OOV OOV OOV <SPEAKER OOV NAME=" President " > The next OOV is the OOV OOV OOV as OOV up by the OOV of OOV at its meeting of OOV OOV OOV .
<P> OOV from OOV to OOV OOV in OOV President .
I have OOV no OOV for amendments to the OOV for OOV , OOV or OOV .
<SPEAKER OOV LANGUAGE="FR" NAME=" OOV > Madam President , I would like to point out to my OOV Members and to OOV , that , OOV I OOV the OOV which OOV you to go over the OOV and set such a full OOV for OOV , with regard to the political OOV OOV to be OOV between OOV OOV and OOV OOV , the Council and the Commission have OOV the same OOV time as all the Members of the European Parliament , OOV OOV . OOV OOV for the Council and the Commission and OOV OOV for the OOV .
I am OOV to have to point this out , as I know we have a very OOV OOV on OOV , but OOV us OOV to change this , as , after all , OOV debate should take OOV over the OOV .
<SPEAKER OOV NAME=" President " > OOV you , Mr OOV ' OOV .
I will , of course , take OOV of your OOV .
<SPEAKER OOV LANGUAGE="DE " NAME=" OOV " > Madam President , I would like to take up some points made by Mr OOV and also say something about OOV ' s OOV .
OOV only is OOV ' s OOV OOV OOV , but important reports - such as the OOV report on OOV OOV , as well as OOV - are being OOV without debate , which is OOV to my OOV .
This can be put down to the OOV decision to OOV OOV OOV , which I would like to take this opportunity to OOV .
<P> <SPEAKER OOV LANGUAGE="ES " OOV OOV " > Madam President , I have OOV the OOV in order to OOV about OOV ' s OOV debate on fisheries .
A major debate has been OOV for that OOV and the OOV of OOV has OOV to OOV a Commission OOV on the OOV OOV with OOV without a resolution .
As you know , this is a very OOV issue and I would ask you to OOV a few things , as the OOV of this issue may OOV OOV the OOV debate .
<P> I would ask you first of all to state at OOV OOV this was OOV , in other words , whether it was the Commission itself that made the OOV or one of the political OOV .
<P> OOV , in OOV with the debate ' s OOV , the OOV course of action would be for the OOV debate on the OOV reports to take place and then for the Commission ' s OOV to be made and a further debate on this to take place .
OOV it no OOV OOV possible for OOV to take place in this way , because the political OOV have already OOV Members ' OOV OOV , I would ask that , in this case , the Commission OOV should be the first OOV so that Members may OOV in the debate and so that the Commission OOV is not made in the OOV of the debate , which would OOV all Members from being in an OOV position to OOV to this OOV by the Commission .
<SPEAKER OOV LANGUAGE="ES " NAME=" OOV OOV > Madam President , I shall be OOV to OOV to Mr OOV OOV .
The OOV Group OOV this Commission OOV - I do not know if any of the other OOV made the same OOV .
We did so for a very OOV reason : in the last few OOV we have OOV Commissioner OOV OOV negotiations on OOV OOV ; Mr OOV - I do not know if he is still in OOV - has OOV a new proposal and OOV negotiations ; some OOV for OOV or OOV , including the OOV OOV , have also made OOV , and it OOV OOV that we should be able to debate this issue and that we should be at least as well OOV - we are not OOV for a resolution - as OOV OOV .
This really is the most appropriate time , when we are OOV the future of our fisheries policy on the basis of OOV reports , for the Commission to make this OOV .
This is the OOV that OOV the OOV Group to make this OOV .
<SPEAKER OOV NAME=" President " > OOV you , Mr OOV OOV .
<P> Mr OOV , Mr OOV OOV has given you your OOV .
The OOV was made by the Group of the OOV of the European OOV , but I can OOV you that it was OOV OOV by the OOV of OOV .
<SPEAKER OOV LANGUAGE="ES " OOV OOV " > Madam President , I OOV for OOV ; I have OOV no OOV of OOV about the OOV of a Commission OOV .
It clearly is appropriate .
I want to make it clear that we support it , and I believe that it was also OOV in the OOV of OOV of political OOV , but today I have a meeting with the Committee on OOV , an OOV meeting , and this issue will OOV be OOV with .
As OOV of that committee , I OOV to have all the information so that I could OOV it to the other committee OOV .
The OOV is therefore welcome .
In no way do we OOV it .
OOV from it .
OOV group has also OOV it .
So that the debate may be OOV in an OOV OOV , which is what most concerns me , because this issue could OOV the OOV important fisheries OOV which we have on the OOV , it would be OOV for this OOV to be made after that debate , and that would then give us time to continue OOV this issue , although it OOV that that will not be possible .
<P> The OOV services had OOV me that the order of OOV would be as OOV : OOV the OOV OOV of the reports , and then the Commissioner would be given the OOV to make the OOV OOV .
In that case , the OOV would not be able to OOV to the Commissioner during the OOV debate .
<P> What I therefore ask is that the Commission OOV be made first and that then the OOV should take the OOV , so that OOV might have the same right as OOV to OOV , and be able to OOV to , the OOV by the Commissioner .
<SPEAKER OOV LANGUAGE="ES " NAME=" OOV OOV OOV " > Madam President , I wish to OOV Mr OOV OOV that these are the terms of the OOV of OOV , but I see that the OOV services have already OOV this to OOV .
The OOV - at the OOV of most group OOV - was that the OOV OOV would OOV first , and then the OOV of the Commission would OOV .
This was what OOV in the OOV of OOV , at which I had the OOV of OOV you , Madam President .
Mr OOV s OOV is out of place .
<SPEAKER OOV NAME=" President " > OOV you , Mr OOV OOV OOV .
I think that OOV is OOV clear now .
<P> OOV to OOV President .
I have OOV two OOV for OOV , OOV the debate on the OOV and OOV OOV of major importance .
It has been OOV that the OOV on " OOV OOV between OOV and OOV " be OOV by a new OOV OOV " The OOV case " , which is a OOV from the OOV Group of the European United OOV OOV OOV .
<P> I have OOV a further OOV , from the Union for a Europe of OOV Group , that the same OOV be OOV by a new OOV OOV the " OOV in OOV " .
<SPEAKER OOV LANGUAGE="FR" NAME=" OOV " > Madam President , I would like to OOV very OOV why my group has OOV this OOV which , OOV to what is OOV OOV , in the OOV OOV in particular , as the OOV case .
This is an important issue that OOV OOV the OOV of responsibility of one group .
As it OOV , it concerns the policy of a OOV OOV OOV OOV which has OOV OOV financial results OOV by the OOV of the OOV OOV as excellent , and which , at the same time , OOV to OOV OOV OOV OOV and to OOV OOV OOV in various Member States of the European Union .
It OOV to me that we cannot , on the one hand , make full employment a priority for European Union action and work on OOV a European OOV OOV to OOV down new rights for OOV and , on the other hand , OOV OOV this OOV of OOV , which OOV the interests of OOV before OOV .
This is why I OOV an OOV debate on this matter .
<SPEAKER OOV LANGUAGE="ES " NAME=" OOV OOV > Madam President , my group will be OOV in favour of this proposal because , to take up Mr OOV ' s OOV , this is not just a OOV issue , but a European issue , both because of the OOV of the OOV Group and because of the OOV OOV of the measures OOV in various countries .
OOV , because the European OOV OOV has been OOV by the Treaty of OOV , we feel that this is an extremely OOV issue and one that also needs to be OOV by the Swedish Presidency .
<P> OOV in OOV the fact that my group has also OOV up the situation of other OOV OOV that OOV OOV Europe or even OOV in the OOV and OOV OOV OOV , we feel that this issue should be given OOV OOV in the Committee on OOV and OOV OOV .
OOV this could OOV another OOV , because the issue is serious enough to OOV a more OOV and OOV OOV .
<SPEAKER OOV LANGUAGE="DE " NAME=" OOV " > Madam President , we do not OOV that it is an important issue we are OOV here , but this is something that OOV up time and again .
In the OOV , we always agreed that we would deal with such issues as part of a more OOV debate .
It is therefore OOV to OOV the OOV OOV , particularly as the issue which is to be OOV OOV the OOV , is so important .
<P> I would also like to point out - although I was OOV to OOV in the OOV of OOV in OOV , OOV to our European OOV ' s OOV OOV , my OOV , OOV OOV , was there to OOV me - that the issue has already been OOV on in the OOV of OOV and so there is no need for it to be OOV once again .
We are against OOV the OOV OOV on this issue .
<SPEAKER OOV LANGUAGE="FR" NAME=" OOV " > Madam President , first of all , Mr OOV can be OOV for his OOV since he was OOV .
However , Mr OOV , I would like to OOV you that the OOV of OOV certainly did not vote for or against this OOV and it was OOV that I should OOV this OOV in Parliament , which I have done .
<P> OOV the proposal by Mr OOV OOV , I am in OOV agreement with the proposal to OOV the whole matter , OOV OOV .
OOV and OOV OOV , to the Committee on OOV and OOV OOV so that we can then OOV a more general debate on this .
I do not OOV wish that this be OOV as an OOV OOV , but I do think that we should take OOV of this OOV OOV which is OOV up OOV OOV OOV the general public in all our countries , and which , in OOV fact , concerns the European Union .
OOV , if all Members are in agreement , I would certainly wish to OOV this matter to the Committee on OOV and OOV OOV .
<SPEAKER OOV NAME=" President " > Mr OOV , should I OOV then that you wish to OOV the current proposal to OOV OOV OOV in the debate on OOV and OOV OOV of major importance with this point ?
OOV I OOV that there is OOV OOV on Mr OOV OOV ' s proposal ?
I can see that this is the case .
<P> OOV any Member of the Union for a Europe of OOV Group wish to present the OOV to OOV the OOV with " OOV in OOV " ?
<SPEAKER OOV LANGUAGE="FR" NAME=" OOV " > Madam President , you mentioned OOV the OOV that have been OOV , which are OOV to OOV .
OOV , the Union for a Europe of OOV Group OOV the House to be able to OOV an OOV debate on the situation in OOV .
<P> OOV OOV , we were all able to OOV the OOV OOV of the OOV OOV of recent OOV OOV out in OOV by OOV OOV who OOV OOV back the OOV of OOV .
We cannot , therefore , OOV why Parliament , which is always so particular on human rights issues , should OOV OOV following further OOV of OOV OOV .
OOV this debate would OOV us to OOV that all the measures that have been adopted in OOV OOV countries , OOV in particular , to OOV OOV against OOV OOV and their OOV have the OOV support of the Members of the European Parliament .
<P> We see it as our OOV to OOV the OOV people a OOV of our OOV and OOV and to OOV the OOV Government to OOV , with the support of the European Union , the policy in this area that is OOV by the OOV OOV of its citizens , who , like us , are not used to this OOV OOV that is OOV their country .
<SPEAKER OOV LANGUAGE="FR" NAME=" OOV " > I believe that OOV who has had the opportunity to OOV OOV during recent OOV or years can make a better OOV of what this OOV OOV of OOV means to the OOV people and , indeed , I believe that it would be to our OOV if we OOV with this issue in an OOV debate .
I therefore believe that this is a good OOV .
<SPEAKER OOV OOV " OOV OOV " > Madam President , the OOV problem is that so much is OOV on the world OOV .
OOV at the OOV OOV , we OOV why they are not given the OOV priority .
This is the case for OOV .
But then there is also the OOV OOV which OOV has OOV OOV on OOV since OOV OOV 2000 .
OOV is OOV with the situation OOV the OOV region , OOV that this is a OOV issue , and we can OOV OOV OOV to OOV up once again .
OOV OOV committee has OOV OOV to OOV this OOV , which was OOV last time .
So I think it is only OOV that we should OOV the OOV on this region , so as to OOV conflict at a OOV OOV as far as we can , and also to OOV it to the attention of the OOV authorities .
<SPEAKER OOV LANGUAGE="FR" NAME=" OOV " > Madam President , in order to OOV OOV OOV between these two issues , would it OOV be possible to OOV the situation in OOV in the OOV rights ' OOV , in which case , all the issues OOV could be OOV with .
<SPEAKER OOV NAME=" President " > I can see that this very OOV OOV has the general support of the House .
We shall therefore vote for this to be OOV to the OOV rights ' OOV .
<P> ( Parliament OOV its OOV ) OOV OOV to OOV ' s OOV , I have OOV a OOV from the Group of the European OOV and the Group of the European OOV ' s OOV to OOV an OOV OOV " OOV in OOV OOV " .
This is a proposal which , OOV , OOV for itself and I shall OOV put it to the vote .
<P> ( Parliament OOV the proposal ) <SPEAKER OOV NAME=" OOV " > Madam President , I would like to continue with the subject of the OOV OOV .
I would like to OOV your attention to the plan for OOV ' s OOV , which has the debate on reports OOV after OOV OOV OOV OOV OOV . OOV , the report to be OOV at that time concerns the OOV of OOV OOV , which I OOV for the Committee on OOV , OOV OOV , OOV and OOV .
OOV that , at OOV OOV , there is the vote on this report , which OOV the OOV of OOV million OOV in Europe and OOV in this industry and other OOV OOV .
<P> In my opinion , if we have to debate a report like this one , which OOV the OOV of OOV million people , at OOV OOV , then the plan for OOV ' s OOV has OOV up against very OOV problems as a result of the OOV OOV being OOV .
I know that a few OOV people at most will OOV to vote .
It is OOV for Parliament that we should OOV a position on a report on such a OOV issue with such a small group of Members .
For this reason I would OOV it if OOV ' s OOV OOV could be used just to vote on OOV OOV , and OOV OOV with OOV reports could be OOV to the OOV for the next OOV OOV .
<SPEAKER OOV NAME=" President " > OOV you , Mr OOV .
I shall certainly take OOV of your OOV .
We have OOV from OOV that OOV in the OOV OOV vote was always very high and was enough to OOV the concerns that you have just OOV .
I OOV hope , of course , that we can continue to OOV the same OOV in future .
<P> OOV of OOV OOV and OOV OOV in OOV President .
I have OOV no OOV for amendments to the OOV for the OOV OOV of OOV OOV and OOV OOV .
<P> The OOV is OOV adopted .
<P> <SPEAKER OOV NAME=" OOV " > Madam President , on a point of order .
I OOV your attention to the fact that OOV OOV have been taking place in OOV in the OOV OOV OOV , OOV OOV at the OOV OOV and the OOV of the OOV .
OOV OOV the OOV OOV of OOV and its OOV has a number of OOV OOV and OOV OOV .
Mr OOV OOV , the OOV OOV of OOV , was OOV OOV and OOV to OOV OOV of OOV , following which Mr OOV OOV , the financial OOV of OOV OOV , was OOV at the OOV of his OOV , the OOV having been OOV in by the security OOV .
A number of other OOV OOV of OOV OOV are being OOV and OOV as we OOV here now .
<P> This is an OOV development and it OOV OOV the OOV question of Mr OOV , which I have OOV before and , as is well OOV , I am an OOV to OOV .
<P> Madam President , could we take this matter into OOV ?
You OOV the OOV OOV of OOV in OOV , Mr OOV .
You OOV to OOV about this problem of government OOV on OOV of the OOV and you OOV that something should be done .
OOV we OOV to find some way of OOV our OOV to the OOV Government and OOV out this question of OOV of the OOV and OOV which OOV relations between the OOV OOV and the European Union ?
<P> <SPEAKER OOV LANGUAGE="FR" NAME=" OOV " > Madam President , if I OOV OOV , following the resolution on OOV which we adopted in OOV , President OOV OOV was OOV to have OOV you , shall we say , a OOV of OOV .
If this is OOV , would you OOV the OOV of that OOV with us ? <SPEAKER OOV NAME=" President " > I have not OOV any such OOV .
If I had , I would OOV have OOV the House .
<SPEAKER OOV OOV " NAME=" OOV > Madam President , in recent OOV , even as we OOV , reports have been OOV in of the OOV number of OOV of young OOV and many OOV who have OOV OOV to extremely serious OOV OOV to OOV OOV OOV by the use of OOV with depleted uranium OOV .
OOV , Madam President , I am OOV we would all wish to OOV our OOV OOV to the OOV of the young OOV , the European OOV and the citizens of the OOV OOV of OOV on the OOV of their OOV OOV following OOV OOV from OOV OOV .
<P> OOV , I must OOV you that I OOV welcome your OOV on the depleted uranium issue .
In particular , I support your call for an OOV OOV on the use of these OOV OOV .
I am quite aware that some people OOV that there is any OOV between the OOV and OOV health and the use of the OOV , but I also know that no military OOV is able to OOV the OOV .
OOV , if it is not possible to OOV an OOV OOV , it is OOV to OOV an OOV OOV , for although these OOV are not OOV in use in OOV they continue to be used in OOV .
I OOV that you will OOV this matter .
<SPEAKER OOV OOV " NAME=" OOV OOV " > Madam President , at OOV OOV this OOV , I OOV OOV in the good OOV of OOV other OOV , OOV and one Commissioner at OOV OOV .
We were really OOV forward to OOV another OOV in OOV after the OOV , but our OOV was OOV , OOV .
This is not the first time .
We OOV to OOV with OOV OOV .
OOV this OOV OOV was taken over by OOV OOV this year , one in two OOV has been OOV .
That means that each time we OOV to make our way to OOV , in good OOV , we OOV OOV yet another OOV .
OOV too , we had to OOV OOV OOV to OOV .
So , although I was at OOV in OOV at OOV OOV , I , OOV with OOV OOV , did not OOV in OOV OOV OOV OOV
At present , OOV OOV is still OOV % OOV , and the OOV Government has OOV us that it will OOV over OOV to make our OOV OOV more OOV .
That is why I would ask you to OOV this OOV on to the OOV Government , because we would OOV like to OOV our OOV OOV to and from OOV every OOV and every OOV on time .
<P> <SPEAKER OOV NAME=" President " > Mrs OOV OOV , I am extremely concerned by what you have OOV me and I can OOV you that I shall most certainly OOV your OOV OOV to the appropriate parties .
<SPEAKER OOV NAME=" OOV " > Madam President , on a point of order .
I wish to OOV the attention of the House to an OOV OOV which has OOV since our last OOV , and that is the case of Mr OOV OOV .
OOV of you may be OOV that part of OOV is already part of the European Union because OOV OOV OOV OOV OOV on OOV and Mr OOV was OOV from one of those OOV OOV before OOV .
That OOV was an OOV OOV .
Mr OOV is now being OOV in OOV OOV .
<P> I would OOV to the House to OOV its OOV with Mr OOV and his OOV .
OOV has been OOV of a OOV of which I do not think he is OOV .
However , OOV the OOV of his case , the OOV of his OOV were OOV .
OOV was OOV from the OOV of a European Union Member State .
I would ask the President to OOV our concern to the OOV Government about this OOV and our hope that this OOV OOV will not OOV the OOV to the OOV problem and the peace negotiations which are OOV at this OOV , and to OOV our hope that Mr OOV will be OOV as OOV as possible .
<SPEAKER OOV OOV NAME=" OOV " > Madam President , may I start by OOV that I agree OOV with what Mr OOV just said , although that is not why I OOV for the OOV .
I OOV for the OOV on the matter OOV by Mrs OOV , in order to OOV yet another OOV of OOV on the part of the OOV OOV OOV in OOV OOV .
OOV OOV Member has OOV the OOV and I need OOV no further OOV .
I would just point out that not only was Mr OOV OOV on OOV OOV to the OOV OOV , he was OOV and is being OOV by the military of a country which is a OOV for OOV of the European Union .
OOV , every OOV for taking action against OOV is open to us and I call on you , Madam President , and all my OOV Members of the European Parliament to OOV OOV and OOV the OOV OOV of Mr OOV , who is OOV and OOV .
In fact , the whole OOV OOV to be a set up , the OOV OOV of which is to OOV Mr OOV for a OOV OOV OOV OOV by the OOV of OOV OOV OOV .
<SPEAKER OOV NAME=" President " > Mr OOV , we shall see what we can do about this .
I OOV OOV to both your OOV and that made by the Member before you .
OOV regard to Mr OOV ' s OOV , he is aware that I made a OOV which fully OOV his own OOV .
<SPEAKER OOV OOV NAME=" OOV " > Madam President , I too wish to OOV to the OOV OOV by Mrs OOV and Mr OOV at the OOV OOV of a OOV OOV .
OOV only is this OOV OOV , but a OOV of OOV was OOV next to OOV so that he could be OOV of OOV OOV , even OOV the OOV was OOV out on a OOV OOV to OOV - a OOV OOV and a OOV of the European Union .
<P> We need to OOV OOV because I am OOV that , now that OOV has been OOV as a OOV country of the European Union , it OOV it can OOV with OOV in these OOV .
It has already OOV to OOV at two points on the OOV with the OOV OOV in OOV , in OOV of OOV OOV , and the OOV OOV from the OOV and from us and from the OOV of OOV are so OOV that it OOV no attention to them OOV .
OOV , Mr OOV , the OOV of " OOV OOV " which , I would OOV the House , is under OOV OOV , has OOV to take part in further OOV on the OOV problem because he OOV he is in a much OOV position than before , now that the European Union - without , I believe , a great deal of OOV - has OOV OOV 's OOV for OOV of the European Union .
<SPEAKER OOV LANGUAGE="DE " NAME=" OOV " > Madam President , I would like to OOV your attention to the fact that the Council - not for the first time , I might OOV - has OOV the OOV of OOV .
The point being that we OOV have the opportunity , once a OOV , to OOV a OOV question , for priority OOV which , OOV to the OOV of OOV , must be OOV to within three OOV .
OOV what we are OOV is that OOV often , the Council is OOV to OOV to this time OOV .
OOV is the OOV example : I OOV a question in OOV , to which I have not OOV an OOV to this OOV , OOV when is the Council going to get OOV to OOV the OOV increase OOV to the OOV OOV ?
This is not an OOV case , rather such OOV are OOV up .
I would OOV you to OOV the Council to OOV the OOV of OOV .
<P> <SPEAKER OOV OOV OOV " > Madam President , I take the OOV in order to point out yet again - having OOV to you OOV on the matter - that for OOV now , since OOV OOV in fact , OOV of political OOV OOV in OOV conditions in OOV have been on OOV OOV , which they OOV to see through to the OOV end - some have in fact already OOV - in a OOV to OOV the OOV Government from going OOV with its plan to OOV them up in OOV OOV in order to OOV their OOV and their OOV .
<P> We all know what a OOV OOV it was for the whole of OOV when the OOV military and OOV OOV OOV OOV the OOV .
They OOV people .
They OOV on OOV .
They OOV OOV the OOV of political OOV OOV OOV the OOV and OOV on OOV OOV .
<P> I think that it is OOV that OOV we OOV the OOV have as yet OOV against this situation in OOV , more OOV terms ; our OOV OOV the whole of OOV feel that both the European Parliament and the European Union are OOV to this OOV .
So I ask , even now , that you OOV your OOV and make our OOV OOV .
<SPEAKER OOV NAME=" OOV OOV > Madam President , with the OOV OOV we have OOV through the OOV OOV OOV OOV OOV that OOV OOV and three OOV OOV who had already been OOV as OOV had been OOV by the OOV Government .
<P> OOV OOV of OOV are OOV by the OOV OOV .
On the OOV , many OOV are OOV because of such OOV .
OOV the European Union that is OOV not OOV .
<P> It is OOV upon us to OOV the OOV Government on this issue .
I would OOV this Parliament to issue a OOV in the OOV possible terms to OOV our OOV OOV to OOV .
<P> I am OOV that you will want to OOV fully and OOV to this concern .
<SPEAKER OOV NAME=" OOV " > Madam President , has it been OOV to your attention that the Members ' OOV of interests was last OOV OOV on an OOV OOV , OOV ?
This was not the result of Parliament OOV into OOV the OOV of OOV and OOV , but OOV the OOV of the OOV by a OOV in Parliament working for a OOV OOV OOV .
<P> OOV that the OOV have been put into the public OOV , will you OOV all concerned not to OOV Parliament to continue OOV OOV and OOV , but to take OOV action to OOV us into the OOV OOV and get the information OOV on our own OOV and made OOV available to European citizens ?
<SPEAKER OOV NAME=" OOV " > Madam President , I also OOV that a OOV OOV programme OOV to make OOV of Parliament and would point out that my own group has , of course , already OOV its OOV of interests on the OOV .
It OOV open to Mr OOV ' group to OOV OOV and OOV our OOV in OOV the OOV of interests on the OOV .
<P> In the OOV , I agree with OOV .
I think the OOV this is on the OOV , the better .
It is a matter of public OOV .
There is no reason why it should be OOV OOV .
That is the point I believe the OOV will be OOV on the OOV in the OOV future .
OOV OOV OOV OOV <SPEAKER OOV NAME=" President " > The next OOV is the OOV for second OOV ( OOV ) , by Mrs OOV , on behalf of the Committee on OOV and OOV OOV , on the Council common position for OOV a European Parliament and Council directive on the OOV and OOV up of OOV OOV .
<SPEAKER OOV OOV " NAME=" OOV " > Madam President , the European Commission OOV a proposal for a directive on the OOV of OOV , OOV and OOV OOV OOV to the OOV and the OOV of OOV OOV back in OOV .
That so much time has OOV , is OOV down to the OOV issue .
<P> The OOV of the directive is to ensure that a OOV OOV and its OOV in other Member States are OOV or OOV up OOV to the OOV of OOV and OOV .
This means that the OOV authorities of the OOV Member State have OOV OOV in OOV out the OOV or OOV up of a OOV OOV and its OOV OOV the OOV
This OOV to all OOV , OOV where OOV OOV of this directive OOV OOV .
The OOV of the directive is , OOV , not to OOV but to ensure OOV OOV of all OOV and a OOV approach OOV the whole of Europe .
<P> As rapporteur , I can OOV OOV with the OOV of this report .
In OOV with the Council and Commission , I have OOV to make a few OOV to this report in the OOV of two OOV of OOV .
The first OOV is OOV to the fact that the OOV of the Council ' s common position was not OOV with the OOV OOV directive and the directive on the OOV up and OOV of OOV OOV , which is to be OOV on next OOV within the OOV Commission .
This OOV of OOV in OOV which OOV the same subject matter is OOV , OOV there is a good reason for it .
<P> As rapporteur , I have taken great OOV in OOV legislation on this particularly important subject matter as clearly and OOV as possible .
OOV our amendments OOV to OOV OOV , which OOV with the OOV to the OOV .
OOV amendments OOV the directive into OOV with other OOV , such as the OOV directive and the OOV up of OOV OOV , as I mentioned a OOV OOV .
These are OOV OOV OOV OOV OOV ) and OOV OOV ) .
OOV means of OOV OOV to OOV , they are OOV in the report , but this time by OOV the same OOV as in the other two OOV .
<P> The second OOV of OOV OOV to the OOV of a number of OOV to the main OOV .
These OOV had been OOV in an OOV OOV and were open to OOV .
OOV , there was the OOV , in the OOV on the OOV OOV , that the OOV was more OOV than the main OOV .
OOV this , the OOV on OOV OOV , OOV OOV , OOV OOV and OOV OOV were OOV as such in the common position .
<P> In the first OOV , I OOV to see these OOV OOV .
The only problem was that certain parties within the Council could not OOV with OOV OOV these OOV .
For this reason , I have OOV to OOV agreement with the Council , and this was done at the OOV OOV last OOV .
The OOV still OOV the OOV of the three OOV , but three other OOV will be OOV OOV .
OOV OOV , the OOV OOV do not OOV legislation of the Member State to which the OOV OOV .
These OOV also OOV that the OOV rules of the OOV Member State of the OOV OOV in question are not OOV .
That means , therefore , that if OOV are OOV with OOV OOV , the OOV from those OOV are still OOV in the OOV .
That is what this is about , and that was the reason OOV my OOV proposal to OOV .
<P> OOV is now OOV out OOV and clear , OOV is OOV and I am OOV that , by OOV OOV , we have OOV OOV a OOV OOV OOV .
<P> We are OOV OOV two OOV of OOV .
OOV OOV is OOV OOV with respect to other OOV , the other OOV a number of OOV .
I hope from the OOV of my OOV that this legislation , which I believe Parliament has OOV in terms of quality , will OOV have to take OOV .
<SPEAKER OOV NAME=" OOV " > Mr President , the main points of OOV in this report concern three different OOV of OOV agreement , OOV OOV OOV , OOV OOV , and OOV OOV on a OOV market .
As Mrs OOV ' report OOV , these OOV of OOV were OOV in committee OOV this debate and , in OOV , what we are OOV to do with the OOV OOV by Mrs OOV is to ensure that parties can OOV their own OOV law in OOV to these particular OOV , but not their own OOV OOV law .
<P> There is a OOV here between the law of the OOV and the OOV OOV law , because it is quite important to ensure that parties , OOV they may OOV the law of OOV , may not actually OOV their own OOV law .
<P> OOV a problem OOV OOV the OOV between the law of OOV and OOV law .
What we are OOV to do is to ensure that the OOV OOV and OOV OOV are OOV at the other end are then OOV with OOV to the OOV law of the OOV State .
There is still one OOV OOV in the OOV about what OOV with OOV , for example , in OOV which have OOV OOV which OOV in before the OOV law actually OOV place .
In OOV , these are OOV as OOV OOV and OOV that in certain countries , such as OOV , I believe all OOV are OOV OOV by an OOV OOV .
I OOV Mrs OOV ' work in OOV what OOV OOV OOV and OOV up with a OOV that OOV OOV State OOV which is OOV in terms of the OOV market , but I have some OOV that there will still have to be some OOV .
<P> I hope that we will not have to have a third OOV , but we may have to just to make it OOV clear that these OOV OOV would not OOV OOV OOV , OOV OOV and OOV in a OOV market .
I would OOV to the House that in some OOV it is more important to get a clear OOV than to get one that OOV OOV ; one that is OOV OOV in every respect .
OOV with a clear OOV people can OOV their OOV OOV the framework that we have set up .
It is OOV to do that .
I OOV the work that Mrs OOV has done and I hope that we have OOV OOV this issue out .
I just have certain OOV about the OOV OOV and OOV that we might need some OOV at a OOV OOV .
<P> The other OOV issue OOV right in OOV and the OOV between the common position and the OOV up OOV that Mrs OOV has done , and this is something we have OOV at OOV .
In OOV , there is a OOV of common OOV between what the Council OOV in the common position and the OOV OOV that Mrs OOV has OOV .
I am OOV to think , in view of the OOV , that it may well be OOV OOV to the common position on that particular issue , because of the OOV OOV that it might OOV to the OOV OOV market .
This is not a OOV interest to me as a OOV OOV , because it does not OOV the OOV market in any way - it is much more important for the OOV , the OOV and the OOV OOV market .
<P> I would OOV Mrs OOV on OOV work .
It is a very good report .
There are still one or two small points of OOV in it , but OOV has done an excellent OOV .
I OOV for the OOV we have had in committee over the OOV and I am OOV that it has all been OOV now .
<SPEAKER OOV OOV " > Mr President , I do not feel that I will need the full OOV OOV , OOV this will OOV you to OOV up OOV OOV .
I would OOV like to OOV Mrs OOV as rapporteur on this report which , as Mrs OOV has already OOV , has been extremely OOV .
The issue has long been OOV , OOV because of the national OOV at OOV level , rather than the issues OOV OOV from Parliament , but OOV OOV in Parliament have been both OOV and OOV in terms of their approach and are very welcome .
<P> In an OOV to provide for OOV OOV OOV the EU , the OOV of OOV and OOV are the OOV OOV , of course , of this report , and OOV and OOV are therefore OOV .
<P> OOV the rights of OOV in Member States other than their own are OOV by the OOV of cooperation between the OOV authorities in the Member States , but OOV us be clear , in case some of you have not OOV the OOV , this is not about OOV , it is about OOV OOV of Member States ' OOV measures and OOV up OOV .
<P> Parliament 's OOV in OOV OOV OOV in the OOV proposal is important .
There are many in Parliament who feel the issues here are of real concern since they all concern the OOV of European citizens ' interests and rights ; indeed this report OOV OOV many of the OOV , such as the OOV OOV OOV .
But , of course , many of the OOV in the common position which OOV OOV back to us have to be OOV , as they OOV many of Parliament 's concerns , although some work has still to be done .
<P> It is therefore OOV for Parliament , OOV OOV the OOV OOV 's OOV , to OOV our OOV from the first OOV but to OOV and also OOV the OOV OOV from this OOV .
OOV OOV OOV and OOV OOV the OOV into OOV with the OOV OOV and the OOV OOV proposals which had already been agreed last OOV : this OOV Parliament 's OOV , therefore , to see a OOV of OOV in this matter .
I also see great OOV for OOV in OOV OOV OOV , OOV and OOV OOV OOV that other national OOV , especially in my group , may have other concerns in this area .
But I OOV OOV my support to the OOV of OOV this directive in OOV with the OOV OOV and the OOV OOV proposals .
<P> It OOV to me that , OOV , in the OOV amendments , following in the OOV of OOV up OOV for the OOV of OOV , Parliament 's rapporteur has OOV the OOV of quality we have come to OOV from OOV Members .
OOV issues such as OOV OOV to have been OOV in as an OOV OOV of amendments , what we have here is a OOV OOV OOV , OOV of OOV support in the House and OOV serious OOV within the Council .
<SPEAKER OOV LANGUAGE="DE " OOV " > Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , we are all agreed that the directive on the OOV of OOV OOV is long OOV , which is also why we welcome it .
A OOV OOV is at last to be OOV and there is to be OOV between the OOV OOV and the OOV OOV .
We would do well to OOV that the OOV on OOV OOV ' rights , in particular , are of OOV importance here , since they OOV the principle of OOV OOV with information , as well as the conditions OOV OOV made to them .
In this way , all OOV , including those in countries other than the OOV Member State , are OOV OOV OOV under the OOV up OOV , and a OOV approach .
<P> OOV the OOV in its current form is OOV excellent , some OOV is OOV .
OOV , for example , the OOV principle of OOV was OOV by a OOV of amendments in committee , and OOV areas of OOV with the OOV OOV to financial OOV , and which could OOV to legal OOV , were OOV out .
You will already have OOV in the course of the debate that we OOV on one point , OOV in OOV to OOV OOV OOV and OOV .
The OOV OOV between the OOV and OOV up of OOV OOV and OOV OOV is not OOV for all OOV .
OOV OOV on this because we believe what we are OOV about here are different OOV , and OOV different OOV , and that different OOV and different OOV should be OOV OOV , and not OOV the same .
<P> The common position is OOV to my OOV and was OOV on , to some OOV , by the committee ' s amendments and those OOV by the rapporteur , Mrs OOV , OOV I would like to thank .
The OOV OOV , therefore , to be adopted without OOV and OOV by the Member States .
I OOV that the OOV in the Council has OOV to this being OOV by more than a OOV .
I would point out that the Commission ' s first proposal was OOV as OOV as OOV and Parliament ' s first OOV was OOV back in OOV .
The reason I OOV this is because we OOV OOV the OOV between the European OOV in our OOV - particularly in the OOV of the OOV European Council - and in many OOV OOV how the OOV OOV to be OOV .
This does not just OOV to Parliament , which is often the OOV given in the public OOV , although we would , of course , do well to OOV and OOV quite a few OOV of our own too .
<P> But this is not about OOV OOV .
However , OOV the OOV and OOV process in the European Council OOV the best OOV for OOV the OOV between the European OOV .
That has been made OOV clear again here .
<P> The Commission proposal is OOV to ensure that a OOV OOV and its OOV OOV in other Member States can be OOV and OOV up OOV to the principle of OOV and OOV .
That is OOV under this OOV directive .
<SPEAKER OOV OOV " NAME=" OOV " > Mr President , the market and national authorities have been OOV forward to the directive on the OOV and the OOV of OOV OOV OOV into OOV for some time now .
This directive , in fact , OOV to provide a OOV with regard to the OOV which , in an OOV OOV and in a way which is OOV OOV to the sector , OOV the OOV , the OOV , the rights and OOV relations when a OOV , which is OOV in different EU Member States , OOV into OOV or OOV under .
This directive OOV the action plan for financial services .
<P> In its common position , OOV by OOV OOV , the Council OOV a OOV and OOV OOV into the specific OOV of the OOV sector which set it OOV from the OOV , both in terms of the OOV OOV in general and OOV to other financial OOV , such as the OOV OOV and the OOV and OOV industry .
This is why OOV OOV of the common position OOV the OOV sector OOV OOV on a number of OOV .
This OOV OOV does not in any way OOV the OOV and OOV of a set of rules for the financial services as a whole .
OOV the OOV , in fact ; it does OOV to the specific OOV of OOV , OOV OOV a better OOV for OOV and legal OOV .
<P> The report by Mrs OOV , on which I would like to OOV OOV on behalf of the Commission , and in respect of which I would like to OOV the OOV OOV by Mrs OOV and Mr OOV , which OOV the common position for the most part , OOV a number of amendments to OOV OOV , as was OOV OOV this OOV .
<P> The Commission can OOV the OOV of these amendments , OOV one .
It OOV , at least in principle , to OOV No OOV with regard to OOV OOV .
OOV all , it is of OOV importance that the OOV know in OOV what legislation will OOV OOV OOV .
<P> As it OOV , Mrs OOV , on behalf of the OOV Group , has OOV OOV new amendments .
These amendments OOV the amendments adopted by the OOV and OOV Commission together in a OOV OOV which does OOV to the OOV position of the OOV sector .
OOV a different OOV , the new amendments take into OOV the specific OOV which are OOV in the OOV sector with regard to OOV OOV , OOV OOV and OOV and OOV within OOV OOV .
The Commission can go OOV with the OOV of these amendments , as is OOV in its OOV OOV .
If the OOV new amendments are adopted by this Parliament , the Commission can OOV to the OOV of all amendments OOV in Mrs OOV ' report , including OOV No OOV .
However , the OOV of all amendments - and I am also making this point in OOV to OOV made by Mrs OOV - would then have to be OOV in order to OOV the OOV and OOV of these amendments with OOV OOV . <SPEAKER OOV NAME=" President " > The debate is OOV .
<P> The vote will be taken OOV at OOV OOV .
OOV OOV OOV legislation for the OOV market ( OOV ) <SPEAKER OOV NAME=" President " > The next OOV is the report by Mr OOV on behalf of the Committee on OOV OOV and the OOV OOV on the OOV from the Commission to the Council and to the European Parliament on the OOV of OOV legislation for the OOV OOV .
<SPEAKER OOV OOV " NAME=" OOV " > Mr President , OOV OOV within OOV industry OOV to OOV enough EUR OOV OOV OOV OOV .
This was OOV in the OOV last OOV by OOV , the OOV OOV Committee of OOV on the OOV of OOV OOV .
The OOV OOV OOV OOV OOV OOV on OOV OOV OOV and OOV .
The OOV , as far as this is concerned , is no OOV .
OOV has OOV that OOV OOV OOV within OOV account for OOV to OOV OOV OOV of the OOV of EU Member States .
This is a OOV OOV , which OOV small OOV particularly OOV .
<P> I know of OOV who have quite OOV OOV against further OOV of their OOV because they want to OOV having to take on OOV at all costs .
OOV are OOV by the OOV OOV OOV involved .
In this way , the many OOV OOV by OOV on OOV OOV the OOV of OOV and employment .
OOV of the time , it is not even the legislation which is OOV or OOV , but it is often the OOV of OOV which OOV the OOV OOV so OOV , and the European Parliament OOV to this in its own way .
<P> This OOV me of a report we OOV last year which OOV to the working conditions on OOV OOV .
OOV of the OOV in that report , OOV to an OOV in Parliament , OOV to OOV a OOV OOV OOV is OOV on it .
OOV OOV from the OOV of such OOV , one OOV who OOV OOV OOV with this OOV of legislation .
<P> OOV of the OOV problems in our OOV society is OOV the fact that we OOV far too many OOV in such OOV and of such OOV , that we OOV are no OOV able to OOV their OOV .
The OOV can be OOV , as a recent OOV in the OOV OOV once more .
<P> In my opinion , the OOV OOV OOV on citizens and OOV , OOV with the government ' s OOV to ensure OOV with the OOV OOV of rules , are reason enough to OOV the OOV of legislation and OOV of its quality OOV .
OOV I welcome the OOV OOV , which the Commission OOV in OOV and which is under OOV this OOV , as I OOV in my report , it is too OOV too OOV .
OOV to the OOV OOV as a whole , it is only a OOV in the OOV .
That is why I OOV in favour of OOV OOV , as well as OOV implementation OOV for the results of the OOV working parties and , OOV , for the OOV and OOV OOV in this respect .
<P> However , I OOV yet more importance to OOV legislation in its OOV .
OOV attention will need to be OOV to the way in which legislation is OOV .
OOV all , it is much OOV to take OOV measures in the OOV OOV than to OOV OOV legislation OOV on , at great OOV , also for OOV .
OOV available OOV must be made OOV on to OOV down OOV legislation and to OOV the OOV and financial OOV to a OOV .
<P> The OOV has OOV the recent OOV of OOV , which I mentioned a OOV OOV .
OOV is an OOV OOV OOV OOV it is to OOV OOV OOV proposals and to OOV any OOV OOV OOV on behalf of citizens and OOV .
OOV excellent initiative which , I hope , will be OOV OOV in other Member States and at EU level .
<P> I would make an OOV OOV to the European Commission to make a OOV OOV to improve the quality of legislation and to OOV the OOV OOV on citizens and OOV .
If the current situation OOV for much OOV , the European Parliament , too , will need to consider the OOV of OOV proposals OOV here on citizens and OOV .
If OOV OOV to come up with the OOV , we might have to OOV in the OOV of the OOV OOV and set up a OOV OOV which OOV out the OOV and financial OOV of legislation .
<SPEAKER OOV OOV OOV > Mr President , Commissioner OOV , ladies and gentlemen , the OOV legislation for the OOV market initiative is one of the most important OOV now OOV in the Union .
At least for my OOV in OOV , the OOV OOV , the OOV of legislation and an end to the OOV OOV out of OOV OOV one of the main OOV in the last European Parliament OOV .
I believe that much OOV is OOV to this approach in many other OOV too .
<P> The Commission OOV on the present state of the OOV OOV is very OOV , but by no means fully OOV , as yet .
It is OOV important that the Commission is able to make the proposals for the OOV ' s third and OOV OOV into clear OOV proposals as OOV and as OOV as possible .
OOV , the OOV OOV OOV by the rapporteur should be taken OOV .
I OOV support our rapporteur ' s proposals that the OOV of the legislation - the OOV of our decision OOV - should be OOV more than they have been when OOV proposals are being OOV .
OOV this OOV of OOV can fully OOV to OOV up the development of the European OOV market , and , OOV , OOV that OOV actually do OOV from legislation OOV and the OOV of the OOV .
<P> OOV OOV are OOV not enough : they must also be able to be OOV OOV both in Parliament and in the Council .
We do have OOV on OOV up the OOV process from time to time here in Parliament .
We OOV of the Committee on OOV and OOV OOV in particular OOV with interest the proposals by the OOV working OOV on new OOV of action that are to be OOV in the future , at least with regard to legislation on financial services .
OOV their OOV report was still not very OOV , it OOV OOV us to OOV that the working OOV is OOV a OOV in which only the OOV policy issues would be OOV through a OOV OOV OOV , OOV for other amendments to OOV of a more OOV OOV the OOV OOV would OOV .
In principle , I take a positive view of such proposals , although it is OOV difficult for us OOV to OOV OOV .
I believe that the OOV of OOV in certain OOV will be OOV to OOV the OOV OOV to the OOV market as OOV as possible .
OOV OOV position , and that of my group , will OOV OOV on what form the OOV OOV will take .
In no case should it be an OOV of the present OOV OOV , where there is a very great need for OOV , especially in the area of OOV .
OOV rapporteur also OOV to this .
<P> As OOV the general development of the OOV process , I also OOV with interest the Commission ' s OOV OOV on OOV it is OOV for the OOV OOV .
OOV the Commission OOV in its OOV will OOV how OOV new OOV for legislation are OOV with , and , how OOV the Union is as a whole for a long time OOV .
OOV , the OOV will OOV good , OOV proposals , but I also hope that we can still put some OOV into the OOV OOV .
<SPEAKER OOV NAME=" OOV " > Mr President , it is clear that OOV the quality of legislation is OOV to the OOV OOV of the OOV market and to OOV the OOV of the European OOV .
So we all welcome the OOV initiative , but we must all OOV the rapporteur 's OOV about how it has OOV so far .
There are OOV few areas which have been subject to the OOV process and it is not always clear why those particular areas have been OOV .
We need , without a OOV , a OOV OOV to OOV OOV OOV into OOV proposals , because it all OOV to take rather a long time .
<P> So we welcome the proposal to set up a OOV group within the OOV Committee and we welcome the rapporteur 's OOV that it should have more resources .
OOV we also need greater OOV between the different Commission OOV for OOV legislation .
We OOV think that the different OOV are OOV in OOV .
OOV , of course , we need greater cooperation between Member States and to OOV best OOV and OOV to OOV best OOV OOV .
<P> OOV OOV , it is OOV to ensure OOV OOV of the OOV of this legislation , particularly OOV , because they know best how this legislation OOV them .
<P> However , having said that , you could quite OOV OOV OOV , OOV legislation , yet it could be OOV OOV by the way that Member States OOV it and OOV it .
We must OOV that there are three OOV of legislation - OOV , implementation , including OOV , and OOV - and we have to see the process as a whole .
We often find the OOV problem is not the OOV legislation but how it has been OOV by Member States and the OOV at which they have OOV it , how they have OOV it and how they have OOV it .
I am often quite OOV by how OOV OOV OOV are OOV into the most OOV OOV as we go through that process .
<P> As part of this OOV OOV by the Commission to OOV legislation , I would like to see much greater cooperation between Member States and the Commission about the whole life of legislation and , particularly , OOV with the people who have OOV responsibility for OOV the legislation , who are often local and regional OOV .
So we must consider the whole process when we OOV the OOV legislation .
In some OOV , you could OOV , we should start at the end and look at how we OOV it and then work OOV as a way of OOV OOV legislation .
<P> But the OOV process OOV to go much further .
We need a OOV programme which will OOV all legislation and look at OOV , OOV , OOV , OOV OOV legislation .
OOV we may need to go for the OOV OOV , but we need a more OOV process than we have had so far .
<SPEAKER OOV OOV " NAME=" OOV " > Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , I OOV the rapporteur ' s concern about the fact that OOV , European OOV are OOV to issue OOV , OOV OOV OOV which are clear and OOV to people with OOV OOV OOV .
OOV OOV to Mr OOV , who has OOV to put his OOV on the problem .
<P> It should be OOV , OOV so , that EU citizens and OOV consider OOV legislation and OOV OOV to be OOV of a OOV of OOV within the OOV .
The OOV are OOV .
As long as the Commission does not OOV a clear , OOV approach to OOV , the OOV initiative OOV an OOV with no OOV OOV .
It should be OOV but that .
<P> In my opinion , two OOV need to be OOV into OOV , in OOV to the OOV which are OOV in the report .
OOV of all , the OOV initiative must be OOV a OOV OOV , particularly with EU enlargement on the OOV .
OOV , Member States must , as of now , set a good example by OOV a OOV , but OOV all , OOV OOV of European OOV into national legislation .
<P> OOV too often , we have been under the OOV that the process of OOV , which is so OOV , is much like a OOV of OOV .
OOV the Union ' s enlargement , we must OOV up a OOV if we want to OOV the OOV market in a OOV responsible OOV .
I am OOV that the Member State which I have the OOV of OOV here , has OOV that OOV measures need to be taken , as is the case in the OOV , to OOV legislation in a OOV OOV .
OOV of the need for OOV legislation , the OOV Group will be OOV the OOV report its OOV support .
<SPEAKER OOV NAME=" OOV " > Mr President , I wish to OOV by OOV that although I have been OOV OOV OOV , I should like to do my OOV for the OOV and OOV of OOV by OOV for less than OOV that time .
<P> I OOV the rapporteur on OOV such a very important issue and also OOV the OOV of the Commission to get to OOV with it OOV far .
I hope that the Commissioner will say what more is to be done to give OOV OOV to what is such a very important programme .
<P> However , rather than OOV the Commission more than the rapporteur has already done , rather even than OOV just to the OOV OOV involved in this particular issue , I should like to OOV one issue the rapporteur also OOV , which is that it is really OOV up to us , as Members of this House , to ensure that legislation is better in the first place .
OOV OOV to what OOV legislation should OOV into OOV and OOV an example OOV people OOV OOV .
That particular subject OOV up in the Committee on OOV and OOV OOV .
It must be said that this particular committee has OOV very OOV to the OOV OOV that we are now OOV the OOV to the Commission to OOV and OOV .
<P> OOV much better it would be if that committee , and indeed all other OOV , had OOV such legislation OOV in its OOV and OOV form in the first place .
<P> OOV OOV OOV is that for us the OOV OOV - " OOV OOV for the OOV OOV " - should OOV " OOV OOV OOV by Members " .
<SPEAKER OOV NAME=" OOV " > Mr President , I wish to OOV the rapporteur on his report and say that the proposals on the OOV of legislation in the OOV market that were OOV in OOV are very welcome .
OOV OOV was made there to improve the quality of legislation , to OOV to OOV down on OOV legislation and to OOV the costs OOV with OOV legislation .
<P> OOV that we have OOV the third and OOV OOV , with OOV of Member State OOV and OOV OOV OOV OOV to OOV legislation , it is right that we have a OOV .
We need to have OOV OOV of what is going on .
OOV OOV at the OOV OOV to be OOV OOV and we need some clear OOV for the OOV of the management OOV and , of course , the implementation of OOV which , at the OOV , are too OOV and too OOV .
OOV of the OOV are not OOV at all and many have to OOV OOV OOV of time .
<P> So we are in favour , but there are two things we want to OOV .
OOV , we have to ensure that political OOV OOV with the Commission and Parliament .
OOV OOV reports on the new approach to legislation OOV from the OOV and OOV - not so new now - which OOV the OOV of legislation to be OOV out by OOV OOV organisations , OOV to OOV that this is not always the best way forward .
The European Committee for OOV , for example , OOV did work on the OOV of OOV directive , which the OOV has OOV as OOV OOV , OOV OOV OOV and OOV to OOV the OOV of the directive or , for that matter , environmental OOV " .
So we need to ensure that there is political OOV there , OOV of course there are OOV political or OOV OOV to ensure that industry OOV progress .
<P> However , we would also wish to go further in a different OOV .
OOV OOV to have become OOV about OOV , even OOV in the OOV proposals we OOV about OOV costs .
What we would like to see are proposals for OOV with OOV of legislation as well as OOV .
<P> We therefore welcome the proposals from OOV for better OOV , which will look at the costs of legislation ; we welcome the OOV meeting of OOV of public OOV OOV in OOV on OOV OOV ; we welcome the OOV of the OOV group to look at OOV on making legislation more OOV ; but we are OOV that the OOV European Parliament OOV on that OOV group has not been OOV by Parliament OOV , as far as I OOV , have we been OOV to OOV such a OOV .
We welcome the fact that OOV OOV and OOV are OOV at various OOV OOV in this area .
<P> However , the Commission and Parliament will have to OOV to OOV on their own rules in OOV at the financial OOV of OOV proposals in order for them to be taken into account .
It can only OOV our work in the European Parliament if OOV can be made , for example , that the OOV directive will OOV us OOV a year in terms of the OOV to the OOV and the OOV but will only OOV OOV a year of OOV to the environment .
<P> OOV such OOV can be made , OOV we in this Parliament will look rather OOV .
<SPEAKER OOV OOV " NAME=" OOV " > Mr President , I would very much like to OOV the rapporteur , Mr OOV , on this particularly OOV and OOV report .
It OOV the need for OOV up our OOV efforts in order to improve the quality of new and OOV Community legislation - with good reason .
I therefore welcome the support OOV to the OOV initiative , as well as the support OOV by this Parliament .
<P> OOV OOV of the OOV initiative and this report have OOV where and how the initiative can be OOV .
OOV , in OOV with the OOV of the Member States , we are , in this OOV , OOV forward to making and OOV important OOV under the OOV of a OOV OOV OOV market OOV Committee .
OOV the OOV and OOV OOV of the OOV in OOV , we are OOV OOV OOV with regard to OOV which could be OOV an OOV .
OOV OOV in this OOV from this Parliament are , of course , welcome .
As OOV as agreement has been OOV on a OOV of OOV which can be OOV , we will OOV OOV of the OOV and OOV world , OOV organisations and trade OOV , all OOV to as the OOV OOV ' , every OOV of the way .
That should OOV them the opportunity of OOV to the OOV initiative , OOV OOV or OOV , and of being OOV of the progress made .
I am OOV that this approach will OOV all those taking part in this OOV OOV to OOV on the OOV issues of OOV , and that the OOV OOV will be making OOV and OOV OOV .
I am therefore OOV forward to OOV on the progress made during the next OOV of OOV .
<P> As you know , the Commission is OOV to OOV proposals to the best of its OOV within OOV OOV of OOV the OOV of the OOV OOV , OOV that these are OOV which it can OOV to .
We will make every OOV to OOV this OOV , and I am OOV Mr OOV in particular with this OOV .
<P> We are OOV with Mr OOV ' s OOV that Parliament and the Council will each OOV their OOV , by OOV OOV all proposals in this OOV , so as to ensure that the OOV initiative OOV as OOV as possible .
<P> I OOV Mr OOV ' s view that an OOV number of OOV areas should be OOV .
I am with OOV on that one .
I , too , would like to see this OOV .
That is , of course , only possible within the OOV OOV by other priority OOV and within the OOV OOV available .
<P> I would like to OOV this point .
The Commission OOV many OOV .
The Commission has many OOV , but it does not always have the means available to OOV these OOV OOV and OOV .
That is an important matter which also OOV much attention in this Parliament .
OOV , I have no OOV that we can OOV the OOV process , not least as a result of the work in which the Commission itself is involved .
<P> In OOV to the OOV made at the European Council in OOV , to OOV a OOV policy so as to OOV the OOV OOV , the Commission is OOV OOV its position on legislation in general to a OOV OOV in the OOV OOV of the OOV .
It is OOV areas where OOV OOV could be OOV .
OOV , it is OOV for the development of better OOV of OOV the OOV of OOV OOV legislation on the OOV world and industry , so as to OOV possible OOV OOV and OOV OOV OOV .
OOV OOV in this OOV was also OOV this OOV .
<P> The efforts which are now being made to OOV better legislation OOV with OOV for the OOV OOV on better management .
I am OOV this particularly for the OOV of Mrs OOV .
<P> The Commission ' s work will be OOV by the results of the OOV OOV in a OOV working group on better legislation , which was OOV by OOV of the OOV OOV following their meeting in OOV in OOV last .
It is this working group ' s OOV , and Mr OOV OOV for attention to be given to this , to OOV the quality and OOV of both national and Community legislation .
I am already OOV forward to the report and the OOV of this working group .
<P> This OOV process for which we all OOV some responsibility , concerns us all , of course .
I am OOV that the current political OOV in aid of a better OOV OOV within the European Union will OOV to real and OOV OOV .
I would also like to thank Mr OOV for the OOV OOV he OOV to the OOV OOV , OOV ' OOV OOV OOV by Members ' .
I am very OOV to OOV for that .
I will OOV to OOV this at the appropriate place and time , and those OOV the OOV OOV can OOV it .
<P> On a OOV OOV , I would like to OOV Mr OOV and your Parliament know that the amendments are OOV to the Commission .
<SPEAKER OOV NAME=" President " > OOV you very much Commissioner OOV , as OOV , for your OOV OOV in this debate .
<P> The debate is OOV .
<P> The vote will be taken OOV at OOV OOV .
OOV OOV OOV OOV in OOV education <SPEAKER OOV NAME=" President " > The next OOV is the OOV for second OOV ( OOV ) , by Mrs OOV OOV , on behalf of the Committee on OOV , OOV , OOV , the OOV and OOV , on the Council common position for OOV a European Parliament and Council OOV on European cooperation in quality OOV in OOV education OOV - OOV - OOV OOV .
<SPEAKER OOV OOV " NAME=" OOV OOV " > Mr President , the quality of education is high on the political OOV of every Member State , and that OOV as no OOV .
The third OOV OOV OOV OOV and OOV within a society which is OOV OOV more aware , more OOV , more OOV and more OOV , but at the same time where the concern about different OOV and OOV for people is OOV OOV OOV , because how does one ensure that OOV can OOV fully in this new OOV society ?
OOV must and can help here , and all these new OOV OOV education OOV and OOV , because education will OOV a OOV of change , and that is only the way OOV are OOV , and how they are OOV to OOV .
OOV , in OOV , OOV , information OOV and the different OOV .
That is why it is so important that the EU Member States OOV OOV and want to work together on OOV education , each OOV to their own OOV but , OOV there be no OOV , with a common OOV in OOV .
<P> As rapporteur , I am OOV OOV with the results of the common position as it is now before us .
OOV , I OOV the Commission proposal OOV OOV and very OOV , given the OOV importance of OOV education , and the Council was OOV from OOV OOV : OOV you do , do not OOV our OOV in education .
However , in the course of the OOV , they OOV to OOV Parliament ' s opinion that the quality of education should be OOV OOV and in a OOV OOV by , OOV other things , OOV up OOV , OOV quality OOV systems for OOV education , OOV education and OOV OOV OOV .
<P> The OOV are now clear in the amendments OOV by the OOV and OOV as rapporteur .
In these , we OOV clearly that Member States must OOV OOV quality OOV with OOV education as the OOV OOV .
This was not in the first Commission proposal , and OOV was the OOV of social OOV .
OOV OOV OOV to OOV and OOV , that was also OOV to OOV .
It was difficult to OOV the Council to OOV this OOV , but as rapporteur , I am OOV that both the Council and Commission are now in agreement with this .
<P> OOV OOV which was OOV to my OOV is that OOV , OOV and OOV too should be involved in the process .
This , too , has now been OOV , and this is important for the support OOV of OOV OOV and OOV in education .
It is also important to OOV OOV to OOV at national and European level .
However , I believe that OOV should not be OOV from OOV for OOV cooperation OOV in their OOV OOV within the region , and , in my opinion , this OOV could have been given more of an OOV in the report .
<P> Finally , I should like to OOV the importance of OOV information and OOV OOV and OOV , and of OOV these in a OOV which can be OOV OOV .
That is the OOV way of OOV .
It OOV me OOV OOV as rapporteur to see that the Member States have OOV down to work both OOV and under the OOV of the Commission and have set up a working committee of OOV that has OOV a OOV number of OOV and OOV .
Parliament will be OOV the OOV OOV .
<P> Mr President , Commissioner , the common position as it is now before us is the result of OOV and OOV cooperation with the Commission and the Council in the OOV of OOV , but particularly OOV to the OOV of my OOV OOV who have OOV their OOV with great OOV , the OOV has become a OOV , OOV and OOV one , which Member States can now start to use .
I am OOV to OOV your OOV .
<SPEAKER OOV LANGUAGE="FR" NAME=" OOV > Mr President , Commissioner , Mrs OOV , ladies and gentlemen , I wish to OOV by OOV Mrs OOV OOV for the work OOV has done and I welcome the OOV cooperation that has OOV between Parliament , the Council and the Commission , the OOV of which is the OOV that has just been OOV to us , a OOV which , I hope , will make a real contribution towards OOV the high quality education OOV Europe we OOV to .
<P> On behalf of my committee , the Committee on OOV and OOV OOV , I would particularly like to OOV the importance of OOV the quality of OOV in OOV and OOV OOV , and OOV to OOV a system for OOV good OOV and OOV OOV .
These are OOV of OOV social OOV and OOV OOV .
OOV quality education systems must OOV to achieve OOV , such as to get people into the OOV market , to OOV the number of young people OOV OOV OOV , our OOV to provide OOV OOV and to give people OOV to the new OOV .
<P> I must OOV two points in this quality OOV as OOV in the common position .
OOV of all , this process OOV a clear OOV between OOV OOV and the OOV OOV that we would like to see and that we would like to OOV and in which , as has been said , all OOV must take part .
<P> The second point which I would like to OOV has OOV not been fully taken on OOV , as we would have OOV .
What we do not want to do is to OOV the quality OOV process into a OOV for OOV a OOV , OOV or OOV OOV of OOV .
On the OOV , this form of OOV should OOV each OOV , however different in terms of its OOV or the OOV or resources used , to OOV all the OOV of OOV out , to improve the OOV quality of education for OOV and to OOV all OOV of all OOV by OOV education which is OOV to the OOV ' OOV and by OOV OOV to OOV their own OOV development needs .
<SPEAKER OOV NAME=" OOV " > Mr President , this report is OOV OOV by the OOV Group .
OOV , we have OOV it OOV the OOV OOV .
We OOV that OOV there was some OOV OOV from the Council but we are very OOV that , as a result of OOV OOV by the Commissioner and the OOV OOV of the rapporteur , a OOV was OOV last OOV that we can certainly support .
We OOV the Commissioner and the rapporteur on their work to achieve that .
We certainly all agree here in this OOV that education is of OOV importance and that an OOV OOV is the OOV of Europe 's future OOV .
OOV , any OOV to improve OOV in our OOV must be OOV with open OOV .
<P> We also all agree that education is OOV a matter for the OOV Member States and the regions .
But there is OOV for the Commission to OOV and improve OOV systems as OOV for in the Treaty and I was OOV to see that the Commission was OOV to OOV that this is to be OOV on OOV cooperation between the Member States .
<P> OOV , at the OOV it is difficult to get OOV each country 's various OOV systems and OOV OOV to OOV any OOV OOV of the OOV OOV of the countries .
As a OOV OOV OOV , I would have OOV a clear OOV of how OOV OOV and OOV OOV OOV to those of other European countries .
It is important in this OOV OOV to have as OOV an OOV as possible for the OOV system .
European OOV will OOV up , one OOV , OOV but also OOV that are OOV OOV by OOV systems OOV to a OOV OOV system .
OOV of the main OOV of education is to provide for the world of work as well as OOV a cultural OOV for Europe 's young people .
This report OOV a OOV between the need for OOV OOV in both those OOV .
<P> The OOV of OOV education systems OOV OOV will , I hope , OOV to OOV OOV European OOV OOV as OOV OOV from OOV OOV their OOV view .
The point made by Mrs OOV OOV about social OOV is particularly OOV .
I would like to see whether there are OOV in the OOV of the OOV OOV , whether this OOV in different OOV of Europe , and whether this OOV OOV of OOV education .
OOV there is the use of OOV OOV OOV : does this help in the OOV system of different countries ?
OOV different countries have different OOV ?
We would all be OOV to know how the OOV systems achieve OOV in two OOV OOV in OOV to the OOV OOV .
I OOV my own country will not do so well there but OOV we would do better on the use of information OOV .
<P> Finally , I would just like to say that the rapporteur 's amendments OOV for greater OOV and OOV of OOV OOV a OOV OOV in the OOV OOV .
The opinion of those within the OOV system is often OOV within the OOV civil OOV OOV and OOV which OOV OOV .
We must find OOV which give OOV back to the OOV and to the OOV and to the OOV because that is where responsibility should OOV .
<SPEAKER OOV NAME=" OOV > Mr President , Commissioner , education is OOV an OOV more important role in the European OOV .
The OOV of the OOV OOV OOV the importance of education both in OOV OOV and OOV OOV .
It is only OOV that the quality of OOV education should OOV attention also at Union level , although the OOV of education itself is the responsibility of the Member States .
We need OOV cooperation and OOV in all areas of education .
<P> OOV quality OOV in education is still in its OOV in many EU countries .
In OOV , for example , there were legal OOV OOV on it as part of national OOV legislation just two years OOV .
A report on the subject OOV in OOV last OOV OOV that OOV is not yet OOV OOV in OOV , although it has OOV OOV to a OOV start .
The report points out , for example , that OOV and high OOV education has not OOV OOV attention to cooperation between OOV , their OOV and the OOV of education .
The importance of including OOV and their OOV OOV in decision making is certainly OOV OOV in OOV .
<P> OOV cannot just be OOV at from the OOV point of view of OOV .
There must be OOV for different OOV of OOV , but , at the same time , we have to ensure that the OOV OOV OOV .
OOV has a major part to OOV in OOV an OOV and OOV society .
OOV education means that national resources are being put to the best possible use .
In my opinion , OOV must be OOV in such a way that all OOV OOV their OOV education can achieve OOV .
That is why the OOV of quality cannot just OOV on results , which give a OOV OOV of the situation .
OOV is not just about information and OOV OOV , but also OOV development , in the OOV , for example , of a OOV OOV of OOV .
<P> It is a positive OOV that a common position on the quality OOV of OOV education is OOV to be OOV so OOV .
Mrs OOV OOV , Commissioner OOV and the Council all OOV the OOV for this .
We are making good progress with this important issue .
<SPEAKER OOV OOV " NAME=" OOV " > Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , education is one of those areas of OOV which is very much part of what OOV on in a OOV , and so it should be .
This OOV must be OOV out as OOV to the OOV as possible , and that means that there will OOV OOV be a need for a general European education system .
But it is OOV because education is so important in the OOV on , not only of OOV and in the OOV of OOV , but it is also in the OOV on of cultural heritage and in the OOV of the OOV into the social OOV that OOV education is OOV .
OOV , we OOV OOV OOV of OOV into education and yet , there is an OOV need for European quality OOV .
That is why we would like to OOV our support in this matter .
<P> OOV know that education OOV a OOV OOV from OOV and OOV , but at the same time they OOV to see results .
In the OOV OOV , OOV OOV a good OOV was OOV , because it OOV our OOV OOV .
That OOV is no OOV enough on its own , and has not been for a long time .
OOV want quality education , and OOV who OOV OOV want to actually OOV what is important in life .
<P> OOV one of us can ask the question how important common quality OOV is in our own environment .
What it did OOV to in OOV is a high level of OOV in the OOV .
They OOV of their own OOV that they OOV to make a OOV in the world of education .
It has also OOV to OOV OOV of OOV and concern OOV the OOV .
In OOV , quality OOV used to be a OOV of a OOV subject , for example , for it was OOV that this would OOV OOV in the different OOV OOV .
We now see that the OOV is OOV .
The OOV for quality OOV in education has OOV up the OOV to this OOV European Community and to the OOV market of this European Community .
OOV OOV has OOV OOV become a common area of concern .
<P> OOV , I can OOV you the results of an OOV which was OOV OOV the OOV education system to OOV whether both OOV and OOV education OOV the common OOV .
It is quite OOV how much OOV attention this OOV OOV , OOV because they know that OOV , OOV and the OOV OOV environment OOV these results .
OOV all , each OOV , each OOV OOV , OOV to come out of this OOV OOV of OOV , but at the same time , each OOV OOV their OOV to OOV good OOV .
<P> It has come to my attention that the world of education has been OOV about a OOV of resources .
OOV all , not only do we want our OOV to do well at OOV , we also want their OOV to be well OOV , the OOV to be OOV , in other words the infrastructure to be up to OOV .
OOV , a great deal of resources are still OOV in many countries in order to achieve this .
<SPEAKER OOV LANGUAGE="DE " OOV " > Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I would like to take this opportunity to thank the rapporteur for OOV work .
I welcome the report and consider European cooperation in quality OOV in OOV education to be important in this OOV of information .
The European education systems must become OOV to the information society .
OOV OOV and OOV change , together with OOV , OOV OOV OOV OOV .
We need an education system that can OOV OOV to OOV OOV in OOV society .
<P> What OOV a good OOV education these OOV ?
OOV it about OOV OOV and OOV ?
There is more to it than that .
I believe it is the role of education in terms of the OOV of the OOV and his or OOV OOV in a OOV , OOV just and OOV society that is OOV to the OOV of a high quality education .
OOV people must be given the opportunity to OOV OOV and social OOV at OOV .
OOV is OOV to a good OOV education , and that OOV for OOV OOV and OOV on the OOV of society too .
They are particularly at OOV of social OOV because they are not as well OOV .
<P> I call upon the Member States of the European Union to ensure that OOV OOV the same OOV of education .
The social OOV between the OOV and the OOV must be OOV .
OOV OOV in OOV education is to be OOV for two OOV .
OOV , I regard the OOV as a way of OOV people to improve OOV education , and OOV , it OOV OOV of the quality OOV in education systems .
The Member States of the European Union must work together in the field of quality OOV in OOV education , because this is of OOV importance to OOV market policy and the OOV OOV of workers within the OOV
In OOV , organisations and OOV working in the field of quality OOV in OOV education should OOV at European level .
<P> We need European OOV so as to be able to OOV OOV support and to get the OOV OOV process OOV the OOV .
OOV all , OOV , OOV , and organisations can OOV from one another by OOV information and OOV and so find OOV OOV to OOV a good education .
I am OOV to the OOV of OOV a good education , as a way of OOV OOV and social OOV .
A OOV education is an OOV in the future , for the OOV of social progress , a OOV world and OOV .
<SPEAKER OOV LANGUAGE="FR" NAME=" OOV > Mr President , today we are OOV a OOV OOV to the Member States on quality OOV in education which may OOV some OOV OOV to the working OOV of the European Union and a OOV which has already made good progress at OOV OOV level .
As far back as OOV , at a OOV in OOV OOV by OOV European countries , the national OOV for OOV agreed to OOV a system of common OOV for their OOV and results .
OOV of all , they had to OOV a common OOV and then OOV results in order to OOV OOV , OOV OOV each Member State with full responsibility for its own education system .
<P> We will find this an OOV initiative as much from the point of view of its OOV as the OOV used .
As OOV OOV , on the one hand , education is OOV a OOV OOV in the OOV of the information and OOV society , for both human development and economic OOV .
We should , therefore , ensure that we get the most from the OOV OOV resources available to us .
So we can only be OOV at the OOV of the OOV between the Member States of the European Union which are OOV , in particular , from the first set of OOV OOV by OOV last OOV .
<P> For example , OOV the OOV level of public OOV OOV OOV in OOV education in Europe is OOV , OOV OOV OOV and OOV OOV .
The OOV is OOV quite OOV .
OOV , it does not always work the same way and OOV on the OOV .
That is why it is in all our interests to OOV our OOV .
<P> The OOV of OOV this OOV particularly OOV in the case of OOV , which has a very OOV education system that would OOV from being more OOV to the needs of the OOV OOV ' .
However , it is difficult to OOV out any OOV OOV because of this OOV .
<P> As OOV the OOV issues , on the other hand , the new cooperation in OOV of education systems could , in fact , OOV the way to a new , OOV OOV , OOV .
It OOV implementation of an open OOV of OOV , which has already been OOV upon at the OOV European Council and which , if it were OOV , could OOV a OOV between working OOV in Europe .
It would not be a question of OOV OOV with a view to OOV OOV .
In any case , OOV OOV and OOV of the Treaty OOV the European Community do not give the Community OOV in this area .
It is OOV a matter of together OOV out the best OOV , without , a OOV , OOV OOV in OOV OOV OOV and of OOV each country to OOV their own OOV .
<P> This new OOV of OOV will OOV a OOV Europe , which OOV OOV between the various OOV of OOV , OOV OOV . the national OOV of OOV , rather than a OOV Europe .
This OOV OOV is more OOV and OOV and more OOV than the OOV OOV directive .
In OOV , it can OOV OOV OOV the Union ' s OOV to OOV together OOV or more Member States , rather than OOV .
Mr President , we believe , for all these OOV , that this new and different OOV of cooperation OOV to have great OOV .
<SPEAKER OOV LANGUAGE="DE " OOV " > Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , I said by way of OOV , back in the debate OOV on OOV OOV on OOV OOV in OOV education " that the OOV for the future of young people are OOV in OOV , but not just in OOV .
<P> There are no two OOV about it , education , OOV OOV . OOV and further education , must take OOV OOV in all policy areas .
OOV is not an end in itself but is the OOV to our being able to OOV our own in the OOV OOV , not just in economic terms but also at a OOV level .
The OOV to the OOV society , the OOV of the OOV , social , OOV and environmental change , together with OOV OOV in the world of work , OOV not least to the new OOV : these are the OOV OOV we OOV in the third OOV , and they also OOV OOV efforts in the OOV field .
<P> So again , I welcome the fact that this report has come before the House , because its OOV is both to improve OOV education and the quality OOV OOV .
<P> OOV OOV - be they OOV or OOV - OOV OOV , and if the quality of education in European OOV is OOV as a result , and the OOV OOV OOV by the information society , OOV and OOV OOV and OOV change is taken into account , then this report will have OOV its OOV of OOV OOV OOV to efforts in the field of education , and a major OOV forward will have been taken at European level .
So OOV us help to ensure that the report on implementation , which the Commission is to put before Parliament in three years ' time , OOV OOV .
<P> OOV me OOV , on a OOV OOV , to say something that is OOV to the future of education , since I have just come from an OOV OOV , the OOV OOV of the OOV OOV ' s OOV .
There is more to education than OOV people for employment .
OOV OOV must be the OOV development of young people as OOV .
This OOV OOV OOV OOV , OOV and OOV , OOV OOV , and OOV people in OOV , OOV OOV , health and OOV .
<P> OOV , a OOV OOV OOV , which OOV important OOV and OOV out what is OOV , still OOV the basis for education in the OOV OOV .
So it OOV OOV of the OOV to say that OOV and information OOV only to be OOV from the OOV .
OOV who do not have OOV OOV do not know where to OOV OOV OOV .
The cultural OOV of OOV , OOV and OOV form part of this OOV OOV .
The new OOV OOV new OOV to OOV OOV and OOV our cultural OOV .
OOV those who have a OOV OOV know how to OOV OOV OOV , and how to OOV and OOV , in an OOV that has OOV an OOV in OOV .
That is why I feel this report OOV a OOV contribution to OOV the OOV of OOV at the OOV of our policy areas .
<SPEAKER OOV NAME=" OOV " > Mr President , I , too , would like to OOV those who have been responsible for OOV the report to this OOV .
<P> OOV , as we have been OOV , can be a OOV OOV in education , especially when one OOV at any form of OOV .
There are certain areas , such as OOV and OOV , where we can now OOV some OOV of what has been OOV .
There are many international OOV which have OOV up OOV , however , when it OOV to making OOV OOV , because of OOV in OOV , approach and the OOV OOV about what OOV a good education .
<P> It is OOV not to OOV education with OOV .
The OOV OOV of education is not to OOV people for the OOV market but to OOV them for a life which is OOV in every way .
In an OOV OOV or OOV working environment people will be OOV back on their OOV resources at many OOV in their OOV and social OOV is OOV OOV on such OOV OOV .
We only have to look at what OOV to those who are OOV out of work or who are OOV from the OOV market .
<P> So when we are OOV the quality of education , we want to see if we can OOV people who have OOV and OOV , who can OOV OOV , who can look OOV the information for the OOV OOV , who can question , who can work as part of a OOV and OOV , and who are OOV , OOV and have an OOV of the OOV world and their responsibility to it .
<P> I also think that when we are OOV at the quality of education we need to see if it is OOV real OOV of opportunity for all of those within the system or whether it is OOV , as society does , so much to OOV people on OOV of a OOV OOV or their OOV or OOV .
<P> So in our OOV and OOV we have to look OOV OOV OOV OOV OOV .
OOV all , every OOV OOV in a OOV OOV upon the level of OOV and the OOV of the very best .
It does not OOV improve the OOV of all .
<P> I am OOV to see that we are OOV the importance of OOV OOV themselves in the development and OOV of our OOV system .
We cannot OOV to OOV fully OOV and responsible OOV if they are not OOV to be OOV and OOV about this major OOV of their OOV .
OOV all , education OOV done is a OOV OOV and we know we have a OOV to OOV from each other .
That is why I welcome this report .
<SPEAKER OOV OOV NAME=" OOV " > Mr President , OOV in general and OOV in OOV education in particular are not a OOV OOV .
OOV OOV is always to OOV if the OOV being OOV has OOV the OOV OOV of the OOV OOV the OOV , who OOV both the OOV OOV and the OOV of their being OOV or not .
<P> OOV on the part of the Member States in OOV OOV education is OOV an important OOV for OOV in the Member States ' education systems , the OOV being to OOV an education OOV which is a far OOV from a OOV , OOV and OOV OOV general education .
A OOV which is even a far OOV from the principle of OOV that OOV is given the same start in life .
A OOV which costs OOV but which OOV the needs of OOV OOV for a OOV and , more OOV , OOV OOV OOV , a OOV OOV which is OOV OOV to its OOV .
This policy results in OOV in general education for the OOV of OOV which OOV OOV OOV ; it even results in general education being OOV by an OOV process of OOV OOV .
It also results in the OOV - and OOV OOV - OOV being OOV out of OOV education into OOV OOV , as is the case in OOV , where the number of OOV form OOV has OOV by OOV % in a few years following the OOV education OOV .
OOV also OOV to OOV a OOV which can be used to OOV OOV to OOV in a OOV environment in which the best OOV OOV the best OOV , the best OOV and the most OOV - in other words to OOV on market OOV .
This will result in OOV OOV in the OOV of OOV , especially in OOV OOV and the OOV .
In OOV , the system of OOV OOV the government 's responsibility for the quality of education on to OOV , OOV and OOV .
<P> If we were OOV OOV in the quality of education , we would not be OOV on OOV OOV but on OOV the OOV of education for OOV .
The debate on how to OOV out OOV is OOV and OOV .
What does make OOV is to debate the OOV of the problem .
What OOV of OOV do OOV OOV and for what OOV of society ?
If we were to OOV today 's OOV on the basis of this OOV , we would OOV OOV that they have a long way to go to OOV the needs of the workers and for social progress .
<SPEAKER OOV OOV " > Mr President , I welcome this OOV and fully support the European Parliament and Council decision to OOV cooperation and quality OOV in OOV education .
I particularly welcome the OOV on social OOV .
OOV is an important , indeed OOV , part of society .
OOV education has an OOV on all our OOV and our OOV as well .
<P> OOV reports , as those of us from the OOV are aware , have OOV to OOV the OOV of OOV at a very young OOV as this could OOV OOV .
It would therefore be good to OOV and OOV with other European OOV , within OOV of course , as my OOV Mrs OOV has already OOV .
<P> OOV , for example , OOV great importance to social OOV and OOV OOV , working in OOV ; OOV .
These are OOV OOV on the OOV than OOV and at an OOV OOV .
I also fully agree with better OOV between OOV , OOV and OOV and the many OOV OOV who OOV want to OOV a role in education and its development and achieve , as a result , the OOV of the OOV as the OOV .
<P> It will also provide an excellent opportunity to OOV OOV in the different regions to OOV in good OOV .
OOV between different countries are so important , as indeed are OOV not only between countries but between OOV and OOV OOV .
This is part of a very important OOV OOV and OOV that is well OOV in Europe and is OOV such a OOV OOV all our OOV .
OOV is so important .
I OOV that the OOV of good OOV and the OOV of information between the different OOV in Europe should not OOV into a OOV OOV .
We should at all costs OOV any OOV to OOV European OOV OOV of OOV OOV to that in the OOV that has OOV so OOV .
<P> I welcome the report , it is a positive OOV and one that we can OOV on to OOV better OOV OOV within the European Union .
<SPEAKER OOV LANGUAGE="FR" NAME=" OOV " > Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , we are only at the OOV of the new year and I believe that it is still appropriate to say to you and your OOV that I hope this year will see all your OOV come OOV .
OOV OOV here at the European Parliament and the Commission , I hope that we continue to work on the same good terms as we have done in the OOV .
<P> OOV ' s OOV is to OOV the OOV OOV on quality OOV of OOV education .
This OOV has already made good progress and had the full OOV of the European Parliament .
I would like to thank Parliament for its OOV support which was OOV to its political will to OOV OOV , something that was , at OOV , difficult .
Parliament made many positive OOV which , over the years , have been put into OOV in the field .
I would particularly like to give OOV OOV to the rapporteur , Mrs OOV OOV , for the excellent work that OOV has OOV out in extremely OOV time OOV and I would also like to OOV my OOV to OOV in the Committee on OOV , OOV , OOV , the OOV and OOV .
<P> You have before you a OOV OOV which , as some of you have mentioned , OOV to a OOV issue at the OOV of our political OOV , to OOV , can we OOV OOV in the quality of OOV education and , if so , how do we go about it so that the European Union can give this a OOV of a OOV in the right OOV , without OOV in European systems which are , and OOV , the responsibility of the national OOV for OOV ?
<P> You are aware that we have already made OOV progress towards this OOV , since the OOV of the major OOV OOV to OOV the quality of OOV education OOV place at the OOV of the OOV OOV year .
OOV OOV OOV OOV in OOV countries OOV part in this OOV .
The OOV OOV is , to a great OOV , OOV on the OOV which we OOV OOV from this OOV .
<P> The OOV OOV to two OOV points .
OOV of all , that of OOV as an OOV to improve quality - the OOV of which is not to OOV who is OOV and who is OOV of the OOV , but rather OOV to OOV as an OOV so that OOV OOV up at the OOV of the OOV .
OOV , the role of European cooperation in this area .
This is , OOV , something we know how to do very well , and we have OOV as much .
<P> In this OOV , the proposal OOV OOV , OOV OOV and OOV all OOV to OOV a part in every OOV of the OOV process so that , in the end , OOV are OOV to OOV from each other and can OOV good OOV and the most OOV OOV for OOV .
<P> In this process , the Commission shall not OOV any rules and is OOV its role as a OOV .
It is OOV European cooperation between OOV and OOV them to OOV a OOV OOV .
It is OOV to set up a OOV of OOV and OOV to be used by OOV in OOV and which will then by available to all OOV involved .
<P> That is OOV what the OOV European Council OOV us to do .
If we wish to place European society at the OOV of the world OOV as an example of the OOV society , then clearly , the extremely high quality of OOV in OOV in every Member State , area and OOV should be the OOV OOV ' OOV for social OOV OOV citizens .
Mr OOV said that , in today ' s OOV , we are OOV the society and the OOV of OOV ' s society and I agree with this OOV .
OOV this OOV , it is our responsibility to provide every available OOV and to ensure that OOV OOV from each other , that the system OOV OOV and that no one is OOV by the OOV .
<P> That is actually the OOV of a OOV society .
We cannot OOV OOV the OOV of OOV % , at the very least , of OOV being OOV by the OOV because they have not OOV the education they need to be able to do well in society .
I agree with those of you who , on this point , said that you need to OOV for life in society before OOV for life on the employment market .
OOV , that is a OOV OOV for a society that needs all its human resources in order to progress .
<P> OOV and gentlemen , together with the OOV for OOV , we are making these proposals on quality OOV to OOV us to give this opportunity to all young people , because if they OOV a high quality education then it is OOV that they will be able to do well in society and be able to find a OOV .
<P> That is why I would once again like to thank Mrs OOV OOV , the rapporteur , as well as the Committee on OOV , OOV , OOV , the OOV and OOV and all the Members who have OOV us in this work .
<P> I would like to OOV you that , following the OOV Council ' s OOV to make OOV and quality a priority issue , action OOV of the OOV programme has put out to OOV within this very specific area .
This will result in OOV OOV being made and OOV OOV being OOV .
<P> I would also like to OOV you that , at the OOV of OOV , the Swedish Presidency will be OOV a OOV at OOV and that the OOV OOV Presidency has already OOV to work on this issue during its presidency .
You will , therefore , have OOV , ladies and gentlemen , that this is not the last time that we shall be OOV this issue and that I shall be OOV here on a OOV basis to OOV to you in OOV about new and , OOV , all positive , OOV .
<SPEAKER OOV NAME=" President " > OOV you very much , Mrs OOV .
<P> The debate is OOV .
<P> The vote will take place OOV at OOV OOV .
OOV OOV OOV cultural and OOV heritage <SPEAKER OOV NAME=" President " > The next OOV is the debate on the report ( OOV ) by Mrs OOV OOV , on behalf of the Committee on OOV , OOV , OOV , the OOV and OOV , on the OOV in the EU countries of the OOV for the OOV of the OOV OOV and OOV OOV OOV OOV <SPEAKER OOV LANGUAGE="FR" NAME=" OOV OOV > Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , it is a OOV to say that our heritage and its OOV are OOV OOV of European OOV , a OOV but OOV , OOV .
OOV heritage is one of the most OOV OOV , one of those OOV to the OOV of our OOV citizens .
It OOV part of their OOV environment and their own OOV .
It OOV the OOV of OOV to the European Union by OOV the OOV we all OOV .
OOV of heritage is therefore a OOV OOV in view of the OOV it OOV over time , but also in view of the new OOV of OOV it is OOV , such as OOV OOV , OOV OOV , OOV OOV and , OOV , many OOV .
<P> The European Parliament has OOV this matter very OOV with , in particular , two OOV adopted in OOV and OOV , which provide a OOV of OOV for the action to be OOV in this field .
I now consider it necessary to OOV the current situation on this issue , taking into account both the principle of OOV and the development of the European Union OOV to the OOV number of Member States .
<P> It is OOV OOV the OOV of the OOV OOV , which is to OOV heritage and not to OOV it on a heritage OOV .
OOV the last time OOV were OOV in OOV 2000 , OOV OOV have been OOV to the OOV OOV OOV , OOV of which are OOV within the European Union .
OOV these OOV OOV , OOV are cultural OOV , OOV are OOV OOV and OOV are OOV of OOV OOV .
The fact that the European Union is OOV OOV on this OOV , with OOV a third of the OOV , is OOV OOV in terms of Europe ' s contribution to world OOV .
However , in order to OOV a better OOV on the OOV between the various OOV and also between States , OOV has OOV up a world OOV and an action plan for the implementation of that OOV .
I think it appropriate that Parliament OOV that Member States that can OOV themselves on a OOV number of OOV OOV should OOV the number of OOV they OOV in future .
I think it OOV OOV that they should make a contribution towards making the world OOV more OOV and more OOV , both OOV and in terms of its OOV .
<P> OOV this report was adopted by Parliament ' s Committee on OOV , OOV , OOV , the OOV and OOV , the two OOV on OOV OOV were OOV by a very OOV OOV .
I do however feel , ladies and gentlemen , that these OOV should be OOV , and I have therefore OOV two amendments to this OOV on behalf of the OOV Group .
OOV proposal was made in the report for a European OOV to be OOV up , for OOV OOV heritage OOV OOV from a OOV point of view , which OOV their OOV of what a OOV is .
A OOV may be OOV , for example , without any regard for the OOV .
A OOV OOV may be OOV without regard for the OOV .
I feel that Europe , the European Union , on the other hand should look at things from a OOV point of view .
It could therefore take action on OOV OOV of heritage and , from this point of view , a European OOV may OOV real progress .
It would make it possible to OOV the OOV of OOV which are of more than OOV national importance but which are not yet OOV world OOV .
That would OOV help to OOV Europe OOV to the people , OOV them an OOV of a OOV cultural heritage .
<P> There is often need for heritage to be OOV .
The Commission should OOV up a report on the position of OOV in Member States with a view to OOV the OOV sector in order to OOV the quality of such work .
OOV OOV OOV OOV OOV , and the need for OOV should not OOV the need for quality work .
Finally , I OOV that the European Commission should , in OOV with the Council of Europe and OOV , look into the OOV of a legal and OOV OOV in order to OOV OOV of OOV OOV to the OOV of the cultural and OOV heritage .
This OOV might be OOV in the OOV on the OOV of European OOV systems .
OOV of heritage is an area over which we must be OOV OOV .
It is our responsibility to hand this heritage on to future OOV .
The young people of Europe must be able to OOV themselves in this in order to OOV their future and to be able to OOV their European OOV more clearly .
OOV the OOV of being European OOV far more to cultural OOV than to economic and social OOV ?
<P> In OOV , OOV me OOV this OOV which you will all OOV as OOV from one of the great OOV of the European Union , " If I had to start again , I would start with OOV . "
It is something which could have been said by OOV OOV in OOV , OOV OOV OOV in OOV , or OOV OOV in OOV .
It is the OOV , the OOV we all OOV when OOV through the European Union and OOV at the OOV we find there and the OOV we feel that , OOV to the OOV of the European Union , we are in some small way OOV , and also their OOV for all time .
<SPEAKER OOV LANGUAGE="DE " NAME=" OOV " > Mr President , Commissioner , world cultural heritage - we have just OOV the OOV - is OOV OOV OOV .
OOV of it is here in Europe , which is something we can be very OOV of , although it also OOV that there are certain OOV .
OOV , there are very few OOV , OOV OOV . OOV that have been OOV part of world cultural heritage , in OOV with the number OOV in the OOV of the world , and it is a real OOV in the OOV , because there are many more OOV that would OOV this OOV of OOV and support .
<P> This OOV OOV the OOV process OOV the OOV OOV .
OOV OOV are OOV than are OOV , and I think there is a need to OOV the OOV .
The OOV of cultural heritage OOV the OOV of a country ' s own regions , which is why responsibility must OOV be taken and OOV at regional level , OOV OOV that they must be OOV OOV support from OOV , from the European Union and from all those who are OOV responsible .
<P> These regional OOV OOV the OOV of OOV , OOV and OOV , the development of a country ' s own regions and so on and so OOV .
As I see it , these are OOV that can OOV only be OOV at regional level .
The importance of world cultural heritage OOV OOV the OOV of regional development .
They are cultural OOV , and OOV OOV to OOV OOV and OOV OOV in OOV .
They have OOV OOV OOV .
OOV cultural heritage , OOV OOV and OOV by OOV and OOV cultural heritage OOV together , but the OOV is not OOV OOV it also OOV OOV to OOV OOV , from the world of work for example , such as OOV in working life , the OOV of OOV , OOV and so on and so OOV .
<P> They OOV the development of the working process of our OOV , and also OOV in the world .
It is therefore just as important to OOV the OOV of OOV OOV as it is to OOV the OOV OOV of the OOV of social OOV .
OOV OOV development and OOV in our environment really OOV OOV how important it is to OOV a OOV for our OOV heritage and take responsibility , in other words development OOV and OOV of OOV OOV OOV must OOV more OOV in our responsibility for the OOV of our cultural heritage .
<P> OOV , when OOV world cultural heritage OOV , there must be more OOV on OOV a OOV between OOV OOV , OOV OOV , the various OOV from OOV OOV , OOV OOV and OOV heritage , and the OOV OOV must be OOV with this in OOV .
The OOV of our cultural heritage is OOV not only with a high level of responsibility , but also with high OOV of OOV .
We therefore need to find OOV of OOV the OOV OOV , of OOV the legal and OOV OOV and OOV OOV with OOV to make us more OOV of this responsibility .
<SPEAKER OOV OOV NAME=" OOV " > Mr President , in the European Union and in this Parliament , we must deal with what is OOV for European cooperation , OOV that which OOV a OOV and OOV Europe , and we must be very OOV not to take on any OOV which more OOV OOV to the Member States .
It is important to OOV cultural heritage , and the Union ' s common cultural heritage is its OOV .
It is a great and OOV responsibility to OOV this OOV in every OOV Member State .
I therefore consider this report to be OOV .
On the basis of the principle of OOV , it is my view that OOV cultural heritage is a OOV for the Member States .
OOV OOV now , the Member States have OOV OOV the OOV OOV the OOV of the OOV OOV and OOV OOV by OOV proposals - many of them - for OOV on OOV s OOV of OOV of OOV OOV OOV .
<P> There is OOV a OOV high number of European OOV on the OOV and , as the rapporteur OOV , a OOV more OOV might well be in order .
I do not think it OOV without OOV that there should be a OOV OOV OOV European cultural heritage .
OOV do I think it necessary for the Commission to take on the major OOV of OOV the OOV , as many have OOV .
On behalf of the Group of the European OOV , OOV and OOV OOV , I have therefore OOV a OOV of amendments OOV Parliament is to call upon the Member States , and not the Commission , to OOV the necessary cooperation in OOV with OOV and the Council of Europe .
I have done this in order to OOV the principle of OOV and also with OOV to OOV OOV s words here in Parliament last year when he said , " OOV us OOV how often we have been made into a OOV OOV because we deal with things that are OOV OOV , which OOV common OOV and conflict with the interests of our OOV " .
I think that this is an area in which we can put the Union ' s work on OOV for a OOV OOV .
<SPEAKER OOV OOV NAME=" OOV " > Mr President , the Committee on OOV , OOV , OOV , the OOV and OOV OOV our OOV on its initiative to OOV this report on how we can OOV our cultural and OOV heritage in the European Union , as does the rapporteur for the OOV and measures which OOV OOV , the OOV of which I agree with .
<P> OOV - to come back to what the OOV OOV said - every Member State of the European Union has a policy on these issues .
OOV , we have no OOV of OOV national policy .
However , we really do need a more general OOV and a policy at Union level .
OOV the reason is clear : it is because all Union OOV have a OOV OOV on how we OOV and OOV our cultural and OOV heritage - OOV a OOV OOV .
<P> For example , the Union OOV funds OOV and OOV through the OOV OOV which OOV or OOV OOV OOV , the OOV and other OOV of our cultural and OOV heritage .
There are , OOV , OOV OOV from OOV OOV .
We OOV long and OOV some time OOV to OOV the OOV OOV from being OOV OOV the OOV OOV OOV , where it would have OOV the OOV from OOV the OOV .
OOV of OOV from OOV organisations , the question of OOV OOV on the OOV OOV was taken to the OOV Council , the OOV OOV Court in OOV , which OOV new OOV in its OOV and OOV , yet again , the OOV of the OOV of the OOV on these OOV .
OOV , the question is still in OOV of the new OOV OOV in OOV in OOV , an OOV OOV OOV OOV for the whole of Europe as well as a particularly important OOV which was OOV OOV in the OOV 2000 OOV , Commissioner .
We should like to OOV it , quite how I do not know .
<P> The OOV is also in OOV of the new OOV on the OOV , a OOV 's OOV from the OOV OOV and the OOV .
It is to be OOV on OOV of OOV OOV OOV , OOV OOV both the OOV in question and the OOV of the whole area and the OOV OOV up to the OOV OOV OOV and the OOV .
<P> This OOV and many OOV have one OOV in common : they hope to OOV , or they are already in OOV of , Community OOV .
It is therefore quite clear why I OOV support the particular points in the resolution which call on the Commission to OOV OOV from the point of view of their OOV on cultural and OOV heritage , their OOV importance and their OOV OOV , all of which should be made into OOV OOV , before any OOV is OOV .
<SPEAKER OOV LANGUAGE="FR" OOV OOV OOV " > Mr President , Mrs OOV OOV s report OOV to OOV the OOV of heritage and the OOV for the OOV of national heritage OOV in particular .
The OOV Group will vote in favour of this report .
<P> No one can question the need to OOV this OOV to OOV which are not just OOV , OOV OOV or OOV OOV .
There is clearly a great deal of OOV OOV which can be OOV and OOV as world heritage .
The importance of OOV heritage or OOV in the OOV OOV may be OOV , the OOV of OOV , OOV and OOV of which still OOV to be OOV out in a good many countries .
<P> This heritage , which OOV OOV the OOV OOV which often OOV only OOV or OOV , is often a OOV in the OOV OOV of the people OOV on this OOV .
It is this OOV and OOV in OOV and OOV life which should OOV the very OOV of heritage , as indeed Mrs OOV mentioned .
<P> I should therefore like to OOV , for example , particularly here in OOV , the importance which our OOV citizens OOV to their national OOV and their OOV to consider it as a part of their heritage .
<P> The OOV OOV , OOV , OOV OOV a OOV OOV that OOV % of OOV are OOV to the OOV and wish to OOV it .
This OOV is an OOV , because in OOV OOV the OOV is as much as OOV % .
<P> The OOV OOV OOV , responsible for OOV the OOV of the OOV , OOV OOV on his OOV a very OOV OOV on the OOV people ' s OOV to their OOV .
This is , OOV , a OOV OOV ' because they were , of course , OOV their opinion on the OOV and not on the OOV
OOV , the OOV was OOV .
OOV OOV % of the OOV have OOV in this OOV OOV .
I think it OOV OOV you of the real state of OOV , given that this is something that does not OOV to have been taken into OOV or to have any OOV over the European Parliament .
<P> In OOV OOV , which has for the OOV OOV to OOV its national heritage in the form of the OOV OOV , only OOV % of young people in the OOV OOV OOV wish to give up the OOV .
OOV this OOV , the OOV % of OOV who OOV a OOV OOV would make the recent OOV in OOV look like a vote in favour of the OOV OOV .
<P> OOV are OOV to their own OOV just as they are OOV to their own OOV , their own OOV , their own OOV heritage OOV , their own OOV and their own OOV .
This is how national OOV should be OOV , as if they were part of world heritage .
This is the OOV of the OOV I have OOV on behalf of my group and which I OOV you to support .
<SPEAKER OOV OOV NAME=" OOV > Mr President , I should like to OOV Mrs OOV OOV , who has set out and OOV on the subject of a OOV OOV the OOV of world cultural and OOV heritage in the Member States of the European Union , OOV in OOV report the OOV interest which Europe needs to have in this important issue , together with the OOV which need to be taken OOV the world .
<P> OOV OOV did not take the OOV decision of OOV OOV from the OOV OOV , OOV OOV us to take a more OOV OOV towards OOV , what is important , as the report OOV , is that the European Union is working to OOV a OOV cultural area .
OOV important , in my view , is Europe 's OOV , as the report OOV , that it is OOV on the OOV OOV OOV and that this OOV OOV both to OOV OOV and to OOV OOV , as OOV with other OOV of countries , to OOV in OOV to other OOV and OOV and to OOV ' as OOV to OOV OOV .
This OOV OOV that the OOV of cultural OOV and respect for what is OOV is an OOV OOV right at the OOV of the problem and will help Europe OOV a OOV role in OOV to the OOV of the world in the OOV of OOV .
<P> As far as the proposals are concerned , I think that the proposal to take the initiative on OOV at OOV level is especially important , as is OOV action by the Member States to OOV the OOV of and the OOV trade in OOV OOV within the countries of the European Union .
<P> OOV - and here I agree with Mr OOV - I think that cultural OOV OOV should be a OOV OOV when OOV which OOV to OOV with European OOV , so that we OOV OOV what is often OOV OOV .
It is to be OOV that the OOV 2000 programme has OOV one third of its OOV to cultural , OOV , OOV and OOV heritage and to OOV , OOV and OOV , OOV OOV national action .
<P> However , as the report points out , attention must be OOV to OOV heritage , to OOV and OOV OOV , to OOV and OOV , in other words to what are OOV more or less OOV issues .
OOV and OOV in all OOV involved in OOV , OOV and OOV cultural and OOV heritage are also important , as are OOV OOV ' and young people 's OOV and OOV a OOV of OOV OOV which can also make a OOV contribution .
<SPEAKER OOV OOV " NAME=" OOV OOV " > Mr President , Commissioner , this is a OOV and very OOV report .
I would therefore like to thank the rapporteur for the OOV of work OOV has put into it .
It OOV , at least , that the European Union and the Member States have done their OOV , and have done it well .
They have OOV many OOV , so much so that this has OOV to an OOV .
In my opinion , this is OOV to the opinion that it is especially OOV that must be OOV .
There are , of course , also other OOV , and I believe we should OOV Member States to take measures so that we can OOV the OOV and be more OOV .
<P> OOV own group is OOV whether or not the European Union has a OOV here .
OOV of all , the OOV of our cultural heritage , also at European level , OOV to the OOV .
OOV OOV OOV OOV are always very well OOV .
OOV cultural heritage is an excellent OOV to make the European OOV OOV .
<P> OOV , European OOV OOV is OOV in many areas , for example in OOV OOV in the OOV OOV region and OOV OOV .
The European Union can OOV Member States to OOV , and can OOV support in all cultural areas , for example .
<P> OOV point where the European Union can OOV a OOV European OOV is OOV and education .
So is OOV OOV as to which areas OOV national interests .
OOV OOV and OOV is necessary at every OOV level , and it is important to OOV up all the OOV and OOV when taking environmental action .
<P> OOV , I would OOV the OOV of OOV funds .
OOV cultural heritage is important for OOV .
It OOV cultural OOV into OOV .
It has a OOV on employment .
The question of whether the European Union has a OOV is not a question to me .
In this area , the European Union has a OOV to OOV , support and make OOV Europe ' s common cultural heritage .
OOV , I , OOV with OOV in my group , will give my OOV support to the rapporteur ' s report .
<SPEAKER OOV OOV " NAME=" OOV > Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , it so OOV that I was involved in the OOV OOV of the OOV OOV in a particular case .
At a OOV meeting some years OOV in OOV , the issue was OOV of whether to make the OOV OOV OOV a OOV OOV OOV .
I OOV to OOV OOV OOV at this point , for I OOV the OOV of OOV the OOV OOV OOV , which OOV a whole OOV of different areas , together as one OOV rather OOV .
I was OOV by the OOV OOV between the OOV OOV - certainly not OOV to any OOV of OOV 's but because of the OOV OOV of the OOV put forward by the States .
I also OOV the OOV OOV of some cultural , OOV or OOV OOV .
In this regard , Mr OOV of our group , who is the OOV of OOV , OOV us OOV , a few OOV OOV , that OOV has OOV been OOV as a OOV OOV OOV .
<P> OOV then , upon OOV the OOV my OOV was OOV : the OOV OOV OOV is now OOV .
In the OOV , we have become much more OOV towards OOV and the environment - consider the OOV OOV development ' .
This is why I am OOV that the report will OOV to be full of OOV : some issues need to be OOV because of the need for OOV between European countries rather than European OOV , which can be OOV and are OOV used by the Member States as an OOV to OOV their OOV .
OOV , in certain OOV , the OOV already OOV .
I would point out - and this is a positive fact - that the OOV OOV to regional OOV OOV , which are OOV by a OOV of OOV measures .
<P> OOV , there are some good points .
I would point out that there must be a policy of OOV OOV OOV as the OOV of OOV OOV well if the OOV also OOV the OOV of OOV ; the OOV OOV to by the OOV , which are OOV , are certainly not OOV for OOV OOV , especially in OOV OOV countries .
It would be a good OOV for the Commission , OOV or OOV , to OOV the OOV which State aid may OOV , as OOV down in OOV OOV OOV OOV OOV ) .
<SPEAKER OOV LANGUAGE="SV" NAME=" OOV " > Mr President , Commissioner , I am going to OOV that area of Europe ' s cultural heritage which is not OOV on OOV s OOV and which is OOV OOV on our own OOV .
It has to do with the fact that OOV every second OOV OOV of the European Union is OOV , both the agricultural OOV and OOV given over to OOV .
The whole of Europe ' s current OOV OOV is a result of OOV OOV OOV years of OOV and OOV .
It is the OOV of cooperation between OOV , the OOV , OOV and the human being as OOV .
That is what has given us the OOV OOV and OOV Europe with which we are OOV .
I OOV believe that cultural heritage is a responsibility for regions and OOV and not , in the first place , for the European Union .
There is , however , one area in which the Union has OOV OOV over cultural heritage , OOV agricultural policy .
<P> If I were in a position to OOV , I should OOV the OOV s current agricultural policy for a policy which OOV cultural heritage and OOV OOV .
I should like to use OOV to OOV the OOV OOV OOV the Mediterranean and to OOV the OOV OOV and OOV OOV OOV in the OOV areas OOV OOV and OOV in OOV OOV OOV .
In OOV , a good cultural policy for Europe would be a OOV , OOV and OOV agricultural policy .
<SPEAKER OOV LANGUAGE="FR" NAME=" OOV " > Mr President , I feel that the OOV of cultural and OOV heritage - quite OOV from the matter of who is responsible for what under the Treaty - is of importance to OOV , because - OOV me say this before OOV to the OOV of the matter - like you , I consider that our heritage is made up of OOV , OOV OOV and OOV and cannot be OOV to one OOV , one region , or one country as it OOV to the OOV OOV of European citizens .
If we have any OOV in Europe it is our OOV of cultural OOV , and that OOV to all of us .
It does not OOV to just a small part of Europe , even if it OOV from that small part of Europe .
That is why we are all responsible for OOV our heritage and OOV this OOV .
If something is OOV from OOV ' s heritage , then it is also OOV to OOV , and if something is OOV in OOV , then it is also OOV to OOV .
OOV OOV with all the citizens of Europe OOV they are and OOV the role they have to OOV .
<P> OOV said that , ladies and gentlemen , OOV the Commission OOV the work OOV out by Parliament , especially the rapporteur , Mrs OOV OOV , and it OOV the concerns and the interests OOV by this report .
<P> OOV OOV , as you are well aware , the Treaty does not provide any legal basis for Community action in the field of OOV and rules out the OOV of OOV in this field .
OOV only is the Commission not in a position to OOV up its own OOV of cultural and OOV heritage OOV and OOV , but it is rather OOV to consider OOV to the number of OOV OOV .
<P> OOV OOV to my OOV OOV , this does not OOV our responsibility in the area of heritage OOV .
<P> We have , indeed , always OOV with the international OOV , OOV OOV , OOV , OOV , regions and OOV that have OOV so OOV to OOV their heritage and our heritage .
In particular , we can OOV the OOV action OOV with the Council of Europe and with OOV , such as , for OOV , the " Europe , a common heritage " OOV , or the OOV OOV to support OOV ' s heritage .
This cooperation must continue , not just in order to OOV the OOV OOV of OOV in OOV areas , but also to improve the OOV of the international legal and OOV framework which some OOV have mentioned .
I should , OOV , like to point out that under the OOV and OOV 2000 programmes , we are most OOV in our OOV to OOV the public , regions , OOV and OOV OOV , in order to support all those working at OOV level to OOV the heritage OOV by all European citizens .
<P> The OOV of OOV that have been OOV OOV OOV OOV the OOV of and OOV the OOV of the public , especially young people , because , as you OOV state , OOV our heritage and OOV is a matter of education .
OOV have also OOV the OOV of the OOV and OOV used by heritage workers in Europe , especially those OOV by the OOV OOV for the OOV of OOV OOV in OOV , and the further OOV of workers and OOV OOV in the area of OOV , an area we have OOV to OOV through our education programmes , OOV in order to OOV a OOV of OOV OOV of OOV with various OOV OOV OOV .
<P> OOV and gentlemen , I can OOV you that we OOV to continue on these OOV , within the OOV of our OOV and our , as you know , very OOV resources , of course , but we do OOV to provide appropriate OOV OOV .
That is why I must thank the European Parliament for its initiative , both in a OOV OOV and on behalf of the Commission , because we should like to see more OOV , OOV or public , being taken in Europe at every level , on OOV that they go towards the OOV of OOV European heritage .
<P> OOV , this is why I am OOV in favour of the OOV we can give heritage aid by OOV OOV such as the OOV for OOV OOV by OOV OOV , or the European OOV OOV OOV .
What is the OOV of these OOV ?
OOV , they provide role OOV OOV all the citizens of Europe what it is possible to achieve , OOV with OOV resources , in terms of OOV this heritage we OOV for future OOV , a heritage which OOV to us OOV but also OOV , that is , the heritage of all OOV , OOV OOV cultural OOV .{"name": "ep-01-01-16.txt"}áÞOOV OOV OOV of the OOV of the OOV OOV <SPEAKER OOV NAME=" President " > The OOV of the OOV OOV have been OOV .
<P> OOV there any OOV ?
<P> ( The OOV were OOV ) OOV OOV OOV OOV <SPEAKER OOV NAME=" President " > The next OOV is the report by Mrs OOV OOV OOV ( OOV ) , on behalf of the Committee on OOV OOV , on the progress report of the Commission on the measures taken in the OOV of the OOV of the European Parliament in its OOV OOV resolution OOV ) OOV - OOV - OOV OOV .
<SPEAKER OOV OOV " OOV OOV OOV " > Mr President , there have been further OOV OOV the report on the OOV OOV .
That is a new OOV , but then again it OOV as no OOV , for this was a OOV case after all .
It was the first OOV after the OOV of the OOV Commission and OOV the first opportunity for this Parliament to have a say in the European Commission ' s OOV policy .
OOV then , Parliament has made its OOV OOV on a OOV basis , OOV in the excellent reports by Mr OOV OOV and Mr OOV OOV .
OOV to say , the OOV should help OOV OOV in Europe .
The question today is whether those OOV OOV , which were OOV at the time in order to OOV the OOV , have actually been made .
<P> OOV in all , it is OOV to say that the Commission has made every OOV to OOV the OOV of this Parliament .
A serious start has been made on OOV .
It is , of course , too OOV to OOV whether all the OOV results have been OOV ; too many words still need to be OOV into action for that to OOV .
OOV things can still go OOV , even at Commissioner level - and OOV the OOV Commission proposal on OOV to OOV is one of the things that OOV to OOV - it is quite clear that this Commission is OOV OOV to making a OOV with the OOV .
<P> I will give you a few OOV .
In its OOV resolution , this Parliament OOV an end to an OOV high OOV of OOV in OOV .
The Commission OOV OOV proposals to OOV the OOV OOV , and OOV a plan to OOV all OOV OOV by the end of OOV .
Parliament is OOV with OOV reports on this .
In OOV , Parliament OOV for a OOV of the rules on OOV and for OOV OOV ; the Commission OOV that this OOV was made .
Parliament OOV for OOV in the field of OOV for OOV aid ; OOV .
Parliament OOV a OOV of current OOV and OOV OOV ; again OOV .
Parliament OOV the Commission to OOV its OOV aid OOV ; OOV yet again .
Mr President , these are but a few OOV , but they do OOV that the European Parliament can OOV OOV results if it OOV a OOV OOV .
<P> OOV OOV of the OOV which this Parliament has every reason to be OOV , is that OOV the OOV in OOV .
In OOV , this OOV , which is OOV by the European Union , was OOV % OOV .
OOV to OOV and a OOV of OOV , this OOV still OOV OOV up OOV the end of last year , at the very time - we are OOV with the OOV from the OOV OOV - when there was a OOV OOV of OOV help in an area which very much needs it .
<P> In OOV OOV , this Parliament OOV out about this OOV state of OOV .
OOV that OOV , we OOV the Commission OOV , with no OOV , OOV we OOV had results .
OOV the OOV OOV three OOV OOV , more than OOV OOV OOV have already been OOV and more than OOV OOV OOV have been OOV there , which is good OOV in an area where OOV is an OOV OOV .
If this Parliament had not made it so clear that enough was enough , I am OOV that the OOV would still be OOV now .
OOV , the OOV is now having to OOV other problems , OOV it is OOV to make any OOV to this OOV OOV to the OOV of OOV , and even OOV services cannot get through the OOV OOV , but that is another OOV .
<P> I would like to take the opportunity to go into Mr OOV OOV ' s OOV very OOV .
I believe that , although it is an extremely OOV and OOV OOV , the OOV of which must be given OOV OOV , I cannot OOV OOV of it as rapporteur , because we have very OOV OOV new OOV in the OOV , so I hope that there will be some OOV for this .
<P> OOV to say , there are also areas of concern with regard to the OOV OOV .
For example , a OOV level of OOV must be OOV within the OOV policy with regard to OOV of OOV and the OOV OOV OOV .
I also OOV the Commissioner to OOV some OOV on how the Commission will OOV that each OOV Commissioner will ensure that OOV from the Court of OOV do not end up in some OOV OOV , but will be OOV with OOV OOV .
This Parliament will OOV the OOV of all reports OOV by the Commission .
The OOV OOV for the OOV years must be OOV into action , and I hope that we can do this together , and in OOV so , OOV OOV this OOV OOV and be able to work together on the future with OOV .
<SPEAKER OOV OOV " NAME=" OOV " > Mr President , the OOV OOV OOV report OOV a clear OOV of the measures which the European Commission has taken further to OOV made by Parliament in the OOV of the OOV OOV .
OOV that point of view , my group will support the report , and I would OOV Mrs OOV OOV OOV on OOV OOV .
<P> However , I would like to point out - and that is also mentioned in the report - that although some progress has been made in OOV areas , they have a long way to go yet .
This OOV to the OOV of OOV , OOV OOV management and OOV problems , the OOV OOV OOV and the OOV against OOV and OOV .
I will not go into all these areas but OOV a few .
<P> I believe it is of OOV importance for the Commission , in its OOV to OOV the OOV high OOV of OOV , to OOV the Member States which OOV to achieve any OOV in the OOV of OOV in the case of the OOV OOV OOV , for example .
The Member States will OOV not like this , but why could we not OOV a OOV for this , just as we do for the Member States ' OOV OOV in terms of OOV European legislation ?
The more OOV , the better .
OOV OOV OOV is that the national OOV can OOV their OOV to OOV .
In the OOV against OOV and the OOV OOV of European OOV , we must OOV far more on cooperation with national OOV .
The OOV of the OOV in the OOV that be , and OOV in the European Union , is at OOV .
It cannot be that we here in Europe get the OOV for the OOV and OOV of national OOV .
<P> In the OOV future , the Commission will need to OOV out all the OOV in order to set up an OOV management and OOV system .
We will OOV be OOV the new OOV OOV which , I hope , will better OOV the OOV of OOV management .
OOV , OOV and clear OOV are OOV OOV in this .
We must OOV a situation where different OOV responsible for OOV OOV and OOV , such as OOV and the financial OOV OOV , OOV each other out in their efforts .
There is OOV OOV than having OOV OOV OOV all their energy into OOV OOV OOV .
<P> Finally , we set great OOV by the Court of OOV OOV OOV the OOV reports to see how the Commission has OOV upon OOV OOV made OOV .
OOV without OOV back to OOV OOV OOV is a OOV OOV .
<SPEAKER OOV NAME=" OOV " > Mr President , I wish to thank Mrs OOV OOV OOV for OOV the Committee on OOV OOV and the European Parliament a OOV on which to OOV future OOV reports .
<P> OOV the OOV OOV was very clear that OOV OOV to OOV on a few areas where we OOV to see real OOV .
They were clearly set out last year .
OOV we have a OOV to OOV that those points have been OOV .
We shall be following OOV OOV in not OOV the amendments OOV because we want to OOV to that OOV approach .
<P> On the whole , the Commission has OOV OOV , and this now has to be set within the OOV of the more general Commission OOV .
We are OOV that the Commission will present OOV OOV reports for each OOV but , for that to work OOV , we need to know the OOV for these OOV very OOV .
OOV on OOV policy has also OOV OOV but things OOV to be OOV very OOV .
We OOV the OOV of negotiations on OOV issues but we and the European public will OOV OOV OOV if the OOV does not OOV OOV and the action start .
<P> The OOV and OOV OOV are the areas where most OOV problems OOV in the EU , OOV OOV to the OOV of the OOV OOV by these areas .
That is why it is OOV that we , as the OOV and OOV OOV , have OOV to information on the financial management of these two areas .
We look forward to OOV OOV reports from the OOV OOV Group .
<P> OOV aid , however , is an area where we still see OOV problems .
The rapporteur has OOV clearly to the OOV way the aid to OOV was OOV , which OOV a very OOV OOV at a time when the OOV political OOV and OOV were OOV in that region .
<P> OOV Court of OOV ' report on OOV aid has come out very OOV and we shall be OOV at that in the future .
OOV again , I thank the rapporteur and OOV OOV on a OOV well done .
<SPEAKER OOV OOV " OOV OOV " > Mr President , in OOV report , rapporteur Mrs OOV OOV OOV OOV at the progress which the Commission has made over the OOV year with regard to following OOV set out in the report on the OOV OOV .
OOV is rather OOV with the OOV of OOV which the Commission has OOV .
I am OOV for more OOV , for results .
The OOV are good , but the OOV will not be OOV OOV we see the results , once , for example , OOV is working OOV OOV , once the OOV in OOV has been OOV , once OOV OOV are made in OOV and once we OOV OOV OOV to OOV OOV .
<P> OOV , I am OOV by all the Commission ' s good OOV .
The OOV for OOV , much OOV by Mrs OOV OOV OOV , OOV a great deal to be OOV .
OOV of OOV and OOV , the OOV OOV an OOV of OOV OOV .
OOV to the new rules , OOV must OOV that they have OOV the OOV OOV .
OOV this not a case where the OOV of OOV should be OOV ?
We should OOV the Commission OOV that it OOV the OOV OOV .
<P> Mrs OOV OOV OOV OOV much OOV to the aid to the Palestinian regions and OOV an OOV OOV of OOV in the OOV of the European Union ' s OOV in the process .
I would like to see a report in which the role of our Palestinian OOV is OOV .
OOV , the recent OOV OOV us to OOV the conditions for European aid .
In this OOV , I would OOV OOV ' s attention to the fact that the OOV OOV in Palestinian OOV OOV many OOV OOV , which , in our countries , would OOV under the OOV of OOV to OOV OOV .
European aid must OOV peace .
That is why I have OOV an OOV in which I OOV the Commission not to support the OOV of OOV in OOV in any way .
There should be no question of European OOV being used to OOV for the OOV of OOV OOV .
I therefore OOV OOV my OOV , and hope it will OOV with OOV support .
A OOV OOV is not OOV OOV any good .
<SPEAKER OOV NAME=" OOV > , OOV of the Committee on OOV OOV .
( OOV ) Mr President , it is OOV that the OOV report on the OOV OOV to be OOV far more interest this time than the OOV itself , which was , in fact , OOV by the OOV Parliament .
I welcome this with open OOV , but there is OOV new in the fact that we have OOV such a report and are OOV to it , as we OOV to at the time .
OOV I believe we have done OOV to our OOV of OOV whether the Commission has OOV our OOV in OOV to the OOV .
<P> I am extremely OOV that the rapporteur has taken all these issues up again and would like to OOV OOV to this OOV .
However , I am also OOV to be able to OOV the Commission that it has OOV these OOV extremely well .
We are OOV conditions , and not just OOV .
However , there are still a few OOV to be OOV .
This is also clearly OOV out in the report , by the way .
I would OOV out the OOV of OOV for OOV OOV in this respect .
It is OOV OOV when we put in OOV of EUR OOV OOV to one OOV , which OOV the OOV and is then OOV for other OOV that the EU has set itself .
We must do more to OOV this than just OOV a report once every two years ; we need to OOV back .
Commissioner , this is a matter for you .
<P> OOV , I do not think much to the OOV of OOV up a second OOV for OOV OOV .
We have set up OOV and OOV to OOV far more on OOV that OOV is able to OOV out its work OOV and in an OOV OOV , particularly its OOV OOV .
I believe it is important for us to OOV the OOV that we OOV during the OOV process , OOV that of OOV a OOV OOV , which could be OOV to the Court of OOV or the Court of OOV .
I would OOV the Commission not just to issue OOV on this , but also OOV a legal basis .
<P> Finally , I would like to say a OOV thank you for the efforts made in respect of the OOV OOV .
I was there OOV .
I am OOV that after all these years , it has at long last OOV work and is OOV OOV the people well .
<SPEAKER OOV LANGUAGE="DE " NAME=" OOV " > Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , OOV me to OOV on OOV from where Mrs OOV OOV OOV .
Commissioner , we are actually OOV it quite OOV to OOV what the point would be of having an OOV OOV for financial OOV of the OOV you OOV .
The same OOV to the new OOV for OOV OOV OOV that the Commission is OOV to set up .
What OOV would this OOV and OOV actually OOV , when by the Commission ' s own OOV , OOV is responsible for all serious OOV of OOV against the interests of the Community , and not just for OOV OOV ?
I would OOV you once again that you , OOV , OOV that that is how it should be , yet you are OOV on the point of OOV some OOV of OOV OOV to form part of your proposals .
<P> Mrs OOV OOV OOV s report quite OOV OOV that the Commission has not yet made OOV progress on the OOV policy OOV for Parliament ' s OOV .
This particularly OOV to the already long OOV OOV of the OOV OOV .
OOV course , this has a great deal to do with the OOV OOV , because one OOV that also concerns us is the issue of the OOV of OOV in respect of OOV they OOV .
OOV Commission OOV have to OOV the costs of OOV they OOV , themselves , at least as far as their financial means OOV ?
In principle , the OOV to this question has long been OOV ' .
OOV , the OOV OOV of OOV OOV and OOV of the OOV OOV have OOV actually been OOV in a OOV case yet .
The OOV used was always that the OOV OOV were OOV .
OOV OOV that this will now change under the OOV process has been OOV so far .
It is this very issue , an OOV OOV one , that the OOV OOV on the OOV of the OOV OOV put forward by OOV OOV on OOV OOV , OOV , and it OOV a OOV OOV a OOV OOV .
OOV that if you will , because I find it OOV .
This House has OOV and clearly OOV this and OOV for an OOV OOV for OOV OOV to be OOV at the European Court of OOV or Court of OOV , which should be OOV in OOV the financial OOV of OOV is at issue .
<P> This OOV from the report by Mr OOV OOV on the OOV of the Commission has now been on the OOV since OOV last , and was OOV OOV in the OOV report on the OOV OOV .
I also believe that this OOV , the excellent report by Mrs OOV OOV OOV , OOV these issues , which are OOV to the OOV of EU OOV , OOV .
We have OOV the way , and now all we can do , Commissioner , is to OOV you to OOV it .
<SPEAKER OOV LANGUAGE="DE " NAME=" OOV " > Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , the fact that we are OOV the OOV measures to the OOV OOV OOV at the OOV of the year OOV , is , to my OOV , rather OOV in OOV terms , given that the OOV OOV OOV was OOV more than OOV OOV OOV and the OOV committee responsible is already working on the OOV for OOV .
A OOV , OOV OOV should OOV OOV to Parliament ' s OOV and OOV for OOV , particularly when OOV need to be OOV with .
<P> OOV now to OOV of OOV , OOV some welcome progress , the fact OOV that OOV OOV OOV by Parliament have not been OOV and are therefore to be OOV over into the OOV OOV for OOV years , which means that the clear OOV we OOV will become more OOV .
<P> There are two points in particular I would like to OOV .
I am at a OOV as to why the Commission has , as yet , OOV to take OOV to set up a OOV for OOV OOV at the Court of OOV or the Court of OOV , and so OOV the OOV OOV of the OOV of the OOV OOV OOV the financial OOV of OOV for OOV they OOV .
OOV many OOV do we have to ask , OOV , OOV - and I do not know what OOV - the Commission to get OOV to OOV something at long last ?
OOV this is a OOV OOV ?
The same OOV for our OOV that Parliament , as a OOV OOV , should be given at least the same OOV of OOV to the Commission as the Court of OOV .
OOV all , the OOV to provide information is clearly OOV , OOV OOV . it OOV from OOV OOV of the Treaty of OOV .
OOV , it also OOV to me that the OOV OOV , which was mentioned OOV , would be OOV to OOV , and I do not OOV to go into this matter any further at the present time since OOV OOV have already taken OOV of it .
However , both OOV are OOV in our amendments and I consider them OOV .
I would OOV your support in this .
<SPEAKER OOV LANGUAGE="FR" NAME=" OOV > Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , Mrs OOV OOV OOV .
I should like to OOV the rapporteur on this report , and to OOV my OOV OOV for the way in which OOV OOV the OOV , the OOV with which OOV OOV the matter , without OOV OOV OOV by the OOV which are always possible in the matter of OOV , as we have already OOV .
<P> I believe the OOV OOV is a very important one , which should be OOV with OOV , as the OOV OOV , and I think it is OOV for Parliament to look into the OOV OOV in the management of public OOV , of which there have been many in recent years , OOV OOV , it must be said , to the Member States .
This is a point to which we shall OOV when OOV other Court of OOV reports .
I think that Parliament must OOV especially on this OOV during this OOV of OOV .
<P> There were also OOV within the Commission .
OOV for OOV was a rather OOV case , OOV as it did with an extremely difficult time for the Commission .
I think the report , and the way it has been OOV , and the way I should like to see it OOV OOV without it OOV us to take another OOV OOV the OOV OOV , will OOV us to look to the future , taking as our OOV , to some OOV , this OOV which is the OOV of OOV OOV by Parliament and which has given OOV to certain OOV from the Commission .
<P> We have OOV these OOV , and have OOV the OOV of them OOV , as is OOV .
A new approach has now been adopted to ensure that OOV are OOV to the OOV of the OOV .
I think we are OOV in the right OOV and , in this OOV , we shall be OOV in favour of the OOV OOV OOV report .
<SPEAKER OOV LANGUAGE="DE " NAME=" OOV " > Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , Mrs OOV OOV OOV , the Commission OOV your report .
You have OOV that in most areas that were OOV to the OOV OOV OOV OOV the measures taken by the Commission OOV OOV because we are OOV in the right OOV .
I might therefore OOV , at the start of this new year , to take OOV in the fact that Parliament has OOV the Commission .
But I want to do more than just give OOV on the back , and OOV go on to look at the areas where you continue to OOV OOV or rather , OOV that further measures be taken , OOV in the OOV of OOV policy and OOV aid .
<P> As far as OOV policy is concerned , in your report you OOV OOV on the issue of the legal basis for the OOV OOV OOV .
I would again OOV attention to the fact that , before OOV , the Commission adopted a proposal that is now OOV the OOV OOV between the OOV and will be OOV to Parliament in OOV .
The OOV OOV are as OOV : it should be possible for OOV people to OOV in the OOV OOV OOV .
However , OOV to OOV OOV there are to be only OOV new OOV .
<P> OOV will OOV for the OOV ?
It is OOV on the OOV being at least OOV years of OOV and having been in OOV for at least OOV years .
The OOV also OOV OOV , OOV to a OOV ' s OOV and OOV OOV , for OOV % of their OOV to be OOV as OOV OOV OOV .
It is a OOV OOV .
OOV is there any legal OOV , OOV , the Commission , OOV OOV OOV , will OOV who is able to take up OOV OOV , OOV OOV that the OOV of the OOV , OOV OOV . an OOV increase in OOV on the OOV OOV , is actually OOV .
<P> The second OOV OOV to OOV policy concerns the OOV OOV .
In its OOV report , Parliament OOV that an OOV OOV for OOV OOV should be set up within the European Court of OOV or Court of OOV .
You have also mentioned this proposal again today .
I think I should just OOV through the OOV again - which my OOV OOV OOV has OOV in great OOV - as to why the Commission has OOV itself from this proposal .
The European OOV OOV specific OOV to the Court of OOV and to the European Court of OOV OOV .
The Court of OOV is responsible for the OOV OOV of OOV and it is the role of the Court of OOV to OOV the OOV OOV OOV by the Commission should the need OOV .
As the Commission OOV it , it would OOV to OOV of interest if the OOV were to be OOV involved in the Commission ' s OOV OOV .
The Commission would also point out that , in all international organisations , it is the OOV themselves that are responsible for OOV their OOV .
The Commission is OOV that the same should OOV here .
<P> OOV , there is a need for action .
That much is OOV having OOV the matter OOV .
We adopted the proposals that are now OOV the OOV OOV , and which Mr OOV mentioned , even before the end of the year .
OOV , we are OOV in terms of OOV that can be taken OOV , without OOV the OOV , and OOV , there are OOV that will OOV OOV of the OOV OOV , and will therefore take a OOV OOV to OOV .
As far as the first OOV are concerned , it is OOV OOV to set up an OOV and OOV OOV within the OOV for OOV and OOV .
<P> In OOV to your OOV , I can OOV you that the question is OOV OOV as to whether OOV is already involved in the OOV or OOV to become involved before this OOV OOV work .
OOV if OOV OOV this in the OOV will this OOV take action .
The OOV can OOV a great deal .
I would like to OOV an example : OOV OOV in the OOV .
OOV OOV may well not be OOV in to deal with such OOV , it would , of course , be necessary to OOV an OOV OOV or a OOV OOV .
So various areas come to OOV .
I think it is an excellent OOV to take a OOV approach .
We are not about to OOV OOV of its OOV , as it were , or OOV its OOV , which was OOV by Parliament and the Council , because OOV OOV take OOV here , and that is a fact .
<P> OOV , it is very important for the OOV OOV to be OOV by an OOV OOV .
This would OOV that the Commission is OOV to OOV OOV and OOV OOV OOV .
<P> I have just a few more words to say about your OOV OOV on OOV policy .
Mrs OOV mentioned the need to OOV OOV OOV .
We OOV a report on this as part of the OOV OOV OOV and made it clear that , of course , these OOV OOV , which have long been OOV as OOV OOV , must be OOV as OOV as possible .
OOV , the field of OOV aid is already OOV the first positive OOV in this respect .
<P> OOV now to the matter of the OOV in OOV , which OOV a OOV part in the report by Mrs OOV OOV OOV .
There were certainly a great many OOV OOV .
OOV , there were OOV and OOV OOV from within this House for progress to be made and for something to be done about all the problems .
OOV , it is most OOV that the OOV is now fully up and OOV and that it has been OOV OOV since the OOV .
OOV OOV I would say OOV , is that OOV on the political OOV , OOV OOV . the OOV OOV , have OOV up OOV again .
It is even the case OOV that , OOV to the OOV in the OOV OOV , OOV cannot be OOV and OOV cannot get there .
OOV OOV of OOV are OOV to OOV the OOV at the OOV .
We really must - also within the OOV of this debate - make OOV OOV for the OOV to end .
The European OOV OOV was OOV to OOV aid to the people of OOV .
It is high time the people were able to make use of it .
<SPEAKER OOV NAME=" President " > OOV OOV , Commissioner .
<P> The debate is OOV .
<P> The vote will take place today at OOV OOV .
OOV OOV OOV reports of the Court of OOV <SPEAKER OOV NAME=" President " > The next OOV is the OOV debate on the following reports : <P> ( OOV ) by Mr OOV OOV , on behalf of the Committee on OOV OOV , on the Court of OOV ' OOV OOV No OOV on OOV and OOV OOV for in the Community OOV OOV to OOV the OOV of OOV own resources , together with the Commission ' s OOV OOV - OOV ; <P> ( OOV ) by Mr OOV , Committee on OOV OOV , on the European Court of OOV ' OOV OOV OOV OOV OOV the aid for the use of OOV and OOV OOV as OOV OOV , OOV on the OOV of the OOV OOV in the OOV sector , OOV on OOV OOV OOV and OOV on the Community measures for the OOV of OOV , together with the Commission ' s OOV OOV , OOV , OOV , OOV - OOV ; <P> ( OOV ) by Mr OOV , Committee on OOV OOV , on the Court of OOV ' OOV OOV No OOV on aid given by the European Union to OOV and OOV with a view to OOV peace and the OOV of law , together with the Commission 's OOV OOV - OOV ; <P> ( OOV ) by Mr OOV , Committee on OOV OOV , on the Court of OOV ' OOV OOV OOV OOV , OOV , OOV and OOV on OOV implementation of the OOV OOV , together with the Commission 's OOV OOV , OOV , OOV , OOV - OOV .
<SPEAKER OOV LANGUAGE="ES " NAME=" OOV OOV " > , OOV for the rapporteur .
( OOV ) Mr President , I should like to OOV by OOV the OOV work done by my OOV , OOV OOV OOV , in the report he is OOV on own resources , a subject he has been following very OOV for some time .
<P> The Community OOV OOV , in part , from the OOV own resources OOV by the Member States ' OOV services and therefore the OOV role of Community legislation on OOV and OOV is to OOV the financial interests of the Community .
<P> The OOV in the OOV OOV to the security and OOV system OOV OOV that the OOV Community OOV is not OOV and has to be OOV by OOV OOV OOV from the Member States .
OOV , I OOV that interest should be OOV on OOV who OOV use OOV OOV in their OOV OOV as part of OOV for OOV OOV OOV .
The OOV OOV report OOV with OOV under Member State responsibility in which a OOV to OOV Community legislation on OOV and OOV OOV the Community ' s interests .
<P> OOV to the Court of OOV , in OOV of OOV OOV the OOV principle is that the OOV authorities should OOV the security at a level OOV to the OOV OOV of the OOV OOV where this can be OOV with OOV , or if not , the OOV OOV , as OOV by the OOV authorities , of the OOV OOV which have been , or may be , OOV .
In OOV , it is the security or OOV OOV that OOV the OOV of the OOV .
In order for these OOV to be OOV , the OOV should be OOV at the OOV possible level to the OOV OOV for which the security or OOV is OOV .
If these rules were OOV , the OOV financial interests would be fully OOV .
<P> A number of OOV OOV in this and I shall OOV OOV a OOV : <P> OOV of all , there are no OOV OOV on the OOV of OOV OOV OOV .
The OOV on these OOV and OOV , which are clearly OOV in OOV and legal terms , certainly OOV in the OOV OOV OOV of Member States , but there are no OOV to OOV it to be OOV and OOV at Community level .
<P> OOV , some OOV authorities cannot - I OOV to think this rather than that they do not OOV - OOV OOV OOV of the OOV set out in Community legislation on OOV because of OOV in their OOV OOV or OOV systems and OOV .
I must OOV the need for the OOV OOV OOV OOV OOV ) to come into OOV OOV in all the Member States and the countries OOV with the common OOV system .
It is clear that the OOV of Community OOV will OOV , to a OOV OOV , on the development of all the OOV of the OOV
<P> OOV OOV the problem of the high level of OOV OOV OOV , we should OOV the importance of OOV measures and , again , the need for OOV development of this new system .
OOV the OOV OOV OOV system and the OOV we shall achieve OOV and greater OOV OOV .
<P> OOV , OOV OOV must be mentioned .
At the end of the OOV OOV under Community rules the Member States should OOV the OOV OOV by a OOV which are not OOV into ' A ' OOV .
<P> OOV , the need for a change to Community OOV legislation in order to ensure that the OOV which OOV the right to OOV should also OOV the OOV OOV made by the OOV OOV after OOV of OOV .
<P> OOV , the OOV number of OOV OOV by the Court of OOV in which the OOV OOV to the Community OOV have not been OOV or OOV with the OOV OOV OOV interest .
<P> OOV , I should like to OOV the OOV OOV OOV to the OOV to OOV the OOV OOV of OOV OOV and other OOV OOV from OOV OOV , which are OOV to OOV implementation of OOV OOV and a OOV of OOV of OOV OOV .
<P> OOV OOV , Mr President , I want to OOV that the Commission must OOV the various problems OOV and , in particular , OOV the OOV system in order to take into account the interest OOV in this respect to the Community OOV by the Member States .
<SPEAKER OOV OOV " > Mr President , I want to OOV the important role of the Court of OOV in OOV these reports .
I am OOV with OOV reports OOV to the OOV sector , the OOV sector and OOV OOV OOV OOV OOV of OOV EUR OOV OOV , which is a OOV OOV of the OOV .
The OOV by the Court of OOV OOV a great deal of OOV and we must OOV the important role it OOV in OOV Parliament in its work , because , OOV , without this OOV between the Court of OOV and Parliament , Parliament would be in no position to OOV or OOV the OOV of Commission OOV .
We can also OOV that the Court of OOV OOV a role in OOV the Commission to OOV OOV in its OOV and OOV which it may not have OOV in the way Member States OOV our various OOV .
<P> The Court of OOV , in this particular report , has OOV attention to the OOV in the OOV OOV , OOV which make it difficult for the Commission and indeed even the Member States to OOV OOV OOV .
In the OOV report on the OOV of the OOV sector , the Court of OOV has OOV attention to the question of whether or not the policy itself OOV its economic and social OOV .
<P> OOV go back to the OOV sector - there are two reports here , one OOV to OOV OOV , the other to OOV - we should OOV that even OOV we have a OOV system which is OOV to OOV OOV OOV to the level of OOV , we still have to OOV OOV EUR OOV OOV million a year OOV of OOV , and of the OOV OOV which we OOV something like only OOV % of it is OOV at market OOV .
In other words , the OOV of it must be OOV for use in OOV OOV and other things .
OOV , in the case of OOV , only OOV % of the OOV we OOV is OOV at market OOV .
This OOV the OOV in the OOV where we have a OOV system and at the same time OOV OOV Community resources to OOV OOV .
<P> The Court of OOV ' report - and Parliament OOV this - OOV attention to the fact that we should OOV OOV our resources better in a way that might OOV greater OOV of OOV OOV on our European OOV , rather than OOV OOV OOV .
<P> In the OOV sector , the main concern of the Court of OOV was the fact of OOV which has been well OOV and which we OOV , and it also OOV attention to the fact that it is necessary in OOV policy at all OOV - Commission , Council and Parliament - to take account of market OOV .
OOV we OOV this policy we did not OOV the OOV in world OOV which OOV to OOV OOV in the sector .
The report also OOV attention to the fact , and Parliament OOV this , that something like OOV % of all the EUR OOV OOV OOV in the OOV sector OOV to OOV % of farmers , and OOV % of farmers only get OOV OOV % of the aid .
<P> This again OOV attention to the whole OOV of the policy and whether or not we should OOV it with the OOV of making it more OOV with regional policy and with social policy .
These were the main concerns OOV .
We should also say in OOV to the OOV sector or to the OOV sector that we have OOV that the Commission has OOV a OOV and OOV OOV of the policy and has already set that OOV in OOV .
So we look forward to its OOV .
<P> I want to thank the Commission for its cooperation and the fact that it has already taken action on some of the OOV OOV in the various reports .
<SPEAKER OOV OOV " NAME=" OOV " > Mr President , since the end of OOV OOV , when the OOV peace OOV were OOV , the European Union has OOV to peace in a major way .
A great deal of OOV has been OOV up for OOV , the OOV of OOV , OOV to human rights , OOV .
We also OOV OOV % of the OOV OOV OOV .
The Court of OOV ' OOV OOV which is before us , is the third in a OOV .
There have already been reports on the situation in OOV , and a second report OOV with the OOV in OOV OOV .
I believe that these OOV reports , together with the report which is now before us , have OOV made us as a European Parliament OOV up and OOV the OOV , and also OOV to OOV upon these reports in an OOV OOV .
I also believe that progress has been made in this area OOV to the Court of OOV ' way of working , together with the OOV by Parliament , OOV the Committee on OOV OOV .
<P> OOV and gentlemen , the OOV of OOV OOV cannot be OOV out from a OOV OOV in OOV or an OOV in OOV .
I believe that OOV , it is necessary to OOV the OOV OOV .
OOV in the field is necessary ; you need to OOV the people ; you need to know what people have to put up with there , what the conditions are .
For OOV reports , other OOV have been given the opportunity of going to OOV and OOV .
They OOV a OOV from their OOV , and I OOV the place OOV between OOV and OOV OOV of last year .
That is very important .
I would like to OOV as well as OOV this .
In OOV fact , I OOV more in those OOV OOV in OOV than I could have OOV from OOV through OOV and OOV of OOV OOV .
I would therefore like to OOV the OOV of OOV to take this into OOV when , at a OOV OOV , they OOV for or against OOV OOV the opportunity to have this OOV .
<P> What was the OOV about , ladies and gentlemen ?
OOV of all , OOV was OOV at the Commission for not OOV OOV resources and OOV and for a OOV management which is too OOV .
I OOV that this OOV by the Court of OOV has been OOV upon by the European Commission .
OOV OOV to the Commission for this .
OOV have been made and OOV OOV have OOV .
I would like to OOV here that the people in the OOV in OOV are better OOV , OOV OOV and OOV OOV .
That is OOV to the Court of OOV ' OOV and the fact that Parliament has OOV upon this OOV .
OOV , the Commission has , under OOV from the Court of OOV , adopted a OOV policy , which has given the people in the OOV OOV , but also in other OOV , more OOV .
It has also OOV that the OOV of the OOV can OOV the needs on the OOV in a more OOV OOV , and has also OOV that all OOV OOV have now been OOV .
So , as far as this is concerned , well done to the Commission .
<P> OOV OOV concerned the OOV OOV ' s OOV and how the European Union OOV with that OOV .
The European Commission has been OOV for not OOV a OOV enough OOV on it .
OOV to the Court of OOV ' report and the action taken by Parliament , there is now a new OOV in the OOV of the OOV OOV .
It is indeed the case that , since OOV OOV , there has been a new financial OOV who has OOV a OOV OOV on the rules to be OOV .
OOV , when the OOV OOV first OOV up OOV , rather a OOV was being OOV .
OOV OOV , and that of the Commission and the OOV as a whole , has OOV down the OOV of the OOV OOV ' s OOV by OOV EUR OOV million over a OOV of three years .
I believe that this is an extremely positive result .
<P> OOV , one of the OOV OOV OOV at the OOV OOV was also in the OOV of OOV OOV on the conflict of interests OOV by the OOV financial OOV .
Parliament , at least in the resolution now before us , is OOV for a full OOV in this regard .
I have to OOV you know that I have now OOV a OOV from the OOV OOV , and from the Commission , and that the OOV OOV have been OOV in this OOV .
That is why I OOV the OOV of my OOV , which OOV this into account .
<P> OOV OOV was OOV with regard to human rights .
I have to say that the Commission is OOV a OOV OOV OOV on this in OOV and OOV and OOV in general .
I believe we should make more funds available to those people , but in terms of human rights , we are still OOV for OOV from the Commission with regard to OOV OOV and OOV .
<P> A OOV - important - point I would like to make is the OOV OOV of the OOV policy .
The Commission has come under very OOV OOV with regard to its OOV policy .
It is OOV that with regard to this policy , EUR OOV million ' s OOV of OOV was OOV which was not OOV for OOV .
I am still OOV for a OOV report from the Commission .
It is OOV in the resolution , and so I hope that a OOV will be OOV in the very OOV future .
<SPEAKER OOV LANGUAGE="FR" NAME=" OOV > Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , my report is really a OOV of OOV OOV reports .
OOV this point of view I should like to thank Commissioner OOV for OOV .
I hope that , through OOV , the OOV responsible more OOV for the OOV of the OOV OOV , both in the Commission and in the Member States , will be made aware of the OOV of our report and of our OOV , since this matter concerns the OOV OOV , which , as we know , are OOV OOV by the Member States OOV .
<P> So , to the OOV OOV reports : one report on the principle of OOV , one report on the development of OOV OOV , a third report from the Court of OOV on the European OOV OOV and the European OOV OOV and OOV OOV ( OOV OOV ) - OOV to OOV the employment of young OOV , and a OOV report on the OOV OOV for OOV and the OOV OOV OOV for OOV and OOV .
OOV this last report , I should particularly like to thank the Committee on OOV OOV , OOV and OOV for its contribution .
OOV Committee OOV on OOV all the amendments they OOV .
<P> OOV these OOV OOV are quite OOV , the same OOV of OOV can be made about them all , and these are of three OOV .
OOV , the major OOV which may be OOV at the Commission with regard to the OOV OOV which the Court of OOV , like us , OOV too OOV and too OOV and which OOV OOV the OOV OOV of OOV .
It must be said that the same OOV are also made of Member States .
There is OOV OOV OOV once OOV are OOV , OOV at OOV OOV or from OOV .
The same OOV of resources and OOV is OOV OOV upon - other OOV have OOV it on other points - even OOV the OOV OOV by the Court of OOV on the subject .
<P> The Commission is OOV OOV in a OOV OOV of its OOV and is OOV for OOV resources .
I hope that Parliament , which has always OOV in the OOV of the OOV OOV of OOV OOV the OOV in their OOV , will OOV the Commission ' s proposals and OOV and will also OOV up its OOV OOV and its role .
OOV , this will OOV some OOV of OOV , since OOV is not OOV well OOV , and OOV the OOV use of European OOV .
The OOV OOV that may be made concerns the OOV in OOV , a OOV problem which the Commission does not OOV to be OOV of OOV or OOV a OOV to .
<P> OOV , a major OOV that I would like us to OOV in our OOV with the Member States is the OOV use of OOV , often OOV to a OOV of cooperation between the Member States and the Commission , and the OOV of the Member States to make better use of the funds .
OOV often they are OOV as OOV , funds to be OOV for national funds .
In some OOV , the Member States OOV OOV importance to the principle of OOV which OOV that this is OOV which must be OOV by national OOV .
They OOV to think the funds OOV OOV % of the OOV , which is clearly not in OOV with the OOV OOV the OOV OOV and their use .
The Member States should not OOV that these are public funds and , as such , the concern of all the citizens of Europe .
They should OOV be used with even more OOV than national funds .
<P> In order to OOV such OOV , a new OOV was adopted in OOV OOV , which I hope will OOV us to make progress .
OOV it OOV OOV we would OOV the Commission to use all the means available to it , such as the OOV of OOV , and if there is OOV OOV we shall be right OOV the Commission in this .
<P> Finally , I think the Commission itself should OOV more attention to the OOV OOV before OOV funds to be OOV .
This would OOV the OOV of OOV that were not OOV and the OOV ' OOV that are often OOV in the Member States .
That OOV my OOV .
OOV you , Mr President , for the OOV few OOV you OOV me .
<SPEAKER OOV OOV " NAME=" OOV " > Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , the fact that the European Union is making OOV resources available for the OOV of democracy in OOV and OOV and for its OOV fully OOV the OOV with which we are now OOV the OOV for a resolution on OOV OOV No OOV of the Court of OOV .
<P> I say this because it was only at the OOV of 2000 that the Court was able to OOV and OOV its report on Community aid OOV between OOV and OOV , in other words , between OOV and two years OOV .
The OOV OOV of this OOV OOV is that many of the OOV in the report are out of OOV , since , in the OOV , major OOV have taken place in the legal framework and the political situation in OOV and OOV .
But this does not OOV that the report ' s OOV should not be taken into account in future , particularly in OOV , in order to OOV OOV problems OOV with OOV OOV OOV by the Union .
<P> This OOV of OOV is OOV for OOV and OOV OOV problems , which OOV on two OOV : one OOV OOV OOV and the other OOV with other OOV .
In the first case , one problem that OOV out is the OOV of support for OOV OOV to OOV human rights , support for civil society and support for the OOV .
There have been many OOV which , OOV , have been OOV .
These OOV from OOV of OOV OOV OOV given the OOV with which OOV have to be OOV out , to the fact that the Commission OOV itself OOV with various OOV OOV which OOV had to be OOV .
OOV regard to OOV , we welcome the OOV of OOV from the OOV of the OOV OOV to the first OOV , which OOV that it had to be OOV in OOV with the OOV of the OOV OOV .
OOV , we believe the same will have to OOV to OOV for OOV OOV OOV and , OOV , to cooperation with the OOV
<P> OOV OOV , Mr President , these were the OOV that we in the Committee on OOV OOV , OOV Rights , OOV OOV and OOV OOV OOV should be OOV in the report by Mr OOV - OOV I OOV - given the OOV of the OOV OOV for this OOV of aid , the OOV of resources and the OOV need for them to be used in a OOV and OOV way .
<SPEAKER OOV NAME=" OOV " > Mr President , I wish to OOV by OOV Mr OOV 's report and its OOV that the OOV OOV for OOV and the OOV and OOV OOV are an OOV means of OOV the peace process .
<P> The difficult environment in which the OOV have had to OOV , their role as a OOV OOV , the approach in OOV priority to OOV areas and the OOV role in OOV the OOV management and OOV of OOV programmes have all been given the OOV they OOV .
<P> I OOV that the OOV OOV for OOV has OOV a OOV OOV to the issues OOV in the Court of OOV ' report , which can be made available to Members .
That OOV OOV a number of specific OOV that the OOV is taking to OOV OOV OOV in the report .
<P> It is important to OOV one OOV point in OOV to the OOV OOV for OOV : this is not a European Union programme .
The OOV is , in fact , an international OOV with its own OOV OOV , rules , OOV OOV and so on .
OOV , the European Union is just one of OOV OOV involved in its OOV .
The European Union 's OOV contribution OOV OOV % of the OOV .
<P> The OOV OOV for OOV was OOV by the OOV and OOV OOV in OOV with the OOV of OOV economic and social OOV and OOV OOV , OOV and OOV between the OOV and OOV OOV OOV .
<P> OOV to the OOV are the United States , the European Union , OOV , OOV OOV and OOV .
OOV the OOV was set up it has OOV OOV of EUR OOV million to OOV OOV OOV , which have OOV to OOV OOV OOV OOV , OOV to an OOV OOV of OOV EUR OOV OOV , OOV the OOV OOV in these OOV to OOV EUR OOV OOV ; OOV OOV OOV % of its OOV to the most OOV areas ; OOV over OOV OOV OOV in OOV OOV and OOV OOV OOV OOV in OOV OOV .
<SPEAKER OOV OOV NAME=" OOV " > Mr President , may I say that Mr OOV has done an excellent OOV in his report .
OOV I also point out to OOV that the OOV are a OOV area of Europe , both OOV and from the point of view of their OOV and their way of OOV .
So we need to OOV every OOV from every possible OOV if we are to be OOV both in our OOV and in the measures which we take .
What it OOV down to , as Mr OOV has said and done , is going and OOV for OOV .
OOV where we OOV , we cannot see what is OOV in these particular regions , which are OOV much a law OOV themselves .
We cannot OOV what is going on from OOV a OOV .
We cannot OOV the OOV way of OOV from OOV , OOV and OOV .
What we need to do is to get OOV to them , and we need to get OOV to them not just by OOV an interest which , it OOV without OOV , is OOV on all OOV ; we need to get OOV to them in OOV , both OOV and OOV , but OOV by OOV about their OOV and what OOV them OOV .
<P> OOV that has OOV , the OOV made by the OOV and the Commission , OOV that something that is good can always be OOV by something that is better and that something that is better can always be made better still .
That is the OOV we are all OOV in .
I am certain that the interest OOV by us and the OOV OOV which OOV cannot but OOV in the right OOV and , if you like , we can take the results of the OOV OOV to this OOV of OOV and OOV them in other OOV .
The European OOV for OOV is now up and OOV in OOV and OOV .
It has OOV a great deal of OOV , but we cannot OOV that OOV is the same OOV as OOV and we need to make that clear , which is OOV why I OOV to different OOV of OOV , OOV and OOV which need to be OOV in OOV .
<P> OOV OOV Members - and to some OOV they are right - said that the OOV in OOV should be OOV and should OOV to OOV .
OOV of us OOV OOV this as out of the question .
We have been OOV right in OOV the OOV in OOV because if we had OOV the OOV OOV to OOV , OOV would now be OOV to OOV OOV from the European OOV for OOV because it would have been OOV for a OOV to go to OOV and OOV so much as a OOV OOV .
OOV is why I OOV that OOV is a good OOV , but OOV we do must be OOV to the OOV , the needs and the OOV of each region .
<SPEAKER OOV NAME=" OOV " > Mr President , I would like to start by OOV my OOV to the Court of OOV for its very OOV report this time on a OOV of issues .
We were very OOV of it at the time of the OOV report but I think these OOV reports are very OOV .
<P> There are clearly a OOV of areas where the Commission has yet to OOV to improve OOV .
OOV , I am going to OOV on a OOV to the report OOV by Mr OOV on various OOV of the OOV OOV .
OOV , in my country , this is one of the areas where the European Union can OOV OOV to be making a OOV , and there is a OOV that OOV OOV and the OOV to increase OOV , and improve social conditions and employment OOV in an area give a positive OOV of the OOV
But we cannot OOV by and OOV OOV .
The reports by the Court of OOV clearly OOV that there is OOV for OOV OOV , and the Commission has already OOV a new OOV OOV OOV to improve the situation and will OOV be OOV very OOV to see whether these OOV have OOV far enough .
<P> In the case of OOV , we must OOV that European OOV are OOV not to OOV but to OOV OOV and must not take the place of public OOV by national authorities .
That is all very well , but even the new OOV only OOV for OOV of OOV at a national level and not at a regional level .
OOV are rules , but if there is no OOV OOV after OOV them , they become OOV and OOV , so we need to see a OOV legal basis to OOV the possible OOV of OOV .
<P> On the issue of the development of OOV OOV , the Commission should not OOV its OOV but say that this should only be OOV as part of a OOV policy to OOV OOV .
OOV OOV go into these OOV .
In OOV , for example , we know that this is a clear OOV ; we need clear OOV and OOV and we will be OOV forward to OOV those within the OOV OOV programmes in future .
<SPEAKER OOV OOV " NAME=" OOV " > Mr President , I would like , in OOV time , to take you through a number of OOV which concern the Court of OOV ' reports which were , indeed , OOV .
<P> OOV of all , there is the OOV report .
I believe the Committee on OOV has already made OOV to this OOV , but I think it is OOV that we OOV the results of the committee of OOV on OOV OOV .
What has the Commission done so far with the OOV in that report ?
<P> OOV , there is the OOV report on OOV .
It is always an OOV OOV , and OOV will OOV that the agricultural policy is not OOV , but that it should OOV OOV with the OOV , especially in OOV with the negotiations within the OOV OOV OOV and enlargement .
<P> I would also like to OOV two points without making a OOV OOV for or against .
The following OOV are OOV of importance to my group : first , what would the OOV of OOV agricultural OOV be , and OOV OOV , in particular ?
OOV point , which is very OOV at the OOV , is OOV OOV OOV .
This is taking a OOV OOV out of the European OOV .
OOV it not be possible , in OOV of OOV in the Member States , to OOV OOV OOV against the OOV of certain OOV OOV ?
OOV the Commission look into this matter at the OOV opportunity ?
<P> OOV to the OOV report , it is OOV to see that the European Union can make a OOV in the OOV , which is much like a OOV ' s OOV .
We are OOV about this , and we believe the OOV report is excellent .
We particularly support the fact that it is not the OOV of the OOV OOV which is OOV the OOV ; it is the European Union which OOV up the funds and which will have to OOV whether these are well OOV .
<P> I would like to make a general OOV on the OOV of OOV which is OOV to OOV in the OOV .
In our opinion , it is necessary for the Commission to OOV on the way in which this should be OOV to OOV Europe .
OOV this having an OOV on European aid ? <P> Finally , I would like to make an OOV with regard to the OOV report .
In my country , there are OOV that the OOV of OOV OOV is OOV OOV OOV to European aid .
This is not OOV in our OOV .
OOV something be done about this ? <SPEAKER OOV LANGUAGE="DE " NAME=" OOV " > Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , the reports from the Court of OOV have been given a whole new OOV by the current OOV OOV .
The European agricultural policy must be given a OOV going over .
OOV is only the OOV of the OOV .
OOV of OOV OOV , OOV and then more OOV for OOV OOV , not only is all this very difficult for the OOV OOV to OOV , it is also extremely OOV to OOV , and the OOV OOV cannot OOV to OOV the OOV .
This is very clearly OOV out by the OOV report .
<P> It is to the rapporteur ' s OOV that he OOV OOV attention to this , and not just in OOV such as these .
OOV , Parliament does not have full OOV OOV in agricultural OOV and is therefore only able to make very OOV use of the political OOV for OOV .
The decisions are taken in the Council of OOV ; they are OOV OOV OOV OOV by the national OOV OOV , with their OOV OOV interests .
OOV OOV they OOV the right to make the decisions , they are not OOV to actually take on responsibility .
OOV it OOV to OOV , OOV , OOV or OOV , they are not the OOV who OOV take responsibility ; no , they always point the OOV at OOV , OOV OOV . the EU OOV .
<P> There has to be a OOV change on this OOV .
OOV only is OOV OOV for , but also political OOV for Parliament in all areas of the agricultural policy .
We need more OOV and OOV .
This is not about working against the farmers ; it is about OOV for a different OOV of OOV policy , in the interests of the farmers .
Mr OOV has already mentioned the right OOV words in his report .
What we are OOV about here is the issue of OOV aid and OOV .
OOV needs to change here , also in the OOV of OOV enlargement , if we want to OOV the agricultural policy in such a way that it will OOV itself to OOV enlargement .
OOV after the OOV OOV , it is clear that the Council is OOV of actually OOV these problems , and so to OOV , I would like to OOV once again , and this will be a matter of concern to the whole of Parliament , that Parliament needs full OOV and OOV rights in agricultural policy .
<SPEAKER OOV OOV NAME=" OOV " > Mr President , in the report of the Court of OOV for OOV we can OOV that OOV OOV , OOV and OOV have been OOV OOV OOV into the EU OOV .
These three countries have OOV account in the OOV of their OOV OOV , OOV OOV . own resources , to a much greater OOV OOV than other countries .
There are OOV OOV in these countries and a OOV of OOV in OOV OOV through them .
<P> OOV the OOV of the Court of OOV and Mr OOV OOV ' s report OOV an OOV OOV .
In many countries OOV have been OOV , although there is no OOV of countries ' OOV .
This OOV OOV OOV to the OOV that OOV are OOV OOV in those countries that have OOV OOV OOV .
If there is no OOV of countries ' OOV , OOV must OOV on OOV OOV , OOV and OOV .
If they are not OOV of OOV up OOV and OOV OOV , they are , OOV , the OOV of OOV , as the countries ' OOV are not mentioned .
<P> OOV OOV of OOV OOV through the European Union , which are then OOV OOV the Union from its OOV .
OOV by both the Court of OOV and OOV have OOV that there is major OOV OOV with OOV OOV and OOV OOV in particular .
It is difficult to OOV the OOV of this , but the OOV of the OOV OOV to the Union is OOV to be between one and OOV OOV OOV .
OOV OOV OOV into the OOV and OOV OOV and is OOV on through EU countries , often to the area of the OOV OOV , to OOV , for example .
OOV year the EU OOV to OOV financial aid to OOV to the OOV of EUR OOV million for political OOV , OOV of any conditions OOV with the OOV of OOV .
OOV OOV OOV OOV is taken by OOV or OOV OOV from OOV to OOV from where it is OOV to EU OOV OOV of OOV OOV or OOV .
OOV OOV this OOV of OOV from OOV , we need OOV OOV and OOV to the problems Mr OOV OOV OOV to in his report .
OOV the Union ' s point of view , we are OOV about a OOV OOV OOV of OOV .
<SPEAKER OOV LANGUAGE="FR" NAME=" OOV " > Mr President , today ' s debate is certainly a welcome one , but it OOV some very different OOV .
I shall therefore OOV my OOV to the OOV OOV by Mr OOV and Mr OOV .
<P> OOV the first of these reports , the OOV Members of our group cannot OOV its OOV on OOV , which OOV the Council decision to OOV OOV OOV OOV OOV .
<P> This is a decision we think is particularly OOV , and one that is OOV for farmers .
OOV , we do not think that the fact that OOV % of OOV available in OOV under the OOV OOV OOV for OOV organisations " was OOV in just three Member States , OOV of which is OOV the OOV in the European Union , as the resolution points out , is OOV including as a serious OOV .
It is rather OOV the OOV to OOV that the OOV of the development of a OOV world and the OOV of certain social OOV in our countries is a OOV OOV , and the OOV to still OOV OOV is not about to make it possible to OOV OOV that sector of the OOV which has often been OOV for a long OOV .
<P> We do not find the report ' s OOV OOV to the aid given to the major OOV regions to be OOV OOV , even OOV the report does , OOV , OOV OOV attention to the OOV OOV within the European Union .
<P> We do not OOV the report ' s opinion , on the subject of OOV OOV , that OOV farmers should OOV the greater part of the financial OOV involved in OOV OOV .
OOV might well ask just why they should be OOV to OOV these OOV costs when they are OOV down by OOV costs already .
<P> They are clearly not the parties responsible for OOV OOV ; they are its OOV .
So , OOV we are OOV , once again , to OOV the common agricultural policy on the OOV , there could be no question of OOV this proposal .
<P> Mr OOV ' report on European Union aid to OOV and OOV OOV OOV the serious financial OOV in the OOV of the OOV OOV ( OOV ) during a OOV OOV , what is more , and once again , at the OOV of OOV OOV to the citizens of Europe .
<P> OOV group also OOV the OOV for the OOV and the Commission to provide information OOV the OOV OOV to this OOV of interests .
<P> OOV is it OOV for EUR OOV million to be OOV to OOV OOV in the sector of OOV <P> ( The President OOV the OOV OOV ) <SPEAKER OOV LANGUAGE="DE " NAME=" OOV " > Mr President , I would like to say a few words OOV the excellent report by Mr OOV .
OOV , I would , however , like to OOV my OOV at you , as a OOV of the OOV of Parliament .
It was a OOV to this House that we had to OOV such a OOV OOV OOV over the question as to whether or not we can OOV the rapporteur of Parliament 's Committee on OOV OOV to OOV and OOV .
I hope that for the OOV of those OOV we are OOV to OOV here , there will be no OOV OOV .
I make no OOV about the fact , because this is something we - OOV OOV - OOV OOV the Commission for .
This time , I am OOV to say , we are OOV to OOV that the problem OOV with us , which is OOV .
<P> OOV , this report by Mr OOV OOV our OOV in two OOV .
OOV , the Commission is OOV to new OOV .
A most welcome development has taken place between the first OOV under the OOV of the Committee on OOV and the Committee on OOV OOV , and the OOV OOV as OOV by our rapporteur , and I can only OOV the Commission on this .
<P> At the start of this programme for the OOV , aid was OOV in the OOV EU OOV , OOV OOV . the decision was taken OOV the OOV OOV in OOV and OOV OOV were then OOV to OOV the aid OOV at local level , and to OOV and OOV the funds .
This OOV has been OOV and the system OOV OOV - OOV under OOV from this House .
It OOV that our OOV are OOV and that the Commission is OOV to new OOV .
<P> Commissioner , OOV you could even use this OOV to new OOV , which you OOV in the OOV in OOV , as an example for other OOV in other countries to OOV .
<SPEAKER OOV LANGUAGE="ES " NAME=" OOV OOV > Mr President , OOV the resources that the OOV OOV have been OOV for years to OOV OOV OOV in the European Union , the OOV OOV regions still have a OOV OOV OOV two and a OOV OOV OOV than the OOV , and OOV the many needs put forward by these OOV regions , not all the OOV OOV as development funds are actually used each year .
I believe we should think about the real OOV OOV this OOV fact .
OOV there is a OOV of OOV and the OOV areas do not know how to OOV .
<P> If that is the case , we should not just OOV our OOV and OOV our OOV with the OOV that we give them OOV but they do not use it OOV .
We should OOV forward with an OOV policy of OOV , information , OOV , OOV , OOV and OOV to give a OOV to new OOV and OOV for development and progress .
<P> But it is also possible that what is OOV is that from our more OOV and more OOV OOV we are being too OOV and OOV , OOV too many OOV and conditions , and OOV OOV and OOV the OOV of OOV OOV in OOV with the level of development of the regions OOV by Community OOV .
OOV we should OOV the Community OOV to these regions OOV of OOV the regions to OOV to an OOV European policy .
What is OOV <P> ( The President OOV the OOV OOV ) <SPEAKER OOV OOV NAME=" OOV " > Mr President , I should OOV all like to OOV Mr OOV on a most OOV report .
OOV conditions of work were not the best .
It is OOV that we in Parliament should have to deal with a report from the Court of OOV OOV OOV going back many years , but the fact is that Mr OOV has done his OOV and OOV out into the field .
OOV , it is not that I do not OOV Mr OOV , on the OOV , but I too OOV to be in OOV last OOV , and he is right in his OOV .
The OOV of the Commission ' s OOV in OOV has become a OOV OOV .
<P> The Court of OOV ' report OOV that the Commission ' s OOV over funds for the OOV OOV ' s OOV and the OOV , for example , has not , by any means , been good enough .
OOV of the problems are OOV to the OOV having OOV been OOV OOV from OOV .
OOV , the EU OOV on the OOV have been given more OOV and more OOV .
This OOV that the OOV of OOV the OOV more OOV and more responsibility does , in OOV fact , work in OOV .
The Court of OOV OOV that , in future , the EU should give organisations such as the OOV , the OOV and the OOV OOV ' s OOV a OOV of OOV which they can OOV themselves .
At the same time , the Court of OOV would like to see OOV OOV .
I really do not think that this OOV up .
If we OOV give OOV as a OOV form of OOV aid to the OOV , then the Commission will OOV OOV OOV of things and no OOV have any OOV .
The issue of cooperation between the EU and the organisations will become part of the OOV OOV .
The Commission is OOV for clear OOV from the Council and Parliament .
That is something I can well OOV .
We cannot OOV both better OOV and more of a OOV hand .
We OOV need to OOV a certain OOV of OOV over OOV ' OOV .
The OOV system is OOV OOV more and more OOV , OOV and OOV so , in OOV of OOV , I have much more OOV in our own EU system .
<SPEAKER OOV OOV " NAME=" OOV " > Mr President , this debate OOV OOV OOV reports by the Court of OOV on OOV of such OOV OOV and importance that they OOV from a OOV of the OOV of OOV in OOV OOV to a specific and OOV OOV of the Community OOV policy .
I would therefore like to OOV OOV to the OOV issue and to OOV by OOV Mr OOV and the Court of OOV on their excellent work and by OOV the OOV points of the Court ' s OOV .
<P> OOV OOV and OOV , OOV in the OOV sector OOV to over EUR OOV OOV .
OOV European OOV OOV more than EUR OOV to the OOV OOV in OOV .
OOV OOV OOV OOV % of agricultural OOV but only OOV % of OOV OOV .
OOV OOV % of OOV OOV to OOV % of farmers , and OOV % of the OOV OOV OOV % of OOV .
The Court of OOV OOV from this OOV that the current system of support for farmers ' OOV , which is OOV on OOV such as OOV , OOV or area OOV , needs to be OOV by a system OOV on a OOV OOV OOV OOV OOV OOV or working OOV , with OOV support only being OOV to make good any OOV in that OOV .
<P> The OOV in OOV OOV OOV the OOV OOV for the need to OOV the OOV
The OOV political OOV that has been OOV to the OOV of OOV ' s OOV government is a clear OOV that , even at the OOV of Europe , where this OOV was OOV and where it has always OOV its OOV support , it is OOV OOV difficult to OOV an agricultural policy OOV that was OOV to OOV an OOV approach , OOV on OOV OOV .
We must come up with a OOV policy OOV towards regional needs and OOV between farmers if we are to OOV Europe 's cultural heritage and the environment .
This will OOV OOV of the current OOV
<SPEAKER OOV LANGUAGE="FR" NAME=" OOV > Mr President , I shall OOV on certain problems OOV by Mr OOV ' OOV s report to which I should like to OOV your attention .
<P> The measures to OOV young farmers OOV up in OOV are OOV , since in far too many OOV the OOV group OOV the OOV OOV on the OOV of OOV aid even OOV it was OOV at the OOV of OOV an OOV .
OOV the difficult OOV OOV by a OOV number of these young people and the OOV OOV by people working in that sector , a situation where some of them cannot OOV European and national aid OOV to OOV and OOV is not OOV .
<P> As OOV the measures to OOV the employment of young OOV , we would need a OOV OOV before being able to consider the OOV of this policy .
This OOV should take account of the OOV of OOV to employment to be OOV .
As OOV the measures for the OOV of OOV OOV , on the OOV , the OOV has been too OOV , since the OOV aid has been used to OOV OOV of OOV other than the development of OOV OOV .
This is OOV by the fact that different OOV of aid , if not OOV at regional level , can OOV OOV between OOV and a OOV OOV of aid and OOV OOV .
This does not make it possible to OOV a OOV policy which OOV account of the OOV of needs and the OOV of OOV , OOV OOV the OOV OOV of regional development .
<P> In this respect , I cannot go without OOV the OOV OOV by the OOV Group , a OOV we find in various Member States .
We cannot OOV OOV which have been able to OOV European OOV being OOV , even OOV they are in good financial OOV , to OOV , for OOV of OOV OOV , to OOV OOV OOV of people and OOV as many OOV OOV which , once again , will be a OOV on national and European public OOV .
<P> In OOV , one of the major OOV of the European Union is to OOV OOV , which is a priority of the Member States but also of the Commission .
We know how difficult it is to OOV the whole of a OOV group with any OOV .
However , in view of the OOV and OOV that have been OOV , OOV have been OOV to have the necessary OOV made OOV , in particular in order to better OOV the measures and to actually OOV the OOV on to the OOV by OOV OOV in the OOV of OOV and the OOV of OOV , in order to ensure that the results OOV are OOV <P> ( The President OOV the OOV OOV ) <SPEAKER OOV NAME=" OOV " > Mr President , I thank the rapporteur for the specific OOV in his report to two major OOV in OOV OOV OOV to our peace process and for his positive OOV to the OOV OOV for OOV , which is OOV not just by Europe but also by the United States , OOV and OOV .
<P> I would OOV other regions with serious problems of OOV to OOV the work of the OOV OOV in OOV OOV and the OOV OOV .
It has done such OOV work .
For example , it has OOV some OOV OOV OOV , OOV OOV OOV OOV , and OOV OOV % of these OOV are in areas of high OOV and in OOV areas .
OOV OOV OOV people from OOV OOV have been involved in these OOV for OOV OOV in OOV OOV and some OOV OOV people have been involved in the OOV OOV .
It has done an OOV OOV and I welcome the positive OOV in the report to it .
<P> There is also the OOV OOV OOV from the European Union itself .
At OOV level in OOV OOV it too is OOV together people from both OOV of our OOV , in particular with OOV for young people - young OOV and women .
There are OOV OOV to OOV OOV ; there is development and OOV for OOV women - I am just OOV out some of the very OOV OOV that are going on - the development of the OOV industry and , of course , the new OOV development .
<P> We very much welcome and OOV thank the Commission for this , and the Council of OOV for the OOV OOV OOV for OOV OOV .
I should like to OOV my OOV OOV to all my OOV in this Parliament for their OOV support for this peace OOV because it is making such a very positive contribution to the development of peace in my country .
<SPEAKER OOV NAME=" OOV " > Mr President , as a Member of Parliament OOV that part of OOV which OOV from both the OOV and the OOV and OOV OOV , I would like to OOV the OOV OOV of both these funds , and as a OOV who OOV OOV with the local OOV and OOV making excellent use of the funds I would like to state that I am OOV OOV that all OOV OOV through the funds are OOV OOV for .
The OOV and the OOV OOV are OOV funds so it is OOV that certain OOV should have OOV OOV to a OOV of OOV with the OOV OOV and OOV of these funds .
<P> As was OOV out OOV , the EU OOV a major contribution together with the United States , OOV , OOV and OOV OOV .
The OOV has OOV in OOV of OOV million which has OOV an OOV of OOV OOV OOV OOV OOV OOV for OOV OOV right OOV the OOV countries and OOV OOV .
I OOV it OOV OOV that the Committee on OOV OOV should question the OOV of the OOV OOV system .
I believe that these funds have made a major contribution towards the peace process and that Mr OOV should OOV OOV a OOV more in OOV with these funds .
I would OOV OOV to OOV OOV OOV and the OOV countries and to see the situation for OOV .
<SPEAKER OOV OOV " NAME=" OOV > Mr President , it was with great OOV that we OOV the OOV report , which , I OOV , we did not OOV OOV OOV OOV .
OOV OOV , we were rather OOV at the OOV it OOV OOV the agricultural sector , for , if the OOV and OOV are to be OOV so OOV for a sector which is OOV such great , OOV change as the world of OOV is OOV to the common agricultural policy , we are concerned about the decisions to be adopted .
OOV course , the rapporteur , Mr OOV , has OOV a OOV to take : a OOV OOV must be OOV out of the agricultural sector and the rules OOV it .
It is OOV that the OOV process on the decisions to be adopted for OOV was not OOV at the OOV Council .
There will certainly be a great deal to do in that area .
<SPEAKER OOV LANGUAGE="DE " NAME=" OOV " > Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , OOV I would like to thank Mr OOV , Mr OOV , Mr OOV and Mr OOV for their reports on the reports by the Court of OOV , which OOV OOV in all and OOV the OOV OOV , or were OOV in OOV .
<P> I feel this debate has OOV how OOV the OOV OOV by the Court of OOV are , because they OOV particular OOV areas in great OOV .
As Commissioner , I can only welcome these OOV OOV with open OOV because they OOV us to deal with OOV as they OOV , and the Court of OOV OOV its OOV OOV so well that they can have a OOV OOV on new Commission proposals .
<P> OOV course , I must be OOV and I am only able to go into some OOV of Parliament ' s very OOV and OOV reports .
OOV I will deal with the report by Mr OOV , and then I will consider your OOV on the own resources , Mr OOV OOV .
EUR OOV OOV is OOV OOV in OOV OOV , for the OOV of OOV the EU OOV , and a OOV OOV of this OOV is OOV for by OOV and OOV .
<P> OOV the last few years , the Commission has OOV to OOV improve the legal OOV in this area .
I might OOV that in OOV and 2000 , new legal OOV on the OOV OOV in the OOV field OOV into OOV .
They OOV for better OOV of OOV OOV and the OOV of OOV OOV for the OOV of OOV these OOV .
The Community OOV ' s OOV has just OOV been OOV and the OOV has OOV into OOV .
<P> OOV year , OOV Member States were OOV up to the new OOV OOV OOV .
Parliament OOV a great deal in this area through its committee of OOV , which OOV some very OOV results that are now being OOV on by the Commission .
OOV all , it is OOV OOV that the OOV countries are now to be OOV involved in this OOV system , OOV OOV . in this new OOV .
<P> There are two OOV OOV of OOV OOV against OOV OOV to the OOV of OOV in respect of OOV OOV , and the question as to whether this should OOV interest OOV , and OOV is being given to OOV OOV OOV against OOV , OOV and OOV .
In OOV , I might point out that at some point in the next few OOV , the Commission will present its report on the own resources system for the OOV OOV .
OOV in all , it is the Commission ' s OOV to OOV more responsibility to the Member States in the OOV field .
I take the view that in the OOV of OOV OOV which OOV to OOV in OOV OOV , a different OOV should OOV in future to the one OOV in OOV , OOV OOV . it is the Member States themselves that should be OOV for the OOV of OOV in the OOV of OOV .
It is quite OOV a OOV system , in that the last OOV of OOV within the EU OOV has to come into OOV in such OOV , OOV OOV . all Member States then have to OOV OOV to their OOV of OOV .
In other words , the present system is such that those who OOV OOV management are OOV , OOV those who make a OOV OOV are , in fact , the OOV .
It OOV to be the OOV OOV ' first priority to want to change a system of this OOV .
There is no OOV of this OOV yet , but the Commission will continue to OOV the point .
<P> I will now OOV now to the extremely important report on OOV by Mr OOV .
I would like to OOV my OOV for these reports .
They OOV the following OOV : OOV OOV , OOV , OOV and OOV OOV .
I have OOV OOV OOV to make on these , and , Mrs OOV , all I can say is how right you are that this report too OOV , once again , the number of areas in which OOV OOV are OOV .
We have one OOV in the OOV area of OOV OOV , and this OOV a whole OOV of other problems , particularly in terms of financial OOV , because this OOV has OOV to specific OOV OOV measures for OOV OOV and OOV , which OOV OOV problems for financial OOV time and again , or , to put it another way , they OOV OOV for OOV .
<P> The OOV OOV in the OOV OOV OOV the Commission to improve on and OOV OOV OOV OOV to OOV OOV .
The OOV of OOV OOV OOV for financial aid was OOV more OOV , the OOV OOV , particularly in OOV to the OOV of the OOV of OOV in OOV OOV , were OOV , and the aid for OOV OOV OOV OOV for use in OOV OOV was OOV following a OOV OOV , which is something that OOV a great deal of OOV .
This was a necessary OOV OOV , because the OOV of the Court of OOV ' s OOV on this point OOV that OOV had to be taken .
<P> On the subject of OOV - there is also an issue here OOV from the OOV that OOV in this sector - I can OOV that the fact that OOV of aid is OOV on only a few Member States is to be OOV at the OOV OOV of the OOV sector .
This OOV is not OOV but we will take up your OOV on this again OOV .
The Court of OOV ' s OOV with regard to OOV in the OOV of OOV are OOV being given OOV under the OOV of OOV OOV .
<P> The Court of OOV OOV the OOV measures OOV in OOV in the third OOV OOV on the OOV on the OOV sector .
The Commission used these measures as the basis for its own OOV .
In the OOV for a resolution , Parliament , and OOV , Mr OOV , call for OOV OOV to be OOV , in a OOV to OOV the OOV OOV OOV of OOV between OOV and less OOV regions , but also between OOV and small OOV .
This would be possible subject to certain OOV , although not all Member States would OOV it , and there is OOV for OOV here too .
<P> You also OOV the important issue of OOV of OOV aid in the report .
We know what OOV of this matter in OOV 2000 .
However , the Commission OOV that this is another OOV that must be OOV up for OOV again in the course of the OOV OOV .
<P> OOV OOV on the subject of OOV OOV : the Commission is of the same OOV as those who feel that after the last OOV , there is an OOV need to OOV the OOV legal OOV .
It has therefore OOV proposals OOV , and , has also OOV the Commission ' s OOV OOV as a result .
The Commission would agree with you , Mr OOV , that OOV OOV should OOV a greater OOV of the financial OOV of measures to OOV OOV OOV .
In this OOV , the Commission will OOV out an OOV into OOV management OOV in OOV , the OOV of which will be available in the next few OOV , and they are OOV to be the subject of OOV OOV in this House OOV .
<P> I will now OOV to your report Mr OOV , for which the Commission is in your OOV .
In the OOV from OOV to OOV , which is the OOV the Court of OOV ' s OOV OOV OOV to , the Commission - and you OOV this - OOV under extremely difficult political conditions on the OOV .
<P> You OOV the OOV OOV , particularly with regard to the OOV of the open OOV OOV .
OOV , it was necessary for OOV of a very high quality to be made available for this OOV , and OOV , it was important to ensure that the OOV of information was of a very high quality too , with a view to OOV for the OOV OOV , and OOV for OOV OOV .
However , the Commission is OOV to OOV that , in many areas , there was much OOV for OOV and so it has taken the appropriate OOV .
<P> I will go on to OOV the OOV between the EU as OOV , and the OOV of OOV OOV and the OOV for OOV and OOV in Europe as OOV of the financial aid .
This OOV is indeed OOV .
The Commission has been OOV for quite a few OOV OOV , when the OOV actually OOV with the international organisations .
It is not a case of OOV responsibility .
It just OOV to OOV that there are even OOV on the cooperation OOV OOV , which are OOV OOV in OOV .
The Court of OOV is now OOV , as it did back in its OOV OOV OOV , that international organisations should not be OOV OOV OOV but should be OOV OOV OOV OOV .
But how is the Commission OOV to support international organisations with an OOV political OOV when these organisations find it difficult to OOV OOV the OOV and financial OOV of Community aid programmes ?
OOV OOV and OOV are OOV for here .
<P> On the subject of the OOV of OOV and the OOV of OOV in OOV and OOV , which also OOV in the report : the Commission was able , with the aid of OOV OOV by the OOV and OOV programmes , to achieve OOV OOV where OOV is concerned to those of other OOV .
A OOV was OOV in the OOV OOV OOV to the OOV that there were OOV with regard to the OOV of OOV , but this situation has now OOV .
I would also OOV you once again that the Commission has OOV from all the OOV OOV in OOV and OOV when it OOV to OOV EU aid , and has taken the necessary OOV , and it has also OOV the OOV of EU aid , for example in OOV , on an OOV different OOV .
<P> OOV now to the OOV report by Mr OOV , which concerns the principle of OOV as OOV to the OOV OOV , OOV areas , OOV employment OOV , the OOV OOV for OOV and the OOV programme .
OOV , too , I must OOV OOV to a few OOV .
The OOV funds OOV of OOV OOV now OOV new OOV OOV the principle of the OOV of measures , which will OOV help to ensure that , in future , there will be no more OOV for the OOV of OOV OOV by the Court of OOV about the OOV support OOV , and the OOV will be OOV .
<P> I have this to say about the Court of OOV ' s report on OOV areas : one of the OOV OOV of the OOV OOV of the OOV funds has been the OOV of the OOV and OOV OOV , which will OOV us to OOV more OOV where the OOV OOV to .
The OOV now provide for a OOV OOV of responsibility between the Commission and the Member States .
<P> Finally , OOV me just to say a few words about the report on the OOV programme .
Parliament has OOV its OOV concern at the often OOV OOV of the OOV programme in OOV OOV and has OOV for a OOV OOV .
The OOV of the OOV of the peace process in OOV OOV and the support , particularly of the OOV cooperation OOV by local OOV , which Mr OOV made OOV to once again , was not just an OOV OOV , but was also the right programme to my way of OOV , and I am OOV to be able , once again , to OOV the fact that it has Parliament ' s support .
This programme too was OOV under very difficult conditions OOV .
As the Court of OOV report OOV , it was still able , in the end , to OOV a part in OOV the peace and OOV process in OOV OOV .
I believe that was the OOV of the OOV and to that OOV , I am OOV that it could be OOV a OOV at the end of the OOV .
OOV OOV OOV of European OOV OOV and European OOV OOV ( OOV ) <SPEAKER OOV NAME=" President " > The next OOV is the report ( OOV ) by Mr OOV , on behalf of the Committee on OOV OOV , on the report of the Court of OOV on the OOV OOV of the management of the European OOV OOV and the European OOV OOV for the financial year OOV together with the OOV of the European OOV OOV OOV - OOV .
<SPEAKER OOV NAME=" OOV " > Mr President , I would OOV like to OOV the work that the Court of OOV did in OOV the report that my report is OOV on which OOV OOV of OOV work .
I would also like to thank the services of our committee which OOV me a very great deal and indeed the OOV itself which OOV OOV me in OOV for a OOV and OOV me where my report was going OOV .
<P> There is a OOV OOV of OOV OOV this report .
On OOV OOV OOV the European OOV OOV OOV to the European OOV OOV .
The OOV was still the same OOV and OOV of the OOV OOV that were working in the OOV OOV also to the OOV
The OOV OOV on all the OOV and OOV of the OOV .
The Court of OOV ' report OOV a number of problem areas which I will come to OOV .
The European OOV OOV OOV to the report , but its OOV were certainly OOV , I would say OOV ' , and the Court of OOV OOV them quite OOV since they did not give any OOV of OOV that the OOV OOV to take to OOV the OOV OOV by the Court of OOV ' report .
<P> There were two main areas where the Court of OOV OOV problems .
There are OOV two areas in which Parliament , and in particular the Committee on OOV OOV , OOV a great interest .
The Committee was OOV OOV in the OOV 's OOV with OOV , and this is OOV in my report 's OOV OOV which , if will OOV me , I will OOV .
This OOV : " OOV the public OOV of the European OOV OOV , in its OOV report for OOV , to OOV a OOV OOV with the European OOV OOV OOV but OOV clear OOV between the public OOV OOV by the OOV in its OOV OOV report to OOV OOV cooperation with OOV and the decision by the OOV itself to OOV OOV from OOV over OOV OOV , OOV the OOV by the European Court of OOV . "
That is a OOV case that is OOV .
<P> The other part that the Committee was very OOV in was the OOV OOV .
It OOV OOV in this particular case , and when I OOV both OOV why , they both said that they had OOV in the time that they were given and quite within the OOV .
So , I can only OOV the OOV services of OOV and OOV , and I OOV they need greater OOV .
However , I am OOV these problems will not OOV in future .
<P> The main areas OOV as problems in the Court of OOV ' report concerned the OOV 's OOV management and OOV .
The Court of OOV ' report OOV a OOV of any OOV OOV system which had OOV great concern ; that it was difficult to OOV OOV development OOV and OOV ; and that the OOV had OOV a OOV of OOV to OOV some OOV OOV OOV OOV OOV in OOV OOV , but by the end of the year the OOV had still not OOV a OOV OOV for this OOV , although that was OOV for the OOV of the OOV ' work .
It also OOV to a number of OOV problems .
<P> The other point was OOV OOV .
I still find it OOV that the OOV OOV OOV OOV is OOV OOV OOV its way to OOV some OOV the OOV of a OOV % OOV .
The OOV is that they had OOV a OOV in the OOV - OOV a OOV of OOV - put a OOV of work in - and that some of these OOV were being OOV only OOV % over a OOV of years and this was OOV like OOV OOV .
But that is just OOV management and really should not OOV in a OOV like this .
<P> As to my OOV , I was not really OOV what I should do .
As OOV who is not a great OOV of the European OOV OOV and certainly not his country 's OOV into it , I had a OOV with this report .
OOV I would like to OOV that the OOV take OOV of what the Court of OOV has said , I could have used this report to OOV the OOV and OOV great OOV for OOV back OOV , but that was not the role of the rapporteur .
So I OOV to the OOV and OOV for a meeting .
They OOV OOV me to OOV , and I was OOV that they had OOV their OOV policy , that they had OOV the problems in OOV management , and so my report is , if not actually OOV , then OOV by this meeting with the OOV
<P> At my meeting with the OOV , I was OOV that it had OOV its problems especially OOV to the OOV and this would not OOV again and it would OOV a OOV to the Committee OOV its current OOV policy .
As it OOV , this OOV has OOV OOV up , and that is a great OOV because the European OOV OOV should not really OOV OOV from this OOV .
We are OOV OOV our OOV .
OOV problems OOV , and they always will , it should not be the OOV of the OOV to OOV over the OOV and OOV down the OOV .
It should deal with the problems and OOV the EU and its public how it has OOV with them and not have a OOV OOV over how it OOV these things .
<P> As my OOV has OOV , the report could OOV have been a OOV OOV , and the OOV has OOV OOV OOV OOV this year .
If OOV or more problems OOV next year , they might find such a report a OOV OOV , OOV they OOV to actually open up , have a OOV with our Committee , become more OOV and OOV to all of us in this Parliament .
<P> <SPEAKER OOV LANGUAGE="SV" NAME=" OOV " > Mr President , the Court of OOV ' report on the OOV OOV , of course , to the OOV of OOV from the OOV to today ' s OOV , a fact which OOV the report itself .
A number of the problems OOV out in the report are OOV concerned with the OOV .
OOV of the OOV is OOV at OOV OOV OOV more upon how much OOV had been OOV than upon how much had actually been OOV .
<P> However , the main OOV from both the Court of OOV and the Committee on OOV OOV concerns the OOV OOV which the OOV ' s OOV OOV over and OOV their OOV OOV and which OOV OOV both the OOV OOV set and the OOV costs .
The OOV for OOV about this OOV OOV were also OOV .
<P> The OOV has OOV on the OOV and OOV , OOV other things , that it has OOV its OOV and taken the OOV of its OOV management on OOV .
The OOV also OOV that there has been a OOV of OOV OOV this OOV OOV .
We are also OOV that the OOV now OOV that OOV must be able to OOV out OOV OOV .
However , it is a great OOV about the OOV involved .
<P> I am responsible for the Committee on OOV and OOV OOV ' opinion on this matter , and our OOV are OOV and OOV .
<P> OOV of all : even OOV this was a difficult OOV OOV , there is a great deal of OOV in the Court of OOV ' OOV on , for example , OOV management , and these must be taken account of in future .
<P> OOV : the OOV of OOV system OOV is quite OOV in the OOV world , but the OOV of OOV OOV in this case and the way in which the system was OOV with OOV OOV OOV .
What is most OOV and a matter of serious concern is the fact that , in the Swedish and other OOV , the OOV ' s public relations OOV OOV both the Court of OOV ' and the European Parliament ' s OOV which , he OOV , is not taken OOV in the OOV world .
If the OOV , which is already OOV for OOV of OOV , does not take the OOV OOV , it is in OOV of OOV public OOV .
OOV committee does not , however , believe that the OOV is so serious in OOV that it needs to OOV OOV in the OOV or OOV the OOV ' s OOV to be OOV .
On the OOV , the OOV OOV OOV OOV for the OOV OOV from OOV to OOV <SPEAKER OOV OOV NAME=" OOV " > Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , my point is that the European OOV OOV is going through a OOV OOV , what with OOV OOV , the OOV in the OOV against the OOV , the OOV of OOV in the OOV being OOV and the OOV OOV against the OOV , which is a OOV OOV the European OOV OOV the European system can OOV .
It is not enough for OOV 's OOV to be OOV , OOV must also OOV to be OOV .
I see the European OOV OOV as OOV 's OOV and OOV is OOV , but OOV must make more of an OOV to OOV the OOV world that OOV is OOV .
OOV , if the OOV be OOV , quite a few of our OOV are not OOV OOV on the OOV .
We must OOV not to give OOV an OOV to OOV their OOV ; we must OOV the OOV for the OOV to OOV more OOV who will then OOV to the OOV OOV .
<P> I would also point out , as OOV the OOV OOV which has OOV such a OOV , that if there is OOV for OOV every OOV at the European OOV OOV an OOV OOV of OOV % of their OOV , then OOV % over a OOV of OOV OOV OOV out at OOV % OOV OOV .
So I OOV to see what there is to OOV about something which is within the OOV of both what is OOV and what has been OOV .
OOV the OOV have been OOV .
However , I would point out that , OOV is done must be done in the best , most OOV , most OOV OOV and with the OOV possible OOV OOV the OOV world .
<SPEAKER OOV OOV " NAME=" OOV > Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , we OOV the report OOV by the rapporteur , Mr OOV , in committee , and we will support it in this House , for it OOV both OOV and OOV OOV in its OOV on the issues OOV by the report of the Court of OOV on the management of the OOV and the OOV
The three points OOV by Mr OOV are the OOV OOV of OOV , the OOV of an OOV OOV to OOV OOV and the OOV to be subject to OOV OOV .
<P> I would not OOV that it OOV to any of us that the OOV would OOV or that such a OOV would be OOV .
That is not the point .
The point , in our opinion , is that the greater our OOV of the OOV of the OOV OOV in question - and I OOV this OOV , although I also take OOV of the clear need for political OOV of the OOV at European level as well - the greater the need to OOV them to provide clear OOV of OOV , OOV OOV and OOV .
<P> There is an OOV OOV , OOV to people OOV OOV do not OOV their words , which OOV like this : " OOV what I say , not what I do " .
OOV OOV role and OOV OOV them a point of OOV for such a OOV public and for all the OOV - such as the European OOV OOV , which has our OOV - cannot OOV themselves even a OOV OOV , and still less can they say , " OOV what I say , not what I do " OOV OOV OOV OOV , management OOV and the OOV possible OOV and OOV .
<P> It is OOV because of the major , OOV role of these OOV - and I wish to OOV this by way of OOV - and because the issues OOV can be OOV that we are OOV that the OOV of the Court of OOV and the European Parliament will be given OOV OOV .
<SPEAKER OOV NAME=" President " > The debate is OOV .
<P> The vote will be taken at OOV OOV .
OOV OOV OOV OOV to OOV ( OOV ) <SPEAKER OOV NAME=" President " > The next OOV is the report ( OOV ) by Mr OOV , on behalf of the Committee on OOV and OOV OOV , on the report from the Commission to the European Parliament and the Council : OOV and OOV OOV - OOV on financial OOV for OOV and OOV OOV OOV - and OOV OOV OOV ( OOV ) - As at OOV OOV OOV OOV ) OOV - OOV - OOV .
<SPEAKER OOV NAME=" OOV " > Mr President , I wish to OOV by just OOV the House of a few OOV .
There are at least OOV million OOV within the EU , OOV % of them are OOV to OOV .
There are OOV million people working in the EU in the OOV sector and , of these , OOV million people work in OOV , which is OOV of less than OOV people ; OOV million people work in small to OOV OOV , with less than OOV people .
So a OOV of OOV million workers in the EU are in the small and OOV sector , which OOV that it is very important for us to be OOV the OOV of such a sector .
In particular , it is OOV right that this specific initiative - OOV and employment - should be OOV within the Committee on OOV and OOV OOV , although it is clearly also of interest to other OOV .
<P> This particular report is concerned with OOV programmes , which was an important initiative from this Parliament a few years OOV .
But it is OOV OOV OOV OOV , as OOV at the OOV OOV , that the issue of the development of OOV is not just a matter of OOV .
It is also very important that all of us OOV the right OOV for OOV , with less OOV OOV and less OOV , to OOV OOV and OOV to actually consider taking out OOV OOV in the first place .
<P> OOV was the first full year of this particular set of OOV and , therefore , as a OOV OOV it should have been OOV OOV to report upon this without being too OOV .
However , there are some OOV OOV in the report , OOV because of the Commission OOV in OOV its report .
I have OOV the OOV OOV to the report .
It OOV that OOV the OOV OOV proposal from the Commission OOV out in OOV OOV , it OOV OOV a full OOV OOV before the report OOV before Parliament .
OOV there was a further OOV within Parliament , because we are not OOV in that respect OOV .
It OOV over a OOV to OOV it to a rapporteur and then , because of the OOV OOV , it was not possible to programme the OOV debate and OOV OOV OOV and OOV .
OOV this long OOV , there was further OOV , OOV I say , within the OOV because the Committee on OOV , OOV OOV , OOV and OOV under Mrs OOV as the rapporteur had OOV some very OOV amendments to the report which only OOV to the Committee on OOV after we had OOV on the report .
So that again was not OOV OOV .
I have agreed with Mrs OOV that amendments from the committee today have my full support to go through OOV , as there are a number of OOV OOV there .
<P> I should OOV that I OOV the Commission back in OOV about a particular OOV in the report , which OOV that in OOV there would be some OOV from OOV about their OOV to the OOV .
However , the Commission did not OOV .
I OOV again in OOV where this information was and it OOV OOV : " What information are you OOV for ?
We do not OOV OOV "
It was OOV only OOV that I OOV an OOV from the Commission OOV that there was such information but it had been OOV to the Committee on OOV rather than to our committee - again , not too OOV .
<P> OOV , I OOV in the debate on the OOV report on OOV OOV OOV .
I should like to OOV those OOV now , because the fact that this report had to go through so many different OOV before it OOV - including legal , OOV , financial OOV , general OOV , regional , OOV , employment and social OOV , OOV , OOV market and OOV - is not an OOV way of OOV with an important subject .
I OOV not only on behalf of this report but also , I am OOV , of other reports that need to go through the same system .
This is just too much OOV .
There are too many OOV involved and , as a result , the OOV OOV up not being fully OOV .
<P> Finally , I have made a few OOV about the European OOV OOV taking a OOV interest in the OOV
This may be OOV right given its OOV , but we want to ensure that these particular OOV are given the priority they OOV .
I am not particularly OOV but we shall OOV to see how that OOV .
I have also OOV for a full OOV , not because of any OOV about the financial OOV , but just as a OOV management OOV system .
<P> In OOV , may I say that the Commission has OOV already OOV the OOV report for the year 2000 .
I should like to ask that we see it now so that we can make a positive contribution now in good time , rather than OOV the OOV of the current report .
OOV we are in OOV OOV OOV and OOV on a report that was OOV back in OOV .
It is already OOV .
On such an important subject we want to deal with the present , OOV being better able to OOV the future .
<SPEAKER OOV LANGUAGE="FR" OOV " > Mr President , I should first of all like to OOV the rapporteur and to OOV that there is OOV no OOV in the OOV of the Committee on OOV and OOV OOV and the Committee on OOV , OOV OOV , OOV and OOV .
We therefore OOV the rapporteur ' s OOV , particularly his OOV on OOV , which should be OOV in future .
The Committee on OOV OOV OOV to a greater OOV the importance of OOV for employment , the need to OOV OOV to OOV OOV , the need to OOV OOV and OOV OOV and OOV OOV the OOV between the various Commission programmes of interest to small and OOV OOV .
<P> We therefore OOV a number of amendments and , as the rapporteur has just OOV , OOV to an OOV OOV of OOV , the rapporteur did not OOV the amendments in time .
I should like to thank OOV , OOV , for having OOV to OOV OOV OOV OOV to OOV , which OOV the OOV of the Committee on OOV ' s amendments , which OOV the rapporteur ' s report .
<SPEAKER OOV LANGUAGE="DE " NAME=" OOV , OOV " > Mr President , the OOV OOV was OOV by OOV decisions .
However , it will not OOV progress towards an OOV OOV European Union .
OOV national measures have no OOV , that is when Europe OOV into OOV .
We are OOV this with OOV
OOV , all OOV are OOV for OOV OOV OOV OOV and OOV action where OOV OOV OOV are concerned .
We are also OOV this with the OOV against OOV .
The OOV feel the OOV of OOV OOV for OOV and employment , which are OOV to OOV the measures OOV by the Member States .
OOV of the first things to come out of this programme is that EUR OOV million is to be made available for OOV OOV .
<P> On behalf of the OOV Group , I would like to OOV OOV OOV on his report , which OOV OOV to his OOV OOV OOV .
We OOV with his OOV of the Commission for OOV too OOV information too OOV .
OOV how are we OOV to OOV OOV OOV , or even OOV OOV programme proposals under such OOV OOV of time ?
We need OOV on which of the three OOV - OOV OOV , OOV , or OOV OOV - have OOV the best results , in which States and which OOV OOV were set up , whether the small OOV had OOV to OOV OOV too , or whether OOV OOV from OOV OOV are OOV , OOV to which , more than OOV OOV new OOV were OOV OOV by means of interest OOV to the OOV of EUR OOV million , which OOV OOV are especially OOV , and to what OOV women were involved .
<P> In OOV to OOV in my OOV , I OOV OOV with OOV that the funds are OOV only OOV OOV to OOV in OOV OOV .
OOV OOV OOV , from the OOV industry for example , OOV to OOV , too , to my OOV .
We must also take greater account of the OOV of services .
<P> Mr President , OOV us OOV on the initiative OOV from Mr OOV ' excellent report .
The more OOV the information , the OOV OOV in EU OOV will OOV .
<SPEAKER OOV NAME=" OOV " > Mr President , on behalf of the OOV Group , I very much support this report and in particular the OOV OOV the OOV OOV OOV and the OOV and OOV OOV OOV OOV .
I am OOV there is a OOV opinion OOV this House of how important small OOV are .
In my own country , the United OOV , the small OOV OOV has actually OOV in OOV by one OOV since OOV and there is now one small OOV for every OOV OOV in the OOV .
OOV OOV are important not just for OOV but also for trade in this European Union .
I OOV OOV with the OOV in the OOV OOV OOV with OOV and the OOV countries and OOV into those countries , who OOV me that the OOV OOV , over OOV % of the OOV which he OOV with , are not from OOV OOV OOV to OOV but from small OOV .
So that is very OOV to us in this House too .
<P> It is OOV because of the OOV process .
We OOV the OOV from the OOV OOV last year : the OOV towards OOV , the OOV towards OOV , towards OOV that were OOV there .
These OOV should be OOV very much as being at the OOV of OOV to achieve those economic OOV .
<P> I would also like to change OOV OOV by OOV Mr OOV .
I have OOV in the Committee on OOV and OOV OOV with OOV for the last year or so and I have OOV OOV make the same OOV time after time about OOV and too much OOV at European level .
OOV has actually come up with something OOV here , so well done Mr OOV .
OOV to see that you can do some work , or at least OOV can do it on your behalf .
<P> I particularly OOV you on your OOV OOV the need for more OOV and OOV - OOV support for that - and on the importance of the high OOV OOV - OOV , but not just those .
OOV , I am very OOV to see you OOV OOV on the need to increase OOV OOV in small OOV .
OOV to you for OOV that .
<P> I would have OOV to see more on the social OOV .
OOV OOV OOV should be OOV OOV and OOV as part of the small OOV sector .
They are particularly important in terms of OOV OOV OOV OOV OOV in the OOV market .
They are particularly important in terms of OOV OOV employment and it is an OOV that they are OOV from the report .
They should not be OOV OOV ; they should be given OOV help .
OOV the Commission could OOV on that at the OOV of the debate .
<P> I would also like to particularly support OOV No OOV from the OOV Group .
We will be OOV all of the amendments to the OOV that OOV OOV OOV OOV OOV are still far too OOV , far too OOV and actually OOV OOV from OOV OOV in the OOV and in other European countries .
<P> OOV me OOV by OOV that OOV the OOV Government OOV OOV small first , a OOV about OOV that every OOV of government OOV about small OOV , not just about the OOV of OOV that we are OOV in this debate but about the OOV OOV framework and the OOV of OOV and OOV that they need to support them and become OOV .
We in this European Union should OOV that OOV and ensure that every OOV , every OOV of the European Union OOV small OOV first .
<SPEAKER OOV OOV NAME=" OOV " > Mr President , I want first of all to OOV Mr OOV on his report .
OOV has OOV a good OOV of work in OOV of difficult conditions , and we in the Group of the European OOV , OOV and OOV OOV very much agree with his OOV , as well as with the amendments OOV by the Committee on OOV , OOV OOV , OOV and OOV .
There are , of course , many different OOV to OOV full employment , but this cannot be OOV without economic progress and a high OOV of OOV .
This was also , of course , the OOV OOV by the OOV OOV last year which OOV OOV OOV and development as the means to OOV employment in the OOV
OOV , every OOV has a OOV OOV for small and OOV OOV .
At any OOV , that is OOV OOV we OOV our OOV in OOV of their importance to economic development and employment .
<P> OOV it OOV to OOV OOV , however , the OOV is all too often different .
OOV too many OOV are OOV in the way in the form of OOV rules which OOV many people from OOV up in OOV .
There are not enough OOV to take OOV , and this OOV OOV development and OOV .
We cannot , of course , get OOV from the fact that , in general , there is less OOV to take OOV in the EU than in the United States , something which is OOV in less OOV new OOV development .
I therefore also think it is important to ensure that these programmes which , through the European OOV OOV , provide small and OOV OOV with new OOV OOV OOV as OOV as possible in the OOV of the OOV concerned .
The programmes must be made more OOV OOV and OOV to other programmes , and it must of course be OOV that the OOV are not OOV out , indeed that the programmes OOV with a OOV of OOV .
Mr OOV ' s excellent report and the amendments OOV by the Committee on OOV , OOV OOV , OOV and OOV OOV OOV of OOV to OOV .
That OOV should be taken on OOV so that our OOV OOV for small and OOV OOV do not only find OOV in OOV OOV OOV , but also in OOV .
We must also ensure that the programmes are OOV OOV , and I am therefore particularly OOV about Mr OOV ' s OOV that the Commission OOV up the programmes and OOV their OOV on employment .
<SPEAKER OOV LANGUAGE="DE " NAME=" OOV > Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , it is quite OOV what excellent reports are OOV , although the Commission basis is OOV OOV .
The rapporteur OOV forward the proposal that OOV that have not taken up support programmes should be OOV .
<P> I OOV OOV OOV on this , in my OOV as OOV of a OOV OOV .
The OOV OOV OOV was as OOV : when it OOV to the European OOV OOV , and especially the various OOV of the OOV OOV OOV OOV ( OOV ) on OOV and OOV OOV , we small OOV OOV OOV of things because there is a OOV of OOV OOV , responsibility for which is in all OOV of different OOV , I might OOV .
For example , there is the OOV OOV OOV OOV , the OOV and employment initiative , the OOV and environmental initiative , the OOV OOV OOV OOV , the OOV OOV , new OOV for OOV OOV to OOV since OOV , OOV , OOV OOV . <P> OOV are these OOV from one another and where must I , as OOV , OOV the OOV for my OOV OOV ?
Parliament has the same problem from the OOV OOV , if it OOV to OOV how the OOV is OOV OOV , because the reports from the OOV and OOV do not OOV a OOV account .
OOV there is OOV , in general terms , of the full OOV of OOV support , and OOV the OOV OOV of the OOV are OOV in different OOV .
<P> There are also a few things OOV with the OOV of the OOV on the policy OOV .
The OOV and environmental initiative has not OOV any more funds .
What is more , it OOV for a OOV OOV OOV OOV of environmental OOV .
The OOV areas , OOV OOV . OOV and employment , OOV , OOV . have OOV OOV OOV , I OOV you , but they OOV on a few OOV OOV OOV , OOV OOV , OOV and OOV OOV .
<P> In many OOV , these OOV are not OOV with OOV ; OOV the OOV OOV is OOV by OOV , OOV OOV OOV OOV and OOV funds , which OOV the OOV and OOV from the OOV , and which the OOV have to go to with any OOV .
That being the case , in fact OOV but the OOV OOV which OOV are OOV support for OOV which OOV , and how many OOV are being OOV in the process .
That is why OOV , when OOV the OOV these programmes have on employment , rather than OOV OOV OOV , the OOV has OOV a OOV OOV OOV OOV .
OOV OOV information will be available on the OOV of the whole OOV in OOV to OOV years ' time .
OOV has it that OOV , the OOV OOV to OOV the European OOV OOV market for information and OOV , OOV OOV and OOV up new OOV , and that the OOV OOV OOV is not actually OOV in greater OOV or OOV .
The OOV OOV OOV the OOV of funds to which the OOV has given OOV and OOV , OOV this OOV .
<SPEAKER OOV OOV " NAME=" OOV OOV OOV > Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , this is one of those OOV on which we cannot and , in fact , do not have any OOV or OOV as to our political approach .
OOV of all , programmes OOV at OOV employment and OOV are still OOV important , OOV some positive OOV in recent years .
OOV , the OOV importance of small and OOV OOV in this area is quite clear and OOV , as was OOV in the OOV of the initiative for greater employment , which was OOV OOV by the OOV OOV down at the OOV OOV .
I too , like the rapporteur , OOV I OOV , wish to OOV the OOV OOV OOV that OOV for a OOV OOV the OOV of small and OOV OOV , and in particular a OOV framework which is OOV to OOV , OOV and OOV .
OOV , we are all fully aware of the particularly OOV OOV as well as the new OOV that economic OOV OOV for small and OOV OOV .
OOV , it is OOV for the European Union and the Member States to OOV the OOV OOV that OOV in many areas between the EU and the United States .
<P> If we are to OOV our OOV in this area , we must have good information in good time .
This has , OOV now , not been the case .
I agree with the rapporteur ' s OOV and I also call for the OOV 2000 report to be OOV to us in time , by OOV of this year , OOV the OOV OOV that we have OOV from making this year will have to be made with even greater OOV next year .
In its OOV OOV , the Commission must OOV the priority and the importance that we OOV to these areas and ensure that these are OOV in the quality of its OOV OOV .
<P> In OOV , I think that we must improve our OOV : I agree with the rapporteur when he OOV that our interest in high OOV and OOV OOV must not OOV that we OOV the more OOV OOV OOV involved in OOV , trade , OOV and in services in general .
We must consider the amendments , since we need to OOV a greater OOV to OOV OOV OOV .
The amendments also , in my opinion , OOV the report well .
<SPEAKER OOV LANGUAGE="FR" NAME=" OOV " > Mr President , Europe OOV OOV it OOV to OOV the OOV of government policy .
That is not the case in this report .
I therefore find the OOV OOV here of the OOV of the programme on OOV OOV OOV particularly OOV .
OOV , since the agreement of the Council for OOV and OOV OOV on OOV OOV 2000 OOV the OOV of OOV of OOV for the European OOV , the legal and OOV OOV for OOV are OOV up .
This is OOV , since OOV form OOV % of all OOV and OOV OOV % of the European OOV .
<P> OOV the OOV of an OOV OOV to OOV to a OOV OOV OOV a OOV OOV of OOV OOV and OOV .
The great OOV of them are OOV OOV at most OOV OOV .
It is to be OOV that their OOV OOV have not been OOV and that they do not OOV from OOV measures .
OOV the Committee on OOV , OOV OOV , OOV and OOV , which OOV it in its opinion , the Committee on OOV and OOV OOV does not OOV any such OOV .
OOV , the aid programme should not be OOV for the OOV OOV OOV or OOV OOV OOV OOV .
The OOV sector should also be able to OOV in full .
I am OOV in particular of the OOV sector , which OOV employment , OOV and OOV .
<P> OOV this point of view , I support the programme of OOV OOV for OOV .
On the other hand , I am more OOV of the OOV of OOV Member States to OOV their OOV OOV .
There are OOV to OOV a OOV European OOV for OOV OOV OOV funds OOV in OOV with national OOV .
This is OOV to make OOV OOV more OOV for the small OOV who do not OOV have the resources to deal with them .
<SPEAKER OOV OOV " NAME=" OOV " > Mr President , I am OOV to be OOV on this major OOV OOV by Mr OOV , OOV I have the OOV to call my OOV .
I am OOV to see that this report , which is so important for the development of small and OOV OOV in Europe , has been so well OOV , and I hope that Mr OOV will continue to be a OOV of OOV for all those OOV up European Union OOV measures on small and OOV OOV .
OOV is certainly one of the OOV authorities on the matter , which OOV extremely important after the OOV of OOV .
<P> As we are all aware , OOV and the countries of the OOV OOV OOV OOV initiative .
There were no small OOV in OOV OOV .
We have now OOV the OOV of the economic system of OOV initiative .
I therefore OOV Mr OOV to OOV in future - and Commissioner OOV to OOV in OOV both now and in future - that , in OOV to the major OOV OOV in this report , it would be appropriate to call OOV upon the Member States to OOV small OOV which are just OOV OOV from OOV for at least the first OOV years of OOV .
OOV OOV a OOV initiative OOV at least one OOV - his own - and often OOV OOV OOV and other people as well .
<P> I am OOV that this proposal will be OOV to Mr OOV ' OOV , for he is OOV for being OOV to OOV , and I therefore hope that both he and Commissioner OOV will OOV it .
<SPEAKER OOV OOV " OOV > Mr President , I would like to start by OOV Mr OOV on this major report .
I also have to say that I am extremely OOV to OOV for having OOV the amendments I OOV which OOV the main part of the report on certain points and certain OOV issues .
In my opinion , it is extremely important to be OOV on the development of small and OOV OOV and what that OOV , in order to OOV the OOV in OOV OOV , OOV from OOV OOV .
Europe must , therefore , make it a priority to support OOV , OOV a OOV OOV for their OOV and development , OOV OOV and , OOV all , OOV the OOV OOV .
It is also of OOV importance that the European Parliament OOV in OOV both the OOV and the results made possible by European OOV .
<P> This would OOV to be of OOV importance , together with the fact that small and OOV OOV in the small OOV , trade and OOV OOV - as I OOV out - and other services will also OOV .
We must take on OOV the fact that the OOV when people OOV in the same OOV all their OOV has OOV , that we must change our OOV of employment and that the sector of small and OOV industry and OOV OOV will provide OOV OOV OOV OOV for our young people and for the future European citizens .
It is OOV for Europe to OOV on these OOV and we must continue to have OOV in this approach .
<SPEAKER OOV OOV OOV > Mr President , I would like to thank my OOV , Mr OOV , for the great OOV he has OOV in OOV this report .
OOV OOV now OOV OOV of the OOV in the whole of the European Union , there is still employment OOV in the OOV sector .
OOV and OOV OOV OOV a OOV is being set up are OOV important for the OOV of OOV , as , OOV to certain OOV , OOV use as much as OOV % to OOV % of OOV OOV market resources in taking on OOV .
We must give OOV that have OOV for OOV our OOV support , OOV of what sector they OOV in .
OOV attention must also be OOV to making it OOV for OOV to OOV , so that OOV may take full OOV of the OOV OOV by the OOV market .
OOV great in this regard are the OOV OOV with OOV systems of OOV and OOV OOV OOV OOV , which we are OOV in the Committee on OOV and OOV OOV .
I fully agree with the rapporteur that the Commission should , in future , provide information more OOV on how this important initiative is OOV .
In future , the Commission ' s reports should OOV OOV on the OOV of the OOV so that OOV in the system can be OOV OOV .
<P> Finally , I would like to OOV attention on those legal OOV which OOV to make it OOV for OOV OOV to OOV OOV again .
OOV these OOV have OOV to be a OOV once , that does not OOV that the same OOV will OOV in the future .
OOV OOV should rather be OOV as a OOV for Europe , which we should not OOV to OOV .
I would also like to OOV how important small OOV are for OOV with regard to Europe ' s OOV OOV .
OOV OOV often work as OOV for our European OOV organisations , and , as a result , the position of small OOV is more important than OOV for OOV OOV Europe .
<SPEAKER OOV LANGUAGE="DE " NAME=" OOV > Mr President , I am OOV that this report has been put before the House .
OOV with my being an OOV , I would like to OOV the Commission on having OOV out , to excellent OOV , what is OOV in Europe .
What it OOV down to is that there is not enough OOV OOV available for people who want to set up in OOV , and so OOV young OOV have to give up again OOV .
OOV OOV a OOV of course , and so it is particularly important for OOV OOV to OOV financial support in the OOV OOV , more than at any other time .
The OOV system OOV to ensure that not OOV who is OOV to become an OOV OOV OOV his OOV in the process and OOV the OOV of financial OOV , at the very least , for the OOV of his life .
<P> OOV we consider that OOV EUR OOV OOV is available in OOV OOV in Europe , OOV in OOV the OOV OOV at EUR OOV OOV , then we OOV to give OOV to how we can make good the OOV .
What OOV can we take , particularly as OOV OOV ?
The very OOV OOV OOV to OOV us to OOV on what OOV of young OOV we could OOV in order better to OOV OOV safety , OOV out OOV OOV , OOV OOV and so on .
OOV action is OOV for here .
<P> I would also like to OOV that it is important for young OOV to be given a OOV they can OOV on as OOV as possible .
OOV should be set by which a decision must be given in the form of a clear OOV ' or OOV ' , so as to OOV any OOV OOV .
It is also important to OOV the directive on OOV OOV in OOV , so that people actually get their OOV on the OOV within a set OOV of time .
There is still too much OOV on this OOV for my OOV .
The Commission should OOV proposals on OOV management , OOV best OOV OOV , OOV OOV , on the basis of which it will be possible to OOV how much time OOV between the first OOV and the OOV OOV of OOV .
It also needs to OOV OOV OOV , and OOV , OOV the OOV OOV in the public OOV .
OOV it OOV to OOV , one OOV would be to have a OOV OOV of the year ' OOV , OOV to the OOV who has OOV the most OOV in OOV terms and in OOV OOV .
<P> This would OOV at European level , and OOV in the Member States , that we are going the right way about this .
<P> <SPEAKER OOV NAME=" OOV " > Mr President , as I am here OOV of my OOV OOV OOV OOV , I will give his OOV in OOV , also in OOV of the rapporteur .
<P> This report concerns the first OOV report on the OOV and OOV OOV .
This initiative OOV to provide financial OOV for OOV and OOV small and OOV OOV as a OOV towards the development of a OOV OOV OOV to OOV , OOV and OOV .
It is also in OOV with the OOV European Council OOV of OOV 2000 where the OOV of OOV employment , economic OOV and social OOV as part of a OOV OOV were set as a new OOV OOV for the Union .
<P> I would like to OOV the main points OOV by the Committee on OOV and OOV OOV ' report OOV by Mr OOV .
<P> OOV , the report OOV that the Commission OOV process is too OOV , OOV OOV in the OOV of the report by Parliament .
At the same time , Parliament 's report OOV that there is a OOV of information particularly OOV OOV information from small and OOV OOV , OOV of the OOV and OOV OOV .
<P> In my view , these two OOV are OOV and are a result of the way the financial OOV that form part of the OOV and OOV OOV are OOV .
These are OOV so as to OOV OOV resources to financial OOV such as OOV OOV funds , national OOV OOV and OOV OOV which would OOV as OOV for OOV OOV OOV .
<P> In this respect , the information OOV OOV and OOV made to financial OOV in a given year is available during the first OOV of the following year .
On the other hand , OOV information from small and OOV OOV OOV a given year is only available for all the OOV in the last OOV of the following year .
This OOV that an OOV report OOV up by the end of OOV will OOV OOV OOV for the OOV year at the financial OOV level and at the OOV level , OOV OOV for the OOV year .
These OOV OOV why last year 's OOV report OOV to OOV , which was the first full year of the programme , could not OOV OOV information at OOV level .
<P> This OOV us to the following point : OOV the initiative is an OOV OOV by both Parliament and the Commission .
However , a OOV of the financial OOV of the initiative cannot be done OOV .
OOV of all , market OOV could be OOV and find it difficult to OOV the OOV for these OOV .
OOV , a OOV OOV of these OOV OOV on a OOV approach is OOV .
<P> OOV the OOV programme which has had the OOV OOV out of the three financial OOV of the OOV and OOV OOV , the OOV programme for OOV OOV a OOV of the OOV to OOV OOV ' OOV for financial OOV to be OOV with more OOV by the financial OOV and the Commission services .
The OOV of OOV the OOV OOV will also be OOV in order to OOV more OOV to the needs of small and OOV OOV .
<P> OOV the OOV of the European OOV OOV , the report is OOV in OOV that the Commission can no OOV use the OOV OOV as a OOV for OOV OOV .
As before , current and the future Community OOV OOV to the European OOV OOV will be OOV OOV from its own resources under the principle set and OOV by the Commission services .
<P> Finally , the report OOV the OOV OOV of OOV OOV funds and OOV on the Commission to OOV each Member State to OOV OOV OOV OOV funds to be OOV in their country and to OOV OOV funds OOV in a OOV way in other Member States .
This matter , which is of great interest to the Commission , has OOV been OOV with in the Commission OOV on the OOV OOV action plan which was OOV in OOV 2000 .
OOV OOV from the report " the OOV OOV might OOV OOV OOV by OOV specific OOV OOV or even OOV against OOV OOV .
A OOV OOV to such OOV might be OOV most OOV through OOV action on EU level .
In any OOV , Member States have to make OOV that OOV OOV and all other OOV law OOV OOV OOV of OOV in OOV OOV ' .
<P> OOV OOV , now that the OOV of the European OOV OOV is OOV , the Commission services and the OOV are working together to OOV OOV the OOV and OOV Council 's decisions , in particular with the OOV programme for OOV .
<P> OOV be OOV , Parliament should not OOV any OOV result before OOV or OOV , although OOV OOV in particular from OOV OOV might be available OOV .
<P> OOV me OOV as the OOV Commissioner , that the Commission has OOV Parliament 's decision for the OOV OOV to increase OOV for OOV and OOV available to OOV .
<P> This was an important OOV to the small and OOV OOV and an important OOV to achieve the OOV of OOV to OOV a OOV OOV OOV in the European Union .
<SPEAKER OOV NAME=" President " > The debate is OOV .
<P> The vote will be taken at OOV OOV .
OOV OOV OOV workers <SPEAKER OOV NAME=" President " > The next OOV is the report ( OOV ) by Mrs OOV , on behalf of the Committee on OOV and OOV OOV , on the situation of OOV workers OOV .
<SPEAKER OOV OOV " NAME=" OOV " > Mr President , it OOV as a OOV to me as well that this debate was being OOV in today .
The OOV of OOV work has OOV me for over OOV years , the OOV of time I have OOV in OOV , in the OOV OOV OOV , but also in the European Parliament .
It OOV me not only because I am OOV OOV with problems which OOV workers OOV when they OOV in one Member State and work in another , but also because the OOV OOV it are quite OOV , OOV which have to be OOV OOV .
It also OOV me because it OOV that OOV , national OOV that is , are not OOV things OOV OOV enough .
OOV reason why it OOV me is that what OOV OOV OOV to OOV out , the European Court of OOV OOV to OOV , and Member States are always being OOV about OOV right any OOV OOV .
This OOV me to a OOV which I would like to make OOV the European Commission .
<P> I have no OOV to OOV with the European Commission .
It is particularly the Council , the OOV of the Council , who are OOV to OOV OOV work the OOV it needs , and so we OOV , national OOV that is , OOV this for the European Court of OOV to OOV .
I think this is no OOV OOV , or necessary , for that matter , and that we must make every OOV , and OOV all means , in order to change this situation .
<P> What I want in my report - and I would like to thank my OOV OOV who have OOV in the OOV , as well as OOV who have OOV on this OOV - is OOV things .
OOV of all , I would make an OOV OOV to the Commission to OOV a directive which OOV for OOV OOV reports .
This OOV has been put to the European Commission and the Member States since OOV .
OOV reports would OOV Member States , when OOV their legislation on social security , OOV or public health , to OOV an OOV OOV OOV in order to OOV the OOV on OOV workers .
OOV ?
OOV because this will make OOV , but because it will help us to OOV in a OOV OOV ; and help us to OOV problems from OOV .
<P> OOV second OOV to the Council is at long last to OOV the amendments in OOV OOV without any further OOV .
I believe this OOV has been with the Council of OOV , the OOV OOV OOV , for two years now .
It OOV a number of OOV for OOV workers , as well as - and Mr OOV mentioned OOV OOV - a whole OOV of OOV which make OOV more OOV , OOV and more OOV .
The Council must do something about this ; Parliament has OOV rights on this OOV .
However , the Council must OOV OOV , and I hope that something can be done there .
<P> OOV , in my opinion , the Commission should be more OOV when it OOV to all OOV OOV OOV which are being OOV , in order to OOV whether the OOV , OOV OOV law should be OOV into OOV with social security in the country of employment , are being OOV .
This is to OOV problems OOV and to OOV people from OOV between two OOV .
As far as this is concerned , the Commission should get its OOV together a OOV more , and OOV and OOV the OOV OOV OOV more , also in the OOV OOV .
<P> The OOV point I want to make concerns OOV OOV , or the OOV of OOV from OOV for OOV OOV in another Member State .
Court OOV have been OOV on this .
This is another area where OOV have OOV themselves down .
There are OOV of the Court of OOV , OOV being the most OOV , and I know a few people from my own region , which is a OOV region , who OOV to Court .
Mr President , OOV the Member States OOV the Commission have OOV OOV any OOV to Parliament on this matter .
That is OOV .
We should not OOV OOV in the OOV of the OOV ; we as OOV must be able to do something about this .
I know very well that when the OOV Commissioner , Mr OOV , was in OOV , a OOV was being OOV .
I know that the OOV of this was OOV to be OOV .
But it does OOV that for once - and I would like to OOV the Commission in this respect - we had OOV and OOV .
The position of OOV OOV workers , but also that of OOV OOV workers is at OOV here .
As far as OOV is concerned , it OOV to all people who OOV OOV the OOV .
<P> I would ask the OOV to vote in favour of the report and certainly also for the amendments which I have OOV .
The reason for this is that OOV work is no OOV a problem of the OOV Union of the OOV .
It OOV on the OOV OOV of the market , also with regard to the OOV countries .
I would therefore call for the OOV support possible .
<SPEAKER OOV LANGUAGE="DE " OOV " > Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , I would like to thank Mrs OOV for OOV the situation OOV by OOV workers in an OOV report from Parliament .
OOV and OOV are the OOV and problems that we continue to OOV in the European OOV market , one of the OOV OOV of which is the OOV of OOV of OOV workers .
These are problems which OOV the people to question the OOV OOV ' OOV of the European Union .
<P> OOV an OOV in a region OOV OOV , OOV and OOV I can OOV with all the OOV of these issues .
OOV is a OOV OOV , who is OOV OOV , only OOV to have OOV to this for a OOV OOV of time when OOV in OOV ?
The OOV of a OOV in OOV is OOV OOV to OOV OOV for OOV second OOV , but not if OOV OOV OOV in OOV .
OOV it OOV for an OOV who is OOV in OOV to be OOV for in a OOV OOV OOV OOV OOV in OOV ?
OOV OOV OOV in OOV are subject to OOV OOV before they OOV the OOV OOV .
OOV why should an OOV OOV working in OOV OOV have to OOV OOV on his whole OOV , which he OOV in OOV , because he OOV an OOV OOV ?
OOV OOV are OOV against OOV OOV and OOV costs , and so OOV are at OOV .
This is why people OOV the OOV of OOV .
<P> The OOV OOV on .
OOV workers must be OOV , so as to be able to OOV with the OOV of OOV on both OOV of the OOV .
OOV who look for a OOV over the OOV within the European OOV market need legal OOV in a OOV Europe , particularly in the OOV of social legislation .
We OOV from the OOV regions in the European Union call upon the Commission and the Council , to provide for more OOV social OOV .
We have OOV a great deal , but there is still much to be done .
The report by Mrs OOV OOV the OOV OOV of the people in the OOV regions .
The OOV market must also be OOV within the OOV market if we want to make Europe an OOV whole .
<SPEAKER OOV OOV " OOV OOV " > Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I would like to OOV by OOV OOV OOV for the OOV cooperation we OOV within the framework of this report .
I OOV it was a OOV OOV to OOV down a number of OOV which this Parliament put forward in OOV further to an OOV report and following my own report which is OOV on a OOV workers OOV .
It has to be said : not a great deal has OOV OOV OOV over the OOV three years .
We have often said that OOV regions are good OOV for European OOV .
If this is the case , then I do not think OOV is in OOV good OOV these OOV , because , OOV for the European Court of OOV , OOV progress has been made .
<P> OOV , I also OOV the fact that the OOV OOV OOV has not even been OOV in the social OOV and that the Treaty of OOV has not made any decisions with regard to OOV OOV , which only OOV OOV .
<P> OOV , the world OOV on , and in all OOV of countries , OOV OOV are under way , social security legislation is in full OOV , OOV OOV are being OOV with OOV OOV , and quite a few countries , in a OOV to OOV work , OOV and OOV time , are OOV up with all OOV of OOV for OOV OOV which will only OOV to the country ' s own citizens and OOV not to OOV workers .
I am therefore in OOV agreement with the European Commission , which OOV to OOV an OOV into the OOV OOV OOV OOV , which - I OOV to say - does not OOV OOV citizens , OOV the OOV OOV does OOV to OOV .
<P> OOV workers have an OOV OOV OOV to other citizens who OOV themselves of the OOV OOV of OOV principle .
They often work in one country and OOV in another , and OOV OOV in one country and their social OOV in another .
OOV have some OOV between the OOV policy and social security system in one country would already be something , but to OOV this to OOV between countries is OOV OOV of OOV .
As a result , OOV workers continue to be at the OOV end of this OOV situation .
OOV the most OOV European OOV OOV us OOV not OOV of a time when we could OOV achieve the OOV OOV of a OOV social security system or OOV OOV OOV Europe .
We must therefore look for OOV OOV .
<P> I would like to OOV two .
OOV of all , the OOV report is right to OOV new life into the OOV OOV on OOV OOV OOV reports on the part of the Member States in all OOV OOV which OOV to social security and OOV , with OOV for OOV workers to OOV out any OOV , a OOV which , in fact , is already being OOV in some countries , OOV with some OOV .
OOV , my group has some OOV with the fact that Mrs OOV OOV down the OOV at the time .
We believe that the OOV must OOV in place as a matter of OOV and that OOV must be made OOV .
<P> OOV , we must have the OOV to take the OOV OOV in OOV a OOV further .
We were OOV to OOV the OOV OOV for OOV workers at the time .
We must , at long last , OOV for one OOV principle , OOV in the country of OOV or the country of employment .
I think there is a whole OOV of OOV in favour of the country of employment .
I think that , OOV , my group will be OOV against the amendments OOV by Mrs OOV and against those of Mr OOV who OOV to OOV this principle .
<P> I hope that this report will OOV from the OOV OOV and that OOV workers can at long last make some more OOV .
<SPEAKER OOV OOV " NAME=" OOV " > Mr President , I would like to thank Mrs OOV for the OOV OOV of work OOV has done .
OOV , OOV , has also OOV that this is an important issue for which OOV is being done , for which OOV OOV have any OOV , and , as we can see , it is extremely difficult to OOV this matter some OOV .
<P> OOV this , I have some OOV in this respect , which is also OOV from my amendments .
I , OOV , OOV in a OOV region and every OOV , I see people from my area who OOV to another country .
OOV this is OOV or OOV , they OOV the OOV at any OOV .
<P> What I have OOV is that the OOV on social security , No OOV , also OOV to workers who OOV to OOV to the country of employment and actually OOV there .
I welcome OOV in this matter , and I have OOV two amendments to this OOV .
I agree with this position and I have also OOV Mrs OOV .
But I do believe that we should OOV a OOV so that , if it OOV that after OOV OOV or two years , an OOV should be made and if , OOV on this OOV , it OOV that OOV workers are OOV OOV OOV , a different OOV can be made , and I would like to see this OOV OOV in the report .
<P> Mrs OOV OOV the country of employment as the OOV principle .
I believe that it is not so OOV that the country of employment principle always OOV in the interests of , and OOV , the OOV workers .
I am of the opinion that we work to OOV and not the other way OOV .
For that reason , I believe that all the OOV and OOV we OOV on the OOV OOV should be OOV to OOV in our OOV environment .
That is why I am in favour of OOV the OOV of OOV the country of OOV principle .
<P> I have OOV the OOV in an OOV .
I would therefore ask my OOV OOV to vote in favour of this OOV .
I have also OOV two amendments to OOV OOV and OOV to have these OOV , because I believe that the Commission is not OOV to take measures to OOV in OOV OOV .
<SPEAKER OOV NAME=" OOV " > Mr President , I also wish to thank Mrs OOV for OOV work on this issue .
I OOV many of OOV OOV and OOV about the OOV , implementation and OOV of change to OOV OOV .
<P> As a OOV of the Committee on OOV , it is clear to me that there is a OOV and OOV number of OOV , including OOV OOV and OOV workers , for OOV the current OOV are not working OOV .
OOV will make a OOV system of OOV even more OOV and it is not OOV that many citizens OOV do not believe that the Union OOV the OOV OOV of citizens as OOV as it OOV its OOV to the OOV OOV of OOV .
We have to find a way of OOV things for citizens themselves and for the OOV of these systems .
It would not be OOV if we were to OOV an OOV number of OOV for a OOV European OOV that would deal OOV with national OOV on the citizens ' behalf .
<P> The call for a directive OOV OOV OOV reports is to be OOV .
At least these would be OOV and could OOV deal with some of the problems before they OOV , which would make a OOV change .
It is also clear that as more countries OOV their OOV and social security systems , we need to take action to OOV the OOV OOV , which can result in OOV OOV .
However , the OOV issue is that Member States need to OOV their OOV to OOV OOV by OOV problems OOV and in a OOV which OOV OOV of the European Union .
<P> <SPEAKER OOV NAME=" President " > The debate is OOV OOV OOV OOV <P> We shall now OOV to the vote .
<P> <SPEAKER OOV NAME=" OOV > Mr President , on a point of order .
As more and more Members come into the OOV , I would like to OOV a welcome OOV .
We have today OOV a OOV OOV OOV the OOV , a OOV OOV place with OOV of good OOV .
I hope that all OOV who continue to OOV their health by OOV , will find themselves OOV OOV OOV the OOV and will OOV OOV in the OOV OOV .
I hope OOV has OOV that .
<P> <SPEAKER OOV NAME=" President " > OOV you , Mrs OOV , for OOV after the interests of OOV .
<SPEAKER OOV OOV " > Mr President , on a point of order .
I welcome the fact that there is now going to be a OOV rather than a OOV OOV .
I hope now that all Members and all OOV of OOV OOV the OOV areas OOV the whole of the European Parliament OOV .
I am still having problems being able to get into the OOV and being able to get in and out of committee OOV , both here and in OOV .
So I OOV with OOV , now there is a OOV area , to use it and not the OOV areas , including the OOV and going up to the OOV .
<SPEAKER OOV NAME=" OOV " > Mr President , on a point of order .
I was just OOV whether OOV is going to OOV the OOV of OOV where the OOV OOV and the OOV OOV are .
<SPEAKER OOV NAME=" President " > We shall now OOV to the vote .
OOV OOV OOV <SPEAKER OOV LANGUAGE="DE " NAME=" OOV " > Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , in OOV ' s debate , the Commission OOV why , and under what conditions , it can OOV Parliament ' s amendments .
OOV said that , the OOV of some of these amendments will have to be OOV because OOV they might not OOV with the OOV OOV and the OOV .
OOV OOV in the OOV are also necessary in order to ensure OOV with OOV OOV of the directive .
<SPEAKER OOV OOV " NAME=" President " > OOV and gentlemen , this is an OOV report in that the first OOV OOV place as long OOV as OOV OOV .

<P> OOV to OOV No OOV <P> OOV OOV OOV ( OOV , rapporteur .
( OOV ) Mr President , from a OOV point of view , this is an extremely OOV and OOV OOV .
However , I have OOV OOV against it , and I OOV to have the Commission ' s OOV on this , for as far as I OOV , this matter has already been OOV by the Commission and it is OOV out of the question that Europe should OOV OOV for OOV .
I OOV OOV against the OOV , because we are not out to OOV any OOV points in this OOV , but if the Commission could OOV this , we could then all vote against the OOV with a clear OOV .
<SPEAKER OOV LANGUAGE="DE " NAME=" OOV " > If the European Union were to support OOV OOV that had OOV OOV then of course this would be an OOV OOV OOV .
But the measures in the OOV OOV , which the EU is OOV in OOV , are to do with the infrastructure or OOV OOV , for example OOV for the OOV , which means that the OOV in its present form is not actually OOV and should therefore be OOV .
<P> However , I will of course use Mrs OOV OOV OOV s OOV as an opportunity to ask the services to OOV very OOV once again whether this OOV is indeed OOV .
<P> OOV to OOV OOV OOV OOV OOV ( OOV .
( OOV ) Mr President , this is a OOV OOV and it only OOV that we had OOV to OOV this report before now .
OOV is made to OOV , but since we are OOV the report today , this is a OOV OOV .
The OOV should therefore OOV as OOV : <P> " OOV the fact that it has OOV the OOV of Parliament to OOV OOV for the OOV of OOV OOV , including the OOV up of a OOV OOV , OOV OOV OOV , OOV rules of OOV and an OOV OOV has OOV in a proposal OOV to the OOV for OOV in OOV 2000 which OOV for implementation before OOV OOV OOV OOV

<P> OOV OOV OOV <P> OOV OOV for second OOV ( OOV ) <SPEAKER OOV OOV " NAME=" OOV " > Mr President , I was OOV I was going to have to make my OOV of vote in OOV .
I was concerned in case my OOV OOV OOV me from OOV .
However , I hope that I am not one who often OOV his OOV in it when he OOV his OOV and that I will be able to make my OOV contribution to the OOV .
<P> OOV then , I would like to OOV my support for the OOV report and call for a European OOV to be OOV in OOV .
In recent OOV , I am OOV to say , the OOV has OOV against the OOV and the OOV .
I would therefore like to take the opportunity OOV by this OOV of vote to OOV my OOV at the European OOV policy and to call for an increase in the European OOV 's OOV , including the OOV of OOV OOV Europe .
<SPEAKER OOV LANGUAGE="DE " OOV " > Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , OOV , OOV No OOV to the OOV directive on the OOV and OOV up of OOV OOV has OOV OOV support .
This is extremely OOV because it will give OOV OOV the opportunity to OOV OOV to the general resources as a result , which will OOV that OOV OOV OOV for the OOV of the OOV will no OOV be OOV .
This is OOV .
<P> This , to my OOV , is reason enough to OOV this report .
That is what I have done , and I OOV that the Commission ' s common position in its present form OOV to OOV OOV support .
<SPEAKER OOV LANGUAGE="FR" NAME=" OOV , OOV and OOV " > The OOV of the Commission OOV is to OOV OOV ' rights in the OOV of the OOV up of OOV OOV OOV .
OOV OOV is there any specific OOV of the rights which the OOV of the OOV OOV in question OOV to have .
<P> A number of national OOV systems do OOV the OOV as OOV , but they are only , at best , OOV to the OOV of their OOV OOV .
They OOV no OOV , on the other hand , for the OOV of their OOV , OOV OOV . the OOV of their future OOV , even OOV there are OOV to OOV that OOV will OOV OOV for the OOV they are OOV , in other words their OOV , the OOV of their future OOV .
<P> OOV OOV no responsibility in the OOV of OOV or OOV OOV since they have had no part in taking decisions .
They are the OOV that should be OOV first and OOV for the OOV of their OOV .
<P> We OOV against this OOV which is concerned only with OOV OOV , and not with the OOV who do the work of OOV these OOV OOV .
<P> OOV OOV OOV for second OOV ( OOV ) <SPEAKER OOV OOV " NAME=" OOV " > Mr President , I OOV for the OOV OOV report .
A few OOV OOV , I was the OOV of a OOV of the third OOV , where people go because they want to OOV rather then OOV to get a OOV .
These OOV are , of course , OOV by many OOV people .
The OOV of this OOV - the OOV of the third OOV of OOV , where I OOV - was OOV the fact that there is no OOV OOV or quality OOV of OOV of the third OOV .
OOV said to me : " OOV OOV are OOV OOV , but OOV is well OOV .
OOV , you should OOV in your OOV of vote that it would be as well for some interest to be taken in the quality of OOV of the third OOV too " .
<SPEAKER OOV LANGUAGE="FR" NAME=" OOV , OOV and OOV " > We certainly have OOV against " European cooperation in quality OOV of OOV education " , but it is a well OOV fact that the quality of education OOV on the resources made available to state OOV .
<P> In order to provide OOV education , we need OOV OOV of OOV , OOV with OOV OOV OOV and a great many OOV OOV , OOV and OOV and OOV OOV at all OOV of education , OOV with OOV OOV .
OOV Europe , OOV start to OOV at OOV level , OOV OOV from working OOV areas to OOV OOV in their education at this OOV in an often OOV way .
<P> In order to OOV towards OOV in Europe , we first need to OOV OOV with the countries that OOV the most resources to education .
OOV in those countries , however , there is a OOV to OOV back on the resources OOV to education and , more OOV , to public services in favour of other OOV OOV , OOV aid and OOV given to OOV or , rather , their OOV .
<P> If the resources OOV to education are not OOV OOV the European Union , especially in those that have the OOV OOV of OOV , the European OOV on quality of education will OOV a OOV hope .
<SPEAKER OOV NAME=" OOV " > .
The main OOV of this report OOV to the need for greater European cooperation in OOV the quality of education within our OOV OOV systems in the EU This could OOV quite a OOV OOV because different EU OOV can OOV OOV from OOV OOV OOV programmes that have been OOV and OOV within the OOV system in Europe .
<P> We should also OOV that this is now even more important in OOV of the new information society that is now upon us .
EU OOV in OOV last year OOV down a framework of proposals OOV OOV in the use of the OOV would be OOV to all OOV and OOV OOV OOV the European Union .
This is a OOV important social and economic OOV if the European Union is to take OOV of new OOV and OOV OOV OOV .
<P> The OOV is that new information OOV are OOV all the time .
This means that OOV OOV in the field of information OOV is also OOV all the time .
That is why the European Union must OOV in a OOV and OOV OOV so as to OOV that the best OOV OOV in the field of information OOV are available to all our OOV .
This will ensure a OOV quality of education and will also ensure that a OOV OOV is OOV to OOV new information OOV OOV to be set up and OOV within the OOV of the European Union .
<P> OOV in the field of education has been a OOV OOV within the European Union in recent years .
OOV , OOV countries OOV in the OOV programme , including countries from OOV and OOV Europe .
OOV OOV OOV OOV OOV from this initiative on an OOV basis .
OOV I welcome the OOV OOV of the OOV initiative , I would OOV that there is certainly OOV for OOV in the OOV in which this OOV is OOV now within the European Union .
OOV OOV are OOV financial problems OOV OOV OOV .
I do not support a system of OOV between the OOV of OOV available to OOV from the various Member States OOV in the OOV programme .
I would OOV OOV the OOV OOV from within the EU to put in place a system which OOV any OOV of OOV with regard to the OOV of the OOV programme .
<P> We should OOV that it is a very good policy of the European Union to OOV OOV to OOV in other EU Member States .
This OOV real and OOV OOV for OOV to improve their OOV OOV OOV OOV OOV the OOV OOV of OOV OOV the OOV
<P> OOV OOV report ( OOV ) <SPEAKER OOV LANGUAGE="DE " OOV " > Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I OOV in favour of Mrs OOV OOV s report , not just because I feel it is very positive and OOV , but because we are going to have to OOV a great deal more attention to this OOV in future .
I also believe that not only do we need to OOV the necessary public OOV , as OOV for in this report , we must also make more OOV available , so as to achieve the necessary level of OOV OOV the general public for these areas .
<P> A great deal still OOV to be done , but we are on the right OOV .
That is why I OOV in favour .
<SPEAKER OOV OOV " NAME=" OOV " > Mr President , I OOV against this report .
OOV why did the OOV ' OOV vote against Mrs OOV OOV 's report ?
OOV , before I OOV for OOV , I OOV a OOV Member of the European Parliament , Mrs OOV OOV , who is very OOV OOV with cultural issues .
OOV we were OOV this report over a good OOV in a OOV , OOV said to me : " OOV is it that this report OOV to OOV the number of cultural OOV OOV in OOV ?
It ' s not the OOV but the quality of OOV that OOV .
It is OOV our OOV that OOV has so many OOV OOV to OOV .
<SPEAKER OOV OOV NAME=" OOV " > Mrs OOV OOV 's report OOV OOV and OOV certain OOV proposals , which is why the OOV of the OOV OOV of OOV OOV in favour of it .
<P> However , we OOV that these proposals will OOV on OOV OOV .
We all know that our cultural and OOV heritage OOV being OOV out by OOV which OOV or OOV the OOV and local OOV in which OOV OOV of our cultural and OOV heritage are to be OOV .
OOV and OOV use of OOV , OOV OOV up in OOV OOV OOV , in the OOV and in OOV OOV and the OOV of any OOV measures to OOV OOV and the OOV environment are OOV of our OOV of the OOV and cultural OOV .
<P> OOV course , this is not the OOV work of a few OOV , it is the OOV OOV of a policy which OOV OOV and is OOV OOV by the OOV OOV .
A OOV example is the OOV OOV OOV in OOV , in OOV , OOV OOV , the OOV of OOV , where the OOV has been OOV and OOV have been put at OOV .
As if that were not enough , the OOV in the area have been OOV through the OOV and OOV for OOV to OOV their OOV and OOV environment .
We could OOV OOV other OOV in OOV with the OOV OOV or which it is OOV to OOV in order to OOV the OOV OOV in OOV in OOV .
<P> OOV only does the European Union do OOV to OOV and deal with these OOV ; on the OOV , it is the main OOV of this policy .
It funds OOV on OOV OOV which will OOV and OOV OOV OOV - OOV the case of the OOV OOV .
The OOV Government is OOV OOV OOV of the OOV as we OOV , OOV OOV what OOV OOV OOV there was for OOV and without the OOV OOV on the part of the OOV
<P> The OOV has a OOV for OOV OOV about OOV , but OOV it OOV that cultural heritage is a OOV OOV in the OOV OOV and OOV development of a society , it has done OOV to get the OOV OOV OOV to the OOV and OOV OOV of which they form an OOV part , even as a OOV of respect for our cultural and OOV heritage and for the need to OOV OOV OOV .
It is also OOV to the fact that OOV in OOV OOV are being OOV and OOV by the OOV OOV OOV .
Finally , it OOV a OOV responsibility for the OOV of OOV during the OOV OOV against OOV .
<P> This situation cannot be OOV with OOV measures or OOV OOV or , of course , within the OOV of a market OOV .
We need to OOV the OOV , all the cultural OOV , all the workers , and we need to OOV a different policy , one which OOV the working OOV and the OOV of his OOV .
<SPEAKER OOV NAME=" OOV " > .
The OOV Group OOV that the OOV OOV report is a very important contribution to better OOV of world cultural and OOV heritage .
<P> We are of the opinion that the OOV of the OOV for the OOV of the OOV OOV and OOV OOV in the EU is a OOV for Member States rather than for the European Community .
It is difficult for us to see the OOV OOV of EU OOV in this matter .
The OOV amendments to the OOV OOV report OOV this position .
<P> OOV , for OOV of OOV of OOV OOV and the principle of OOV the OOV Group will OOV in the OOV vote .
<SPEAKER OOV LANGUAGE="FR" NAME=" OOV " > OOV and OOV our heritage in each Member State is OOV important as , in so OOV , we are OOV our OOV and OOV OOV OOV still OOV OOV .
<P> OOV heritage , be it cultural , OOV , economic or OOV , is the OOV of our OOV and in OOV it we are not OOV a OOV action .
On the OOV , it OOV that we are OOV for our future .
The OOV OOV OOV OOV that the only OOV OOV of progress are those who take a OOV respect for the OOV as their OOV point .
<P> We must , therefore , take OOV of the OOV of our OOV , our heritage , our OOV and our OOV , even the very OOV , in order to OOV for the future .
This cultural OOV and OOV will OOV us to OOV a better OOV of OOV .
OOV achieve this , however , we must respect all the OOV of our various OOV , all our OOV , and the only way to do this is to OOV the OOV principle .
<P> In OOV with this principle we can OOV , OOV and OOV our heritage , OOV and OOV .
OOV these OOV or OOV OOV ( in the way of OOV , OOV life and OOV OOV ) we are OOV the OOV of OOV by which we hand down our OOV and our way of life and this OOV about cultural OOV .
At the end of the OOV , we will OOV a OOV into which OOV has to OOV in order to OOV in an OOV but more OOV society that can be OOV by OOV and OOV ' .
That is OOV .
<P> OOV , to OOV , OOV and OOV our heritage , we must OOV our OOV , support our OOV and OOV industry , OOV and OOV the OOV of our OOV , but I would like to OOV that we must not OOV it in OOV OOV or OOV the cultural OOV and OOV which are OOV there .
In so OOV , we must also respect the right to be different and help to OOV all these OOV since OOV life has its own OOV place in this OOV OOV society .
<P> OOV , to come back to the report , it is , of course , important to OOV the heritage of both the European Union and third countries , but it is OOV important and OOV to OOV the heritage of our own countries and regions .
We are therefore OOV to OOV the proposals to take our heritage into account in the various OOV programmes set up to OOV and OOV our heritage .
The same OOV for OOV and support of the OOV and OOV industry , a sector which OOV many OOV , as long as it is not OOV by OOV OOV OOV , as has been possible for market OOV .
<P> We must however state our OOV OOV the European OOV which , on the OOV of environmental OOV ( a OOV OOV too OOV ) , will OOV only to OOV out local OOV and OOV that are a OOV part of the local OOV of our regions .
OOV , this is the OOV of what this report OOV out to achieve and so , although we support the report , we are OOV from the vote for this reason .
<SPEAKER OOV OOV " NAME=" OOV " > OOV OOV , when the OOV OOV OOV adopted the OOV OOV the OOV of the OOV OOV and OOV OOV , which has already been OOV by OOV countries , including the OOV Member States of the European Union , OOV OOV have been OOV to the world heritage OOV , OOV % of which are in European Union countries ( OOV ) , and of those OOV are in OOV .
<P> It is OOV , however , that OOV OOV as world heritage OOV is not enough .
OOV OOV must be taken to support their OOV , including financial measures , as we have done with the proposals that we have OOV for the Community OOV .
<P> As the rapporteur OOV , there is an OOV between European countries and the OOV of the world with regard to OOV OOV and cultural OOV , and therefore third countries must be OOV and OOV , in a OOV approach , to OOV to the OOV of OOV and cultural heritage , so that they can be OOV OOV .
<P> It is also important for Member States to OOV with OOV OOV , and in particular the environmental OOV OOV directive on OOV the OOV of specific public and OOV OOV on cultural and OOV heritage , as the report OOV .
<SPEAKER OOV LANGUAGE="ES " NAME=" OOV OOV OOV " > OOV vote in support of the OOV OOV report on the OOV of the OOV OOV the OOV of the OOV OOV and OOV OOV in the Member States of the European Union is OOV on the OOV that we must OOV the cultural OOV of the European Union .
We must work to ensure we have a cultural policy in the Union which OOV , OOV the main OOV of its OOV OOV and that of the OOV OOV , its cultural , OOV , OOV and OOV OOV and all those OOV that make up our common cultural heritage .
This is clear when you OOV OOV the Union and see how the OOV OOV OOV over the OOV have been OOV in our OOV , OOV OOV , OOV systems , OOV and OOV OOV , and OOV of OOV and OOV OOV .
In OOV , and in OOV with the OOV , we must go OOV with our European cultural policy , OOV and OOV our cultural OOV , a OOV which in OOV OOV the European Union .
The OOV OOV report is a OOV contribution towards this .
<P> OOV report ( OOV ) <SPEAKER OOV OOV " NAME=" OOV " > Mr President , I am OOV you will OOV OOV to my OOV of vote in support of this report .
I am in favour of OOV which OOV or OOV , OOV that the process is not too OOV for those OOV the OOV and is OOV out OOV .
I therefore OOV that , in this OOV of OOV and OOV Community legislation on the social security OOV sector - to which this report OOV - we must OOV in OOV that it would be appropriate for workers who work in more than one State of the European Union to OOV a OOV OOV from a OOV OOV OOV rather than part of it from one State , part of it from another State and part of it from yet another .
<SPEAKER OOV NAME=" President " > OOV you Mr OOV .
The more I OOV to you the more I OOV that I will know your life OOV before long .
<SPEAKER OOV LANGUAGE="FR" NAME=" OOV , OOV and OOV " > OOV that we are OOV to a market OOV , we shall not OOV any position on the OOV OOV of the OOV market .
We are therefore OOV from the vote on this report .
<P> However , on the OOV that may OOV the OOV of the OOV OOV OOV . the workers , we are in favour of : <P> OOV social legislation and social security by OOV them into OOV with countries that have the most OOV OOV for workers ; <P> OOV OOV through the OOV OOV of both OOV itself and all OOV OOV , which are particularly OOV as they OOV OOV OOV OOV OOV , and OOV these with a OOV increase in OOV OOV and a OOV OOV OOV on all OOV of OOV from OOV .
<P> OOV OOV OOV report ( OOV ) <SPEAKER OOV OOV " NAME=" OOV " > Mr President , I OOV for the OOV OOV OOV report .
OOV you for your OOV words just now .
In OOV for the OOV , I would like to OOV your attention to the part of the OOV which OOV to OOV to the Palestinian authorities .
I was OOV to do so by the OOV of the OOV ' OOV in OOV - for the OOV OOV OOV of the OOV ' OOV in OOV - one of OOV said to me : " I am OOV you are OOV the OOV .
In fact , you should give them more and better OOV and ensure that it OOV OOV to help the Palestinian people , for they OOV need it .
OOV , I am OOV that , if the Palestinian citizens were in better health and their OOV were OOV , there would be less OOV than I am OOV to say there is at the OOV " .
<SPEAKER OOV LANGUAGE="FR" NAME=" OOV and OOV " > I am OOV to agree with my group OOV its position on Mr OOV OOV ' s OOV , which I , OOV , OOV to support .
<P> It is one OOV for the issue of the OOV of OOV OOV by Palestinian OOV not to be OOV in the OOV OOV resolution .
I would say that this is a OOV problem .
However , to my OOV , it is a OOV political OOV for us to OOV it for this reason OOV , OOV OOV . on the OOV of form rather than OOV .
<P> OOV OOV the OOV OOV , the European Union and its Member States have , to a great OOV , OOV the Palestinian education system .
OOV , it is up to us to OOV that the Commission should OOV more OOV to ensure that the OOV in Palestinian OOV does not OOV an OOV to OOV , OOV and OOV OOV .
<P> The European Union cannot OOV OOV OOV OOV and peace OOV OOV to OOV a OOV OOV to the way EU financial support is being OOV for OOV OOV .
OOV , I OOV hope that this issue will very OOV be the subject of a OOV debate in Parliament .
<P> We must be OOV on this issue .
OOV OOV will not OOV OOV OOV , OOV will our OOV .
<SPEAKER OOV LANGUAGE="SV" NAME=" OOV " > I have OOV in favour of the report and especially of OOV No OOV from Mr OOV OOV .
<P> It is important for the European Parliament to OOV OOV the OOV OOV in OOV resources for Palestinian OOV and for Parliament to call upon the Commission to ensure that the aid given to Palestinian education does not , OOV OOV or OOV , OOV OOV OOV .
OOV , the OOV s contribution to the Palestinian education system should OOV OOV peace and OOV in the OOV OOV .
<P> EU aid must , as far as possible , be OOV to OOV about peace and OOV in the OOV OOV .
The EU is , OOV other things , OOV aid to the Palestinian education system .
It is OOV OOV and OOV that Palestinian OOV OOV should OOV OOV OOV and OOV OOV - the only democracy in the OOV OOV - in terms as OOV as those of OOV .
<SPEAKER OOV OOV OOV OOV " > .
OOV the rapporteur and the OOV Group OOV the OOV OOV in OOV No OOV OOV concern at the possible use made of EU financial support for OOV OOV OOV OOV OOV against their OOV OOV .
<P> The OOV OOV Committee is OOV in the OOV of a OOV OOV report to OOV itself to the OOV of the OOV OOV resolution for the year in question .
<P> This OOV OOV a new issue on OOV that has OOV come to OOV .
The rapporteur is therefore OOV that the OOV be OOV but that the matter be OOV with more fully in the OOV of the OOV OOV OOV report .
<P> OOV OOV report ( OOV ) <SPEAKER OOV NAME=" OOV " > Mr President , OOV have OOV attention to a number of problems , including OOV OOV .
I support their concern as it is OOV OOV that international OOV are now more OOV in OOV OOV than OOV as it is more OOV and less OOV .
We in the EU must OOV to this problem as a matter of OOV .
<P> The OOV from OOV OOV not only OOV the OOV of OOV but also OOV OOV to the EU , which would OOV be used in OOV OOV , OOV , the OOV of human rights , OOV .
In OOV , OOV OOV OOV greater OOV to health because of OOV OOV OOV , and we must OOV the support of OOV in national and regional OOV in any OOV against this .
<P> The Commission should OOV in particular the OOV of health and education in the OOV OOV OOV , OOV OOV OOV and Mr OOV OOV .
I OOV that because we use education and health programmes to OOV OOV and the OOV OOV OOV OOV the OOV OOV of the OOV in OOV OOV OOV .
They have OOV to that OOV .
What better way to OOV the OOV OOV than to OOV their OOV to OOV this OOV .
It also OOV a greater need for OOV OOV in OOV OOV .
<SPEAKER OOV OOV " NAME=" OOV " > Mr President , I OOV for this report but with great OOV .
OOV I OOV for OOV , I OOV Mr OOV , a OOV who is also from OOV , in a OOV .
We OOV about the OOV ' OOV and he OOV me whether I was OOV with the European Parliament .
I said : " It is such an OOV OOV OOV
I am OOV , I feel at OOV and I have some very good OOV .
OOV the OOV , such as Mr OOV , for example , are very OOV and I like them very much . "
OOV OOV : " OOV is OOV working OOV in Europe ?
You do OOV find OOV OOV European OOV every now and again ? " " OOV , I OOV , OOV is working OOV . "
However , I am OOV to say that I then OOV in this report that the national States have not OOV Community legislation on OOV OOV OOV to the Community OOV .
I therefore hope that , in future , the OOV of OOV OOV in Europe will work well too .
<SPEAKER OOV OOV NAME=" OOV , OOV and OOV " > We have OOV in favour of a report on OOV and OOV for OOV own resources .
The report as a whole OOV OOV .
There are , however , a few points from which we would OOV OOV .
OOV OOV and OOV OOV the way for OOV a OOV OOV OOV in the EU and for OOV OOV law and the OOV of OOV in the Member States .
OOV of all , this is OOV OOV .
OOV , we are not in favour of OOV OOV legislation and the OOV of OOV in the Member States .
What we do support is OOV the necessary OOV for OOV OOV OOV EU funds more OOV .
We are in favour of OOV the OOV OOV by OOV up a OOV under OOV to OOV OOV and make it OOV to OOV up OOV OOV in the national OOV .
The OOV must only concern itself with OOV OOV by EU OOV .
In the OOV OOV , OOV should be given to OOV a European public OOV to OOV up OOV of OOV OOV EU funds in the Member States .
We must not , however , have OOV for OOV ' s OOV and , in other areas , the Member States ' OOV law and OOV of OOV are national concerns .
<P> OOV report ( OOV ) <SPEAKER OOV OOV " NAME=" OOV " > Mr President , although I have OOV my OOV , I OOV to OOV that I OOV against the OOV report , which OOV with OOV and OOV OOV .
I am OOV to OOV the subject on this OOV because I want to call OOV for OOV help to be given to farmers - for this OOV does not provide OOV OOV for them - and , in particular , because I want to OOV attention to the fact that there is OOV a OOV OOV in OOV over OOV and other OOV .
OOV only is there OOV of OOV OOV OOV , OOV , but , since OOV , there has also been OOV of OOV OOV " in OOV .
OOV are OOV that it might be possible to OOV OOV OOV OOV by OOV OOV .
This is a OOV OOV OOV to say , and it would be appropriate for the European Union to OOV and make it clear that OOV is not OOV but quite OOV .
<SPEAKER OOV OOV " NAME=" OOV " > This report is OOV OOV in its OOV of various OOV of the OOV
For example , the approach adopted in its OOV OOV OOV concerns , for example , when the report OOV OOV at the OOV OOV OOV OOV and OOV OOV , and OOV on a greater OOV of OOV OOV , without even OOV the OOV this will have for farmers ' OOV .
OOV , together with the principle of OOV , it OOV the OOV of OOV costs .
This is a principle that we OOV .
<P> The report also OOV OOV at the Commission ' s decision to OOV out a OOV OOV of the OOV in OOV , which OOV OOV a Court of OOV ' opinion OOV the system of OOV OOV and OOV in these OOV down in OOV 2000 , OOV that , OOV some OOV in the OOV of OOV , such as that OOV by OOV , this system still OOV to OOV a OOV of OOV as OOV OOV and OOV .
<P> OOV regard to the OOV sector and OOV OOV , the report OOV by OOV and OOV the proposal to OOV funds with OOV from the OOV themselves or other OOV of OOV OOV , which is a OOV OOV in OOV to the opinion that has already been OOV in the OOV report , which OOV in favour of such OOV funds .
<P> OOV , I agree with the rapporteur when he OOV a very important issue OOV the system of OOV OOV , which is the OOV of aid OOV major OOV and in the most OOV regions .
What is OOV is an OOV in the situation of small OOV , OOV support OOV to the OOV of the OOV .
It is OOV to OOV how the rapporteur OOV to support small farmers through the measures that he is OOV .
<P> OOV report ( OOV ) <P> President .
Mr OOV , if you want to OOV OOV we will just OOV going as you are the only OOV OOV .

<P> OOV regard to my OOV of vote on the OOV OOV , which concerns the Committee on OOV OOV and , in particular , the way in which the aid to OOV and OOV has been OOV , I have to say that I have had a meeting with the OOV of the OOV of that region .
They OOV me to ask the European Parliament - and I am very OOV to do so on this OOV - to ensure that at least part of the aid , by some means or other , OOV the OOV people of OOV and OOV .
" But we OOV OOV go OOV up on what OOV to our OOV , I OOV .
" But you must , Mr OOV .
You must OOV that the funds are OOV when they OOV their OOV as well .
We OOV need to OOV some of them OOV " <SPEAKER OOV NAME=" OOV " > Mr President , there is indeed a OOV of OOV in OOV as Mr OOV with his OOV as a OOV OOV well .
<P> If this OOV is particularly OOV in Mr OOV 's own Member State , it is the OOV result of OOV OOV by OOV OOV over the OOV OOV years , and to OOV it the United OOV must OOV the OOV of the OOV OOV for its contribution to European Union OOV .
This has been OOV for OOV .
OOV , the rapporteur , a OOV of the OOV OOV , must work within his own OOV to OOV support for his proposals in the House of OOV .
<P> In countries where less than OOV % of the OOV now OOV in OOV areas , it is too OOV for OOV to OOV the needs of these areas , and the OOV from this debate must be that they do so at the OOV of their countries .
<SPEAKER OOV OOV OOV " > .
( OOV ) OOV military OOV - OOV for the OOV of peace OOV OOV OOV ' OOV OOV OOV OOV , OOV by OOV , OOV financial OOV ' for the OOV of OOV peace ' : such are the EU 's OOV in the case of OOV and OOV , OOV and the OOV in general , which have been OOV for years now as the result of the OOV military and political OOV interests being OOV out in this region .
<P> This OOV report OOV OOV how the OOV OOV is OOV and OOV how the EU OOV ' OOV is being OOV , with no OOV or OOV , in order to OOV the OOV of the OOV interests of the EU in the OOV OOV of OOV , OOV of OOV and OOV ' OOV OOV .
OOV to OOV , OOV , OOV OOV , OOV of OOV being OOV for OOV OOV , OOV and OOV OOV both in the OOV report and the OOV .
They OOV the OOV situation in the OOV of terms and OOV the OOV OOV about support for the civil society and the OOV of democracy .
What could be more OOV than the OOV in the report to " OOV of interest " in the OOV of the OOV OOV OOV ?
<P> We are not OOV that those who OOV ' peace with depleted uranium OOV , OOV OOV and OOV , cannot and will not OOV the role of OOV .
We are not OOV that the OOV OOV is being OOV OOV by the major economic interests which OOV , OOV and OOV the OOV between the OOV of this region and by the OOV and OOV of those interests , such as the OOV Mr OOV .
<P> But we are OOV by the OOV and OOV of OOV who continue to OOV of efforts to OOV up ' and improve the OOV of funds and OOV the OOV of law .
The OOV OOV OOV for themselves and OOV no OOV for OOV , OOV OOV OOV .
OOV are not OOV ; their OOV cannot be OOV OOV and however much you OOV to OOV the OOV , you still have to OOV with the people .
<P> We shall not be OOV in favour of the OOV report , OOV the fact that it OOV OOV OOV OOV and proposals , because its general OOV is OOV of any OOV of OOV to the OOV of OOV OOV and its only concern is how to OOV that OOV so that it is OOV for the people to OOV .
<P> OOV report ( OOV ) <SPEAKER OOV OOV " NAME=" OOV " > Mr President , I OOV for the OOV report , but I want to OOV that OOV this vote for the OOV is my position as OOV of the OOV ' OOV .
I wish to make clear my OOV OOV to the now OOV OOV of OOV that the OOV OOV and European aid are OOV to national aid .
So the OOV OOV should be OOV aid ?
I OOV .
I feel that European funds should have OOV OOV to do with national OOV or national OOV .
European funds must not be OOV to national funds .
Europe is a OOV OOV from its OOV OOV .
<SPEAKER OOV OOV " NAME=" OOV " > Mr President , first of all , I should like to OOV Mr OOV OOV on the fact that he has OOV a report which is OOV on the farmers ' OOV , the OOV in OOV areas , and not on the view from OOV .
This in itself OOV a OOV contribution to agricultural policy .
<P> But if we now OOV the situation , we could ask OOV whether there are any young people OOV out there who are OOV enough to become farmers in the European Union .
What we need is people who want to take up the OOV of OOV an OOV OOV , OOV OOV as it were , but not OOV through OOV OOV .
<P> They OOV to be OOV a OOV OOV , if we consider the OOV which young farmers OOV , as well as the OOV they are OOV to OOV .
OOV OOV just one example - and I am just OOV my own country for a OOV - OOV OOV is a sector where OOV OOV is being OOV , from the OOV of OOV right up to the OOV that the OOV OOV the OOV .
I cannot help OOV a OOV with OOV farmers and OOV who have been OOV to OOV OOV on the OOV of their OOV on the environment and OOV OOV for a long time , and do so with great OOV .
At the same time , we have to say that in many European countries the OOV for OOV OOV are OOV the world ' s most OOV .
<P> So OOV OOV to become a OOV in Europe must OOV their OOV OOV in the world .
They need to give the OOV and cultural conditions OOV OOV .
They must OOV the OOV OOV conditions , OOV a OOV OOV of OOV , both OOV and in terms of quality , make OOV OOV a OOV priority and be responsible for the OOV , even once it has OOV the OOV .
This is what we call social OOV as a OOV OOV .
It OOV OOV , a OOV of OOV and the environment , social OOV and OOV .
For this reason OOV , it would be OOV if a specific policy were set up for young farmers which is OOV on the future .
OOV of the OOV points could OOV a OOV OOV OOV to quality , OOV and environmental OOV , but also the OOV of an OOV in other economic OOV , not OOV by the farmers but by the OOV , to OOV those OOV OOV which farmers need to OOV , and to OOV the market position of farmers and OOV .
<P> What OOV me in the European Union ' s OOV policy as a whole , is that although it is OOV a great deal of attention , in the OOV sector , for example , the OOV , the OOV that is , are OOV OOV a OOV position , and that at the same time OOV from OOV , the OOV OOV , are still OOV .
In that OOV , it would be OOV if both OOV OOV and OOV were more OOV in their OOV of this area in terms of OOV .
<P> Mr President , OOV can OOV for one OOV without OOV ; it is life OOV number one .
This OOV OOV OOV .
This means that OOV does not just OOV for market OOV , but also for public health , OOV and OOV .
In OOV , if we OOV this , then we will know that , in future , young farmers will need to be OOV OOV , and in that OOV , OOV more support , more political support than they are OOV at the OOV .
<P> OOV OOV report ( OOV ) <SPEAKER OOV OOV " NAME=" OOV " > Mr President , the OOV report , which I OOV in favour of , is a report on the OOV of the European OOV OOV and therefore on the situation of the OOV .
I have already had OOV to OOV the European OOV OOV , in other words , the OOV , on its OOV in OOV in recent OOV , but today I would like to call for the OOV of a European OOV .
The OOV - European OOV OOV - should be OOV to the European citizens as an OOV OOV , a OOV OOV as well .
I therefore OOV that my OOV will be OOV upon .
<SPEAKER OOV LANGUAGE="FR" OOV and OOV > The report by Mr OOV OOV two issues .
In the OOV of OOV OOV , it OOV OOV OOV OOV to some OOV OOV , which is OOV .
On the other hand , the rapporteur OOV the OOV for OOV OOV , the European OOV OOV , from OOV out its work .
We OOV therefore that " the European OOV OOV has OOV that it will not OOV the European OOV OOV , OOV , to OOV OOV OOV " and that OOV its first report to Parliament , Council and Commission , the OOV committee of OOV OOV for legal OOV to be OOV against Community OOV that have not OOV OOV OOV , before the end of OOV " and that " the Commission OOV legal OOV at the European Court of OOV against the decision of OOV OOV OOV of the European OOV OOV OOV the OOV of Parliament and Council OOV OOV " .
<P> We believe that this whole issue is extremely important and we support the OOV of the report which OOV clear OOV between the public OOV OOV by the OOV in its OOV OOV report to OOV OOV cooperation with OOV and the decision by the OOV itself to OOV OOV from OOV over OOV OOV , OOV the OOV by the European Court of OOV " .
We will vote in support of the report by Mr OOV for this reason .
<P> OOV report ( OOV ) <SPEAKER OOV OOV " NAME=" OOV " > Mr President , I could not OOV to give an OOV of vote on my OOV , Mr OOV ' report , upon which I have already OOV during the debate .
This time , however , I would like to state that my vote for the OOV is also a call for Mr OOV to OOV , at a OOV OOV , an OOV which I OOV and which , I OOV to say , has been OOV this time .
I am OOV , that is , for funds to be OOV to small and OOV OOV which OOV the OOV of OOV up a OOV where a young OOV who is full of OOV and the will to work is OOV by an OOV - OOV - OOV who OOV OOV there is to know about the OOV , is very OOV and can OOV on his OOV , and , even OOV he has no real wish to work long OOV , would be OOV to give the OOV the OOV of his OOV .
<SPEAKER OOV OOV OOV " > The Members of the OOV OOV of OOV will be OOV against the OOV report because the specific " OOV on financial OOV for OOV and OOV OOV and OOV OOV ( OOV ) " OOV in the report form part of the more general policy OOV by the OOV and the EU against OOV , to which there are three OOV : <P> OOV OOV support for a small group of what are - by OOV OOV - OOV and OOV OOV , with a view to OOV their OOV role OOV the OOV and OOV the OOV used to OOV OOV and OOV .
<P> OOV OOV OOV terms for the OOV OOV of the OOV small and OOV OOV , in a OOV to OOV the same OOV by the back OOV .
<P> OOV In OOV to the OOV , it is clear from all the EU programmes on OOV that OOV OOV is OOV to OOV ' ( on to OOV ) the OOV which it is OOV to OOV as it OOV its OOV of the working OOV , OOV by OOV progress .
This OOV will be OOV by the OOV OOV in the OOV system and therefore has OOV OOV of OOV .
<P> It is also important to OOV that OOV OOV , not OOV as a whole , OOV from European programmes .
OOV OOV OOV only too well that a policy which OOV OOV as a whole would OOV an OOV to be OOV with .
OOV , even if OOV under European programmes OOV to OOV small OOV , they cannot be used to OOV , because each of these OOV is in an extremely OOV position on the OOV market .
<P> A number of OOV on the OOV of the specific programmes OOV out the general OOV made OOV : <P> OOV .
The OOV on the OOV OOV by these measures ( OOV OOV and up to OOV OOV OOV in OOV OOV ) clearly OOV what are OOV OOV by OOV OOV to OOV .
In fact , OOV % of OOV in OOV OOV up to OOV OOV and achieve OOV of up to OOV OOV million .
OOV this point of view , the concern about small OOV OOV in the OOV report is OOV .
<P> OOV The OOV number of OOV OOV by these measures is OOV OOV with the OOV number of OOV in the OOV : OOV OOV out of a OOV of some OOV million OOV in the OOV or OOV % of the OOV number over a OOV of two years from OOV .
<P> OOV The OOV OOV out by the European funds in OOV is OOV OOV and does not OOV to a real policy for the OOV of OOV .
A OOV of EUR OOV million has been OOV out ( OOV OOV OOV ) or EUR OOV ( OOV OOV OOV ) OOV OOV .
<P> OOV . The results of this policy are even OOV : OOV OOV new OOV were OOV OOV , OOV with OOV million OOV in the OOV , at a OOV of EUR OOV OOV ( OOV OOV million ) each .
<P> OOV . OOV % of OOV which OOV from these measures come under the third OOV of the programmes , OOV OOV . the OOV OOV OOV for OOV for which they themselves were OOV responsible .
<P> This OOV the question of how a OOV OOV which OOV so much and OOV so OOV can be OOV as a OOV EU policy .
As far as OOV is concerned , it was OOV to be OOV in the programmes ; no OOV OOV OOV our way .
<P> We shall therefore be OOV against the report in question and the OOV Commission proposal .

OOV OOV OOV have , of course , been made to use OOV workers ' problems as a way in to OOV OOV legislation as a whole .
However , Mrs OOV OOV that OOV workers do not even OOV OOV a OOV OOV of the OOV OOV , that their problems are different from one OOV region to another and that different regional OOV are therefore OOV if OOV workers are to have a better time of it .
<P> I can OOV from OOV OOV , having OOV OOV years OOV between OOV and OOV .
We have now OOV a OOV between OOV and OOV , and OOV OOV a OOV increase in OOV OOV and for the two OOV to become a OOV It was here that , in OOV on the initiative of the OOV , the OOV principle was OOV of OOV people in the country in which they work .
This means that people can take up OOV in OOV and have OOV to health OOV , OOV OOV , education and OOV OOV , at the same time as OOV all their OOV to the OOV State .
That is quite OOV if we are to have a common OOV region .
<P> The OOV OOV by Swedish OOV is the OOV OOV for OOV OOV , which OOV that OOV should be OOV in the country of OOV .
That principle too OOV problems , however , because much more than OOV ' social OOV is OOV through OOV .
<P> For OOV in the OOV region , it would in OOV fact be best if we were to OOV local OOV where we OOV and State OOV where we work .
I think that would put an end to OOV OOV and to OOV in OOV regions .
However , a OOV such as that , too , would OOV some form of OOV OOV in order to OOV an OOV OOV situation , for these are OOV issues .
It is therefore OOV for OOV to be OOV out in the OOV regions themselves , and on the OOV principle that OOV workers must OOV OOV in the country in which they OOV their OOV OOV through OOV .
OOV in that way will OOV OOV be OOV .
It is OOV to OOV a principle of this OOV if OOV is to become a common region .
<SPEAKER OOV OOV " NAME=" OOV " > Mr President , as OOV of the OOV ' OOV , I would like to OOV my OOV OOV to the OOV of OOV , which has OOV OOV OOV and OOV of the European OOV of OOV Rights of the OOV and OOV with OOV into its own OOV .
I would also like to OOV on Mrs OOV 's report .
<P> I OOV the OOV of the report , particularly the part which OOV for an OOV of the OOV of OOV to the OOV of the Member States on OOV OOV , OOV to people who have OOV in more than one State , and especially that part of the OOV which concerns rules for the OOV of the OOV of people who have OOV in more than one State .
We are OOV the problems of OOV workers : of course we OOV to European Union workers but also , OOV , to relations between the States which have OOV themselves with OOV OOV , that is with the OOV - the European OOV OOV - in other words OOV and OOV .
I OOV to say that the OOV OOV and the OOV OOV have been OOV by the OOV Government , which has OOV OOV the OOV of people who have OOV in both OOV and OOV OOV to the OOV of OOV of OOV the OOV , that is a OOV of the OOV OOV , as OOV down by OOV OOV , OOV and OOV .
I call upon the European Parliament to OOV to OOV workers being OOV always to OOV legal OOV to OOV their rights .
<SPEAKER OOV LANGUAGE="FR" NAME=" OOV > Mr President , today we are OOV the situation of OOV workers , a OOV problem for the European Union , which has yet to find a OOV OOV .
Commissioner , Mr President , this situation OOV the people OOV and working on the OOV of the various European Union countries fully OOV the OOV of European OOV we OOV , even OOV these are the people who should be the first to OOV from it .
<P> We have a OOV in this House of OOV to the OOV the issue of OOV OOV of OOV and , OOV , of workers .
OOV , OOV there are still OOV to this , particularly in terms of OOV and social security , there are also other OOV to be OOV .
I believe that this issue is OOV with the OOV of OOV and OOV which we are OOV , even OOV we OOV able to find OOV good OOV to problems when it OOV to the OOV OOV of OOV and of OOV .
This OOV a major OOV to the principle of the OOV OOV of OOV and the OOV of OOV on OOV of OOV .
<P> In my opinion , this report is a real OOV OOV in OOV to OOV reports .
We should at least ensure that there is no need to OOV many more reports .
<P> We must OOV the Member States of their OOV and ask them to OOV a OOV OOV of OOV which result in OOV systems which have an OOV OOV on the situation of OOV workers .
We agree with the general OOV of the report but the OOV of certain amendments OOV down the OOV which we should be OOV .
OOV OOV , which , for example , OOV to OOV or social security , should be OOV OOV and it is OOV not a matter of taking OOV OOV into account .
<P> Mr President , I would like to OOV up by OOV that an OOV OOV should be OOV , OOV OOV OOV OOV to OOV , or even OOV but also one which would make it possible to OOV down on the OOV which OOV at present .
We OOV the Council ' s OOV in this area .
<SPEAKER OOV OOV NAME=" OOV " > Mr President , I should also like to thank Mrs OOV for OOV OOV report .
I think it only right that we in Parliament make efforts to OOV the problems OOV by OOV workers .
I am OOV with the problems from OOV OOV , where it is OOV OOV how few people OOV on one OOV of the OOV OOV and work on the other OOV .
I think this OOV how major the OOV in OOV are .
That is why I think it is a good OOV to OOV to get the Member States to OOV OOV the OOV upon OOV workers OOV they change OOV and social security legislation .
In my opinion , we cannot , however , OOV OOV to OOV OOV workers OOV for OOV in legislation .
It is better to OOV OOV not only of the problems there have always been , but also of new problems that might OOV .
I should also like to support the view that we should do more to OOV OOV OOV .
This is a very OOV problem , but one of great importance to many people .
<SPEAKER OOV OOV " NAME=" OOV " > Mr President , Commissioner , I would like to make a few OOV following on from this OOV .
OOV of all , I would like to thank Mrs OOV for the work OOV has done .
OOV , my contribution should of course be OOV as an OOV to the OOV Council and the Commission , but OOV the OOV Council , to do something about this OOV at long last , particularly in the OOV that this is the start of the necessary OOV of the OOV of workers OOV Europe .
OOV work OOV under OOV OOV , and will OOV , especially once the OOV countries have OOV .
<P> OOV this , there are still major problems to OOV with .
OOV in my own country and a number of OOV countries , OOV and OOV , I OOV that different OOV wish to OOV different OOV .
OOV involved with OOV workers OOV in favour of the principle of the country of OOV , trade OOV support the principle of the country of employment , the government itself OOV in the principle of the country of OOV , and so it OOV on .
It is about time we made a decision , and in that OOV , we are OOV to support a number of amendments which Mrs OOV OOV , and which are OOV OOV to OOV a OOV approach .
We OOV OOV the principle of the country of employment as point of OOV , and to OOV this OOV European social OOV .
<SPEAKER OOV OOV NAME=" OOV " > Mr President , I should like OOV all to thank the rapporteur for this report .
It is good that we should not OOV OOV workers and their problems .
The report is further OOV that OOV OOV OOV OOV OOV and OOV , proposals for which have been before the Council for two years .
We can , therefore , once again OOV the OOV of OOV in OOV more OOV OOV at the OOV OOV in OOV .
The OOV OOV OOV OOV agree with most of what the rapporteur OOV , but I OOV and OOV OOV with OOV when OOV OOV it as a problem that OOV more OOV of national social OOV are OOV through public funds .
OOV OOV concerns the OOV , and not the OOV , of social security OOV , and it is important to make this clear .
I should like to OOV this , because it is OOV this form of OOV which has given an OOV OOV to those OOV OOV of the EU who OOV that the EU is OOV the OOV OOV system .
It is OOV those who OOV OOV to the EU who are OOV working to ensure that OOV at all OOV in this area .
They OOV to OOV that the Council ' s OOV for action does in fact have OOV - OOV for those people and their OOV who work OOV national OOV and who are OOV by OOV .
However , one further OOV of the Council ' s OOV to OOV is , in OOV fact , that it is the OOV , OOV of the OOV responsible , who take the decisions .
The OOV OOV such a OOV about democracy , but it can OOV be OOV to OOV to take the necessary decisions and , in that way , to OOV people to OOV and to give the OOV a OOV of OOV which OOV OOV to have .
<SPEAKER OOV NAME=" OOV " > Mr President , I wish to OOV by OOV Mrs OOV on OOV excellent report on the situation of OOV workers and , in particular , the social and OOV problems these workers OOV .
I should also like to thank Parliament for the support given to the Commission 's proposal to OOV the OOV of OOV OOV to OOV OOV , the proposal to OOV and OOV that OOV , and for the OOV support given to the OOV OOV .
<P> The Commission fully OOV your concerns as OOV the problems OOV by OOV workers .
I therefore welcome your proposal to forward the resolution to the Council .
<P> OOV me to now set out OOV the Commission 's approach to the points OOV in the resolution .
OOV , on social security and the OOV market , the report OOV on the Commission , before the end of this year , to OOV an international OOV for the Member States and OOV countries OOV the position of OOV workers .
This is an excellent OOV and OOV can be taken of the OOV OOV under the OOV OOV .
OOV a OOV could OOV best OOV and OOV that could be OOV both at Community and national level , and the European Parliament will be involved in its OOV .
<P> On the OOV of OOV OOV for OOV OOV , I would OOV you that the Commission has OOV itself in its social policy OOV to OOV in OOV a directive on the OOV of OOV OOV .
This initiative will OOV the already OOV directive in this field , which was adopted in OOV .
As the proposal will be OOV on OOV OOV of the OOV Treaty and OOV on the OOV OOV for its OOV , Parliament will be fully involved .
OOV I can OOV that a OOV OOV the OOV and OOV of OOV work is already OOV to be OOV out under the OOV OOV in OOV .
<P> On the OOV taken by social security OOV for OOV OOV cooperation in order to OOV OOV to OOV OOV , I am very much in favour of such OOV and can OOV that it is the OOV of the Commission to OOV such OOV and to OOV OOV of OOV and best OOV .
In fact the Commission is already OOV support to such a OOV OOV the OOV of the OOV OOV , which OOV part of OOV , OOV and the OOV .
<P> OOV regard to the OOV of the OOV and OOV OOV , there are important legal OOV OOV being OOV in new OOV before the Court .
These OOV concern OOV OOV and the OOV health system .
The Commission will OOV the OOV of these OOV before taking a position .
<P> On OOV to the OOV of OOV , OOV , OOV and OOV , the Commission has already taken the initiative and OOV a proposal for a OOV of the European Parliament and the Council on OOV within the Community for OOV , OOV OOV OOV , young OOV , OOV and OOV .
On OOV OOV 2000 the OOV Council adopted its common position on this proposal .
<P> I wish to thank Parliament for its support on this matter and I hope that the OOV OOV will OOV Parliament and the Council to OOV the OOV OOV .
<P> On the OOV of a proposal for a directive on the OOV of OOV OOV reports , OOV Member States would be OOV to OOV their legislation as to the OOV for OOV workers , I should make it clear that it is already the Commission 's OOV to ensure that all OOV of national legislation are OOV with the Treaty and the OOV legislation of Community law .
The Commission will certainly continue to use the OOV OOV down in OOV OOV of the Treaty and to OOV OOV OOV against Member States when they OOV Community law .
However , I OOV that the OOV proposal for a directive OOV to provide for a more general OOV OOV OOV of the OOV of national legislation , that is in itself OOV with Community law but might OOV further OOV to OOV workers .
<P> The Commission is not OOV that it would be appropriate to OOV such a OOV OOV .
It OOV to the Commission more appropriate to OOV OOV cooperation of the OOV involved in the different regions and at Community level in order to OOV any OOV OOV of national legislation on OOV workers .
<P> Finally , my OOV on OOV .
OOV social security , there is no Community legislation at all on OOV OOV .
OOV Member States are extremely OOV of their OOV in this area .
That is particularly OOV of their OOV to OOV into OOV OOV OOV .
OOV , there is OOV OOV of the Commission being able to OOV OOV the OOV of measures by Member States , as OOV in the report .
<P> OOV this will not change following the Treaty of OOV .
As you are aware , OOV to our common OOV , the OOV of OOV in Council was OOV for OOV OOV .
<P> OOV are , OOV , OOV to be OOV about the OOV of the OOV made in the report OOV OOV in the State of employment .
In fact , the OOV view in OOV OOV is that the State of OOV rather than the State of employment is best OOV to take account of the OOV situation of OOV .
<P> In OOV , I wish to thank Mrs OOV again for OOV OOV report and to OOV the Commission 's OOV to OOV its efforts to OOV the problems OOV by OOV workers .
<SPEAKER OOV NAME=" President " > OOV you Commissioner .
<P> The debate is OOV .
<P> The debate will take place OOV at OOV OOV .
OOV OOV OOV OOV <SPEAKER OOV NAME=" President " > The next OOV is the OOV question ( OOV ) by the Committee on the OOV , OOV OOV and OOV OOV to the Commission , on the OOV implementation of certain environmental OOV OOV , OOV , OOV ) .
<SPEAKER OOV NAME=" OOV " > Mr President , Parliament 's Committee on the OOV is OOV concerned that we are OOV European environmental legislation and then OOV to OOV it OOV .
OOV it OOV , we believe that the Council of OOV , the Commission and the European Parliament are OOV in a OOV of the public .
OOV OOV OOV that the OOV of people support the OOV that environmental issues are important and should be OOV with at European level .
<P> We are OOV legislation that OOV to OOV this need .
In fact , in all too many OOV , environmental OOV are OOV , OOV are not OOV , reports are not OOV in to the Commission on time and those countries which OOV the law go OOV .
The OOV of this debate is to OOV what is going OOV and to OOV and do something about it .
The Committee on the OOV has put together three reports , we call them OOV reports ' , OOV OOV on the OOV of the OOV OOV .
We have OOV that the OOV directive is OOV in OOV and law OOV .
The OOV directive is OOV by the OOV of Member States to OOV the OOV OOV of the OOV they OOV .
The OOV directive was OOV OOV from the OOV and all but two countries , OOV and OOV of course , are now before the European Court of OOV because of their OOV to OOV it .
<P> It is OOV OOV that these OOV are OOV OOV the OOV of EU environmental law .
What can be done about this ?
We hope OOV that in the environmental action programme , which the world is OOV OOV , the Commission will OOV in OOV resources for following up what has OOV to legislation .
It would be OOV to OOV from the Commissioner OOV how many people in OOV OOV are responsible for this as OOV to those OOV the OOV of new legislation .
<P> There needs to be a much more OOV debate OOV - OOV and at the European level - about the real OOV of OOV the environmental OOV set out in OOV legislation .
OOV often , we OOV , Member States OOV up to OOV OOV because it OOV good to do so , and OOV or OOV them is OOV as OOV OOV .
If , in fact , they cannot OOV with what they have agreed to , such countries are OOV OOV OOV OOV .
If the OOV and OOV , for example , now have OOV with the OOV directive , why did we not OOV more about it when that directive was going through this Parliament ?
OOV did the OOV Government , in fact , vote against that directive OOV ?
<P> OOV the OOV of OOV OOV must be taken into account when a law is adopted .
A good example of the OOV to do this is the OOV OOV OOV directive which the government of OOV cannot OOV to OOV with .
We OOV that the same OOV will OOV with the national OOV OOV directive .
<P> OOV , we want Member States to OOV the OOV which will OOV them , all of them , to OOV out the OOV work that must OOV the OOV implementation of many of the EU OOV we OOV here .
<P> OOV OOV and I were OOV OOV that the Council OOV it could not agree to our proposal to OOV the environmental OOV OOV into a directive .
We were not OOV an EU OOV but OOV that Member States should agree to OOV their national OOV up to a common high OOV .
We will continue to OOV this OOV in two years time when the issue should OOV to us .
<P> OOV , we want much OOV action by the Commission to take Member States to OOV when they OOV EU law .
OOV OOV the OOV Government , which can OOV OOV to do so , OOV the second OOV of a OOV , now OOV over EUR OOV million for OOV to OOV with a OOV of the Court of OOV over the OOV of OOV in OOV .
This was OOV years after the Commission OOV the first OOV about the OOV of that OOV and no less than OOV years after the directive concerned OOV into OOV .
<P> It is OOV that a OOV country should get itself into a situation of OOV back OOV to OOV , but OOV OOV that the case should have taken so long .
<P> Finally , OOV me say that we in Parliament are not OOV or OOV by the OOV that the European Parliament should only be concerned with the OOV of legislation and not with its OOV .
OOV the OOV Council was OOV OOV and even OOV that we had OOV into their OOV and that our OOV was to take the environmental OOV OOV very OOV .
OOV , as we will all know , are on the OOV end of public OOV of OOV implementation .
The public OOV to OOV to us , not to the OOV Council .
In the interests of the people of Europe and their environment , we will OOV this issue and we will not OOV go .
<SPEAKER OOV NAME=" OOV " > Mr President , first of all I thank Mrs OOV for OOV important question .
I would OOV all the Members of the European Parliament that implementation of European Community law OOV both the OOV of OOV into national law and their OOV to OOV decisions .
It also OOV OOV of other OOV such as OOV programmes , making OOV and OOV .
<P> The OOV OOV by the Committee on the OOV in these three reports are indeed not OOV to the three OOV OOV but OOV to all OOV environmental OOV .
The Commission , and not least the OOV OOV are aware of these OOV and have for some time OOV efforts to improve their OOV in this field and I can OOV you that next OOV when the Commission OOV the OOV OOV OOV OOV the whole implementation issue will be a very important point in that programme .
<P> We have a number of OOV at our OOV to improve implementation .
We can , for example , OOV information to give a more OOV OOV of the state of OOV and I know that we have also OOV some of these reports and OOV OOV to Parliament and that we can do much more to ensure some OOV attention as well .
We can OOV OOV to aid in the OOV and OOV of progress in implementation .
We can take legal measures to OOV up implementation .
OOV OOV specific OOV have been OOV on a number of OOV including environmental OOV , which of course will put OOV on the Member States to OOV the OOV rules and OOV ; OOV and OOV OOV at national level where we have been involved in OOV a OOV role ; OOV to OOV , OOV ' OOV OOV - also very important because this is also about education - and the OOV of this OOV OOV on the implementation of environmental law .
<P> We have also OOV to OOV a clear OOV between implementation of the OOV and Community OOV which has OOV to be very OOV as well as OOV a OOV OOV with the OOV financial OOV , because when they see that the OOV is OOV if they do not OOV with the OOV this will OOV put OOV on the Member States .
<P> In OOV last year we had a first OOV and OOV OOV , as we call it , on OOV OOV quality .
A second OOV will take place in OOV this year and I will continue to OOV this up so as to give us a OOV of how Member States are OOV Community legislation .
OOV last OOV the European Parliament and the Council , as Mrs OOV said , OOV an agreement on a OOV which will OOV OOV OOV for environmental OOV in the Member States .
OOV these OOV are OOV to increase the level of OOV of and OOV with European Community and environmental law .
OOV course , I OOV that there is still much to be done .
We have to look for new OOV to OOV the OOV OOV and OOV of environmental legislation .
For example , we need to work to improve the OOV of people at the local and regional level .
OOV public OOV at these OOV would OOV to OOV OOV and to public OOV for OOV implementation of environmental legislation .
We must OOV OOV and OOV to ensure that the situation OOV and I would like to OOV to the European Parliament my OOV OOV and that of my services to OOV the OOV possible level of OOV with European Community environmental law .
<P> OOV this end I will OOV all means available , including the OOV OOV OOV set out in OOV OOV and OOV of the European Community Treaty and OOV and OOV of the OOV Treaty , which may OOV to OOV economic OOV on OOV Member States .
<P> I would be more than OOV to OOV more resources and OOV from the European Parliament to work on this .
OOV we have about OOV to OOV OOV working full or OOV on implementation , and , of course , we would need more than that .
But I also think that it is for every civil OOV here to actually look at the implementation part of OOV new legislation .
I have been very clear from the OOV that I will put more OOV on implementation .
That needs the three I ' s : information , OOV and implementation , which should be the OOV for the future .
I hope that you will agree with me that we are OOV to make progress on OOV implementation and if both the Commission and the European Parliament continue their efforts to OOV the problem and OOV on it , further progress will OOV be made during this OOV OOV .
<SPEAKER OOV OOV " NAME=" OOV OOV OOV > Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , in the field of the environment and public health , the main problem with the European OOV process is not its OOV to OOV appropriate legislation .
The problem OOV , on the one hand , in the OOV with which OOV are OOV into national law and , on the other , in OOV in their implementation .
The environmental OOV that we are now OOV , on OOV , OOV and OOV , are OOV of this very problem .
There is OOV point in our having OOV the directive on OOV and the OOV of the " OOV 2000 " OOV in order to OOV OOV of Community importance , when the Commission has been OOV since OOV for all the Member States to present a OOV OOV of these OOV , as well as their OOV , rules and management OOV .
The same problem OOV to the directive on OOV .
OOV there is OOV point in our having OOV the OOV on OOV and the OOV of all OOV OOV OOV and OOV with a view to OOV public health , if OOV years on , the OOV OOV of Member States have not only OOV to OOV the directive , but have also OOV to take the most OOV action , which was to OOV OOV and to OOV OOV for OOV .
<P> We therefore have OOV OOV and for that reason , these OOV have not OOV the environmental results OOV for .
We also have a situation , however , in which a OOV of OOV OOV .
The OOV of the Community 's legal OOV and the OOV use of financial OOV against those Member States that are OOV to OOV have OOV out two OOV political OOV .
OOV States that do OOV feel that there is no OOV to continue and those that do not OOV do not feel any OOV to change their OOV .
<P> It is therefore OOV for the Commission , as OOV of the OOV , to OOV the whole process of OOV and OOV Community law , OOV the OOV of all the Member States and OOV that those States that do not OOV will be OOV as an example .
<SPEAKER OOV OOV " NAME=" OOV > Mr President , as Mrs OOV has so clearly OOV , the OOV which OOV from the OOV of the implementation of the three OOV in question OOV OOV OOV for concern .
OOV the fact that the measures OOV quite OOV , it OOV that the OOV of Member States have OOV a long way OOV OOV in OOV them OOV .
OOV , quite OOV from the OOV OOV specific to each of the three OOV , this is a serious situation which must OOV us to OOV on the OOV OOV it .
<P> I would like to OOV two OOV of the issue : on the one hand , in our countries , OOV of the environment is OOV OOV OOV at the OOV OOV of the various OOV OOV but OOV to be OOV as a OOV of OOV to be OOV out a OOV in order to OOV OOV .
On the other hand , OOV because of this OOV approach , it is often OOV that the OOV are too OOV to OOV and that it would not OOV any real OOV to do so .
<P> The OOV OOV OOV in , when all is said and done , OOV environmental OOV to be an OOV which has been OOV , an OOV OOV which OOV no OOV .
But the environment is our future and we cannot OOV OOV on OOV or OOV of a OOV from the Court of OOV to OOV it .
I , too , am of the opinion that , since the OOV OOV OOV OOV adopted a OOV OOV approach to environmental policy , it may be that , when OOV the OOV , we OOV to place greater OOV on the OOV of social and economic OOV such as local authorities in the OOV of the OOV , so that the OOV of our environment OOV OOV an OOV to be OOV into the OOV OOV OOV .
<P> In this OOV , it will be important , as we state in our OOV for a resolution , to ensure OOV OOV of the best and OOV results OOV by the Member States in the implementation of the environment OOV .
This could even take place OOV the OOV and would OOV the OOV in the OOV of each of the States in this matter and OOV their OOV to public opinion , which is OOV always more OOV than OOV of the Court of OOV .
In order to OOV the OOV OOV , but also OOV between the different OOV , I feel that it is also even more important to continue to OOV OOV on common OOV in the field of the environment .
<P> The OOV of the environment OOV national OOV and is a field of Community action OOV OOV .
It is also for this reason , and even more so in the OOV of the now OOV enlargement to countries of OOV and OOV Europe , that we must not OOV that the decisions adopted by OOV and the OOV OOV should then be OOV .
The OOV world is a common OOV , and our OOV to OOV OOV must OOV as an example to the OOV countries , who are in the OOV of OOV often extremely serious OOV of OOV .
If this situation is to improve , each of us , as a OOV of Community , national or local OOV but also OOV as a OOV , must do our part .
<SPEAKER OOV NAME=" OOV " > Mr President , my OOV , OOV OOV , has just OOV me a OOV which OOV that OOV OOV OOV OOV more than OOV in OOV out environmental OOV and making appropriate OOV .
OOV , if that is the case , then something is clearly very OOV , and I OOV it is not OOV with OOV .
I am very OOV to support most of what the OOV of the Committee on the OOV has said , although I have some OOV in OOV so being OOV that the next OOV OOV may well be against the OOV for its OOV to OOV with the OOV OOV directive , OOV the fact that a great deal of OOV has been OOV and OOV made in recent years to OOV such OOV .
<P> I want to make it clear , OOV , that I do not believe that we should be OOV the OOV of some Member States to achieve OOV with environmental legislation to OOV OOV our OOV or OOV that too much legislation is OOV .
I am all for being OOV and for making OOV that new legislation OOV OOV but the problems we OOV both OOV the European Union and OOV the world are too great for us to OOV our OOV .
OOV I think some of the progress made by the United OOV in OOV the OOV directive over the OOV year OOV very clearly that it is very often not the OOV of the legislation but the OOV of political will which is to OOV for the OOV to OOV the OOV we all wish to see .
<P> I want OOV to support the OOV of a OOV which the Commissioner mentioned and of OOV to OOV and OOV those Member States which are OOV to OOV the OOV of OOV , of the Commission and of the public .
As a OOV , the Commissioner OOV very well the importance of making OOV that that information is OOV in a way which is OOV OOV and OOV by every OOV OOV the European Union and OOV a few OOV as well .
<P> So , OOV us call it the Commission 's OOV OOV OOV , no , OOV us call it the Commission 's OOV OOV OOV , OOV one with a few OOV OOV on its OOV .
OOV us OOV and OOV at every opportunity and OOV the public OOV us in OOV that this environmental legislation is OOV and that Member States OOV their OOV .
<SPEAKER OOV LANGUAGE="ES " NAME=" OOV OOV " > Mr President , Mrs OOV well OOV the concern of the OOV of the Committee on the OOV , which in my case is OOV since I OOV to the European Parliament ' s Committee on OOV .
OOV OOV OOV of the OOV OOV to this committee come from citizens concerned for the OOV of the environment .
OOV they OOV OOV to the OOV directive , the environmental OOV directive , the OOV OOV directive and the right to information directive , which together with those OOV here today on OOV and OOV are OOV the OOV most often OOV .
Mr OOV 's report OOV that there are some Member States before the OOV , OOV with OOV against them , and only two Member States that are OOV OOV .
Mr OOV too , in his report , OOV those Member States that have OOV OOV the OOV directive .
<P> The Committee on OOV and I , OOV , know that what often OOV is that Member States OOV do not OOV in time or , as we say in OOV , and I do not know if there is a good OOV , they OOV the OOV OOV " OOV to OOV OOV .
In OOV , with the OOV human resources of the Committee OOV , who are always having to OOV the OOV not only of the OOV but also of the OOV , it is very difficult to work , Commissioner .
<P> It is OOV that we respect the legislation that we OOV OOV up , and the OOV that there is a OOV of political will is that some Member States OOV it and OOV OOV it .
This can give OOV a OOV OOV .
<P> In my opinion , there are three OOV OOV .
OOV , something that has already been mentioned here : the OOV use of European OOV ; European OOV must not be given to OOV that OOV Community law .
OOV , OOV OOV must be OOV ; it is very OOV ( I am from a region that OOV needs European OOV ) , but even if it is very OOV to OOV certain OOV , if it is not done the Member States will not OOV .
OOV , Mr President , the process must be OOV up .
But I know that this OOV in the OOV of the OOV , this OOV in the OOV of the OOV , this OOV in the OOV of us all .
<SPEAKER OOV OOV " NAME=" OOV " > Mr President , the OOV of these OOV is to OOV the environment .
This means that not only do the Member States OOV the OOV into national legislation , they are also the OOV who actually OOV this national legislation .
This also means that when OOV implementation , it should not be the means to an end , but the end itself , which should be OOV at .
<P> OOV , OOV has OOV that Member States often OOV to OOV European OOV OOV .
OOV , OOV , such as those OOV to OOV OOV OOV OOV OOV , are OOV .
As far as the environmental OOV are concerned , the European Parliament has OOV to great OOV to ensure that this is OOV OOV .
However , negotiations have not OOV to the OOV of a OOV directive , because the Council and Commission do not want that at this OOV .
OOV this OOV of the Member States , I OOV that in future , problems will OOV at the implementation OOV of other OOV too .
We need only call to OOV the many OOV OOV by the Commission to the Member States , which in some OOV have OOV to OOV OOV .
This can only get OOV after enlargement , because the current Member States are OOV the OOV example .
<P> OOV there are OOV in OOV , the Commission should put forward OOV proposals for OOV rules .
These amendments are not OOV for OOV or more OOV measures , but should help improve the OOV of the current rules .
<P> As far as the OOV OOV OOV OOV directive is concerned , we should also OOV our attention to the OOV .
If these are to be OOV for much OOV , it will be a rather long time before this directive OOV itself OOV .
<SPEAKER OOV OOV NAME=" OOV " > Mr President , OOV me to start by OOV with OOV Mrs OOV and many of my OOV Members have said and to OOV on a number of points .
As OOV has OOV out , we have the legislation .
The problem OOV in OOV and OOV this legislation .
OOV course , the political will must be there but it OOV OOV on the OOV OOV out by your OOV , Commissioner .
If , for example , you OOV OOV OOV , OOV of OOV with them through OOV OOV , you should take a OOV and OOV OOV and make OOV the legislation really is OOV .
OOV if we have OOV to go to the European Court , then OOV us do so and , if OOV need to be OOV , then we shall do that too .
<P> As Mrs OOV has said , OOV is already OOV EUR OOV OOV a OOV and I OOV that OOV will come to its OOV and OOV into OOV .
I should particularly like to OOV your attention to OOV OOV on OOV 2000 areas .
We should not OOV OOV to go OOV in these areas with a OOV OOV , because OOV OOV of the directive OOV that only in the OOV of OOV OOV should a OOV be OOV out for OOV OOV of OOV public interest in OOV 2000 areas .
OOV here again I would OOV you that in an area of OOV , in the area of OOV , where OOV is against OOV the OOV OOV which , it should be OOV the OOV of the OOV and OOV OOV itself OOV in the OOV 2000 areas , your OOV has OOV OOV about the OOV Government 's OOV to OOV this OOV , which will have a OOV environmental OOV , even OOV OOV OOV OOV .
I shall be OOV - and I welcome the OOV which you OOV in your OOV and I hope that it is a real OOV - what OOV in all the areas in Europe which are OOV 2000 areas including , of course , the OOV OOV , where there are OOV to OOV a OOV which will OOV out an important OOV .
<SPEAKER OOV NAME=" OOV " > Mr President , first of all I must thank the Commissioner and the OOV and other OOV for their words of OOV .
They are very positive and clear OOV to do something about this very serious problem .
<P> But it is not just words we need , it is OOV , it is OOV , and we cannot OOV on Member States to do this OOV .
OOV if OOV of the Council were here , which they do not OOV to be , even if they were OOV to make OOV , which they do not OOV to be , we would not be able to OOV them to do it on their own .
We need some OOV of OOV to OOV and ensure the implementation of legislation .
OOV our own OOV OOV does not OOV to be up to the OOV yet .
We can but hope .
<P> So what OOV do we have ?
What can OOV do ?
OOV , these three reports before Parliament today are a start .
They OOV and OOV .
They call for OOV .
They make proposals for further OOV .
But , they also make a point which we must take on OOV here in Parliament .
They say OOV that OOV legislation should OOV have been put on the OOV OOV .
OOV that is a OOV that we have to take to OOV .
OOV we have to start to think about OOV less but better .
We have OOV about OOV it but OOV not done so yet .
OOV we put better legislation on the OOV in future , it has to be OOV .
<P> OOV of the OOV of Member States to put into place legislation , OOV the OOV and OOV legislation , we now have the extremely serious problem of a OOV OOV of our OOV OOV by a OOV OOV OOV .
That OOV OOV is OOV but OOV OOV in the human OOV OOV , OOV OOV which are already OOV OOV OOV OOV OOV in certain OOV OOV , OOV OOV , and in some OOV OOV OOV , such as OOV .
They are now OOV up the OOV OOV to the point where our OOV are now OOV to OOV OOV of these OOV that are OOV those that are OOV by the OOV OOV OOV .
If we are not OOV to take serious action OOV in future we will see further problems of this OOV OOV future OOV .
We OOV it to those future OOV to OOV this issue .
<SPEAKER OOV OOV " NAME=" OOV " > Mr President , I OOV the opinion of Mrs OOV and many other OOV who say that once legislation has been OOV down , it should be OOV .
I also agree with Mrs OOV and OOV OOV OOV the OOV directive : " that was OOV from the OOV .
It was OOV legislation .
OOV is it possible , if you want to OOV OOV OOV of OOV in OOV , to OOV the same OOV OOV OOV OOV OOV the OOV European Union , from OOV to OOV ?
OOV to say , the OOV OOV in OOV is much OOV than in OOV , and so in OOV , as a general OOV , more OOV OOV OOV OOV can be OOV than in OOV .
As far as I am concerned , every OOV can have as many OOV as he OOV , as long as he does not OOV the OOV OOV OOV .
<P> OOV now to OOV , how it is possible that the Commission has not OOV any clear OOV on how OOV are to be taken , the OOV OOV of these OOV , the number of OOV a year they should be taken , and how OOV OOV can be taken into OOV ?
OOV these OOV are still OOV and OOV OOV from country to country and OOV to OOV .
OOV if OOV is OOV , how is it OOV that it OOV from OOV OOV OOV ?
A great number of farmers use OOV OOV ; how is that OOV ?
What is the OOV of OOV OOV , for example ?
What is the OOV of major OOV OOV into other countries ?
<P> OOV OOV cannot be the only OOV of OOV OOV , and it is OOV OOV to OOV farmers to OOV its use if we do not know the other OOV .
I OOV the view of all the OOV who say that we must OOV OOV environmental policy .
I do not OOV the OOV of OOV OOV of OOV in OOV , but I do want clear OOV on how it should be OOV and how these OOV should be OOV out .
<SPEAKER OOV LANGUAGE="SV" NAME=" OOV " > Mr President , I have OOV the report on the OOV to the OOV directive and have , in the OOV , OOV the clear OOV that many Member States really did not OOV what OOV they were taking on when they adopted the directive .
They did not OOV how OOV it really was .
This is one of the most important OOV for why progress has been so OOV .
However , the fact that progress has been OOV does not OOV that OOV is OOV .
In OOV fact , an OOV OOV is OOV in this area , OOV not as much as we should like .
OOV the directive is OOV into question , it is important to OOV that what is OOV is important , even if progress is OOV .
<P> I also believe that this is an OOV for why OOV resources have been OOV in information and in OOV with those OOV OOV by these OOV areas , something which also OOV OOV OOV OOV in many areas .
I believe there is a OOV to be OOV from this .
<P> OOV , the Member States have OOV responsibility , both OOV and OOV , but , for the OOV s part , it is important not only to OOV and to OOV funds - good OOV these OOV OOV are - but also to OOV the many good OOV there are and to use its own financial resources to OOV OOV development .
<P> The situation we have is OOV serious , OOV because of the extremely OOV OOV of OOV .
OOV can we see a OOV of this OOV .
The work must therefore continue and , in the present situation , the directive OOV not to be OOV or OOV .
<SPEAKER OOV OOV " NAME=" OOV " > Mr President , I very much welcome the fact that we as Parliament also OOV our OOV OOV and that we take a look at OOV which OOV with a great deal of OOV in the Member States .
OOV only do they OOV with a great deal of OOV in the Member States , they also OOV OOV OOV in the European Parliament .
I would like to OOV on two OOV today .
<P> These are the OOV directive and the OOV directive .
What do these two OOV have in common ?
The fact that the Member States have been OOV OOV OOV to OOV OOV OOV , OOV to be OOV , and certainly as far as the OOV directive is concerned , the OOV areas .
There are now an OOV number of OOV from OOV of the OOV OOV OOV of the States OOV who ask us what in OOV ' s OOV we have been up to .
However , it is not Europe which OOV that the whole of the OOV should be OOV a OOV area .
It is the OOV itself which OOV to do so .
It is then up to us , with the OOV help of a number of OOV , to see how , by means of OOV OOV , we can OOV the OOV legislation , for example , in order to OOV the OOV , this being a OOV in OOV OOV , in a OOV OOV .
<P> The same OOV to the OOV directive .
OOV ' s OOV , a OOV OOV OOV between OOV and OOV , has been OOV to a OOV for the OOV time because of two European OOV .
These OOV were OOV OOV by a OOV group for the OOV and OOV of this OOV who OOV that , if they OOV the OOV , they could get them to OOV .
But OOV OOV is something which does not work , even in the OOV OOV .
OOV again , for the OOV time , the Council of State in the OOV OOV a OOV OOV OOV to a OOV .
However , having OOV the OOV directive and having OOV OOV the OOV on areas where OOV is OOV , we see that this OOV was OOV .
<P> What should OOV now , and that is why I support the report on the OOV directive , and most certainly the OOV directive , is for the European Commission to make it quite clear - and OOV OOV down in OOV in clear OOV OOV - what is and is not possible .
We agree on the OOV , they are OOV , but the way in which the Member States deal with them is OOV by any OOV .
<SPEAKER OOV OOV " NAME=" OOV " > Mr President , OOV OOV with environmental legislation is a OOV problem .
As OOV , it is important for us to OOV our OOV , but we should not OOV the OOV to the Member States too OOV .
We must also consider the quality and OOV of the legislation we OOV .
The Union is OOV OOV OOV and more OOV .
We must therefore OOV down rules which can OOV in the different national OOV .
That is why I think we should OOV less OOV .
We must be very OOV in the results we want , but not in the way in which the results must be OOV .
For that reason , I believe we should OOV by the result , a OOV of OOV OOV , in the OOV directive .
We do OOV a certain OOV of OOV with regard to the OOV by which the result is OOV .
<P> OOV example of OOV legislation is the OOV directive .
The environment is a common OOV ; environmental OOV a common OOV .
It OOV no OOV to OOV OOV in one country if they are being OOV down OOV the OOV in another country .
The OOV directive OOV a clear OOV .
The way in which it is to be OOV is quite OOV .
The directive is not OOV , but OOV a framework which OOV OOV for OOV up local or regional interests , and that is OOV how we need to OOV forward .
As long as the result - OOV for the OOV OOV and their OOV - OOV OOV .
<P> OOV to say , there are many OOV in OOV and OOV with regard to the directive ' s OOV .
There are OOV of OOV OOV .
It would be OOV and necessary to provide clear information , but I am taken OOV by the OOV number of OOV who have OOV a OOV of the OOV and OOV directive in order to work out in further OOV certain OOV in the OOV directive .
The OOV OOV of this would then be OOV and major public interest .
The very OOV of the OOV directive OOV in its OOV .
The directive OOV for a OOV way of OOV the environment .
It is not about OOV up OOV OOV the environment , but about OOV with the OOV and OOV resources in a OOV OOV .
<P> OOV , I OOV that some OOV are OOV to the OOV by OOV in an OOV that the OOV infrastructure should OOV , or that major new OOV are not OOV .
<SPEAKER OOV LANGUAGE="DE " NAME=" OOV " > Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I was OOV to find this OOV on the OOV today .
I would like to thank Mrs OOV for OOV the question .
OOV you OOV to three specific EU OOV , I would point out that what we are OOV about here is a OOV problem with the OOV of EU legislation in the Member States .
If you start from the principle that OOV and OOV are adopted by the Council and Parliament in the EU , then it is quite OOV to OOV that the Council - which does , after all , use these OOV - will OOV them in the Member States OOV .
<P> But what do we see OOV ?
OOV OOV are OOV .
On one OOV there is the European Union , which OOV to OOV the Member States for OOV .
On the other OOV , there are the Member States , which are more than OOV to OOV their problems OOV the OOV Europe , OOV in the process that they are part of Europe themselves , and the Commission is OOV .
Commissioner , you have OOV to great OOV to OOV and ensure that these OOV are OOV in the European Union in a OOV OOV .
But it really is not that OOV and , of course , we have OOV your OOV OOV .
I can OOV to an OOV , why you OOV the OOV you did .
<P> There are various OOV as to why countries have OOV OOV this legislation .
In my opinion , one of the OOV in the case of the OOV directive is the OOV to OOV OOV OOV , because one OOV is for OOV , it is not possible to OOV OOV OOV as OOV as we OOV .
OOV OOV will not OOV it .
However , in the case of the OOV directive , Parliament OOV the OOV quite clearly last year , OOV that the directive was OOV and OOV in OOV and so it cannot be OOV in the Member States .
OOV we were in OOV , we OOV how local people are OOV to OOV it .
But OOV , they do not know what is going on .
They do not know where the OOV are , or how to OOV them OOV .
These are OOV that must be OOV as a matter of priority .
<P> But it is also our responsibility to ensure that the OOV are less OOV and far more OOV in OOV .
Mrs OOV 's question actually OOV all the points we need to OOV and there is OOV more to OOV to it .
OOV OOV and OOV OOV of OOV will OOV us to OOV this problem .
However , I would just like to point out that something needs to change in the Member States too , because the OOV OOV are , no OOV , OOV too OOV to OOV the OOV they OOV here , in their own countries , if this could OOV to conflict .
<SPEAKER OOV OOV NAME=" OOV " > Mr President , I should first of all like to thank Mrs OOV and the OOV for the three reports we are OOV today .
OOV implementation of the OOV s environment OOV in the Member States is OOV of great OOV in two OOV : OOV , in terms of environmental OOV - which is , of course , the whole OOV of the OOV - but also in terms of our not OOV OOV to be OOV in EU OOV work through the Member States ' being able for a long time to get OOV with not OOV the legislation which they themselves have OOV OOV about in the Council of OOV .
That is why I think that the three reports OOV the Member States ' OOV to OOV EU legislation are important .
<P> The Council has , of course , been rather OOV about the fact that Parliament is OOV over its OOV , but I think that the work on the reports has OOV how OOV the OOV of the Member States are about OOV EU legislation .
They have also OOV how OOV the Commission ' s and the Court of OOV ' s OOV are when it OOV to OOV implementation .
We often , of course , OOV OOV OOV about OOV European OOV and the Europe of the future , OOV from Members of this Parliament .
We also OOV this OOV of OOV from many OOV , but it often , of course , OOV the fact that OOV national interests are being OOV OOV of the common interests we have OOV for in the course of the OOV work .
It is also OOV to OOV that those countries which are often OOV as rather OOV and OOV in OOV to certain OOV of EU cooperation are in OOV those countries which OOV best with EU decisions .
In all OOV , I am OOV , for example , of the OOV countries .
I was OOV to OOV Mrs OOV ' s OOV on the reports .
I am OOV that Mrs OOV has the will to ensure that the legislation is of a OOV high quality to be OOV and to ensure that it is OOV OOV up .
I think , at any OOV , that Parliament OOV to provide as much support as possible for this work .
<SPEAKER OOV LANGUAGE="DE " NAME=" OOV " > Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , Mrs OOV 's question OOV the fact that the best OOV in the world are no use OOV OOV they are OOV OOV and , more OOV , OOV OOV .
For example , the Member States have not OOV the OOV directive into national legislation .
The same OOV to a great deal of other legislation .
OOV this is legislation which we need for the future .
The Commission is responsible for OOV and for OOV what OOV of OOV OOV have been OOV out .
In OOV so it , in OOV , must OOV on information OOV to it by the Member States .
I get the OOV that OOV is no OOV OOV and if the Commission is to OOV this OOV it needs information and OOV and reports to be OOV in .
<P> The OOV was often OOV in the OOV that the Commission did not have enough OOV and resources to OOV the OOV OOV in for OOV OOV .
I should therefore like to ask the Commission if it now has OOV resources .
OOV you , Parliament cannot OOV , because we are OOV OOV for reports .
I know that the Commission is very OOV OOV and OOV reports and that this OOV OOV up Commission OOV and resources OOV .
<P> In other words , we all have to think where we can make OOV .
I think the Commission should OOV more OOV , both towards the Member States and in OOV the necessary OOV before the OOV and OOV OOV .
<P> At the same time , I call on the Member States to OOV their OOV to OOV and OOV legislation and report to the Commission OOV .
<P> I am the OOV responsible in our group for the OOV framework directive and the rapporteur for the OOV action programme , which is still OOV , and the OOV directive is therefore a matter of particular concern to me .
On OOV , OOV OOV . OOV , we shall be OOV on the OOV report , to which I have OOV a number of amendments .
I should like to ask the House to OOV these OOV amendments , because what we are OOV to do here is to give the Member States more responsibility .
I should therefore be OOV for your support .
<P> Finally , I should like to OOV one more point , OOV the OOV countries .
We OOV OOV countries to OOV European legislation .
But when the Member States themselves OOV to OOV by it and the European Commission is OOV to take OOV action , then OOV OOV to go OOV .
For this reason OOV and , most OOV , in order to OOV human health and the environment , all those responsible need to OOV OOV the matter OOV and these reports make that clear .
<SPEAKER OOV LANGUAGE="DE " OOV " > Mr President , what a OOV that no OOV so far has OOV for the environmental OOV to be OOV down .
Mr OOV , it is OOV to with the OOV Member States not OOV what they were OOV themselves in for .
OOV right now they know full well that they are OOV and OOV OOV European legislation .
They are OOV for time and they know OOV well that OOV will OOV to them , because it OOV so long for the Court to do OOV .
What we have here is the OOV OOV of European legislation and OOV Parliament OOV the Council should OOV for it .
<P> OOV OOV are OOV that we should OOV and OOV .
I can OOV and OOV OOV because OOV is one of the countries which has OOV to OOV with the OOV directive , but I must also OOV , Commissioner , because OOV has not been at all OOV as far as the OOV directive is concerned .
We did OOV here which OOV to be done even before there was a European directive .
We OOV a OOV OOV back in OOV and an OOV OOV OOV OOV in OOV .
We are being OOV OOV here .
<P> As far as the OOV directive is concerned , OOV has now OOV its OOV , but we know only too well that the Member States had OOV OOV OOV the OOV directive .
The main problem here was that , because of the extremely high OOV of OOV in many OOV of the Union , OOV to within the OOV of OOV OOV of OOV OOV OOV of OOV OOV OOV OOV with the OOV of OOV OOV in OOV countries .
<P> OOV such a high OOV of OOV will be less of a problem in the future , because OOV , those OOV and OOV OOV , are OOV back .
The form of OOV which OOV OOV us may well be a OOV of OOV on the part of these OOV OOV .
<P> We should take a OOV from OOV and OOV OOV OOV and OOV with the OOV which we OOV have OOV .
<SPEAKER OOV NAME=" OOV " > Mr President , the OOV directive , OOV directive , major OOV OOV , OOV OOV , OOV , OOV OOV , OOV OOV , not to OOV the OOV directive , the OOV directive and the OOV directive .
The OOV is long , the OOV of the OOV of my own country to OOV EU environmental law .
OOV OOV OOV , OOV OOV , OOV of legal action to the European Court of OOV , so it OOV OOV .
We are second OOV in terms of OOV and OOV of OOV under the OOV directive .
<P> OOV , but OOV , there can be OOV OOV for OOV OOV of a directive and the OOV directive has come in for particular OOV in this regard here today .
<P> But to OOV to provide information OOV by the Commission under OOV OOV of the Treaty in a OOV and OOV OOV is OOV .
That is the first OOV : OOV to the OOV of the Commission .
No government should be OOV OOV OOV and OOV OOV .
That is one of OOV 's and , I OOV , many countries ' OOV OOV in OOV to the area we are OOV .
OOV OOV OOV Member States to OOV OOV with the Commission in OOV with OOV , to OOV OOV and to state OOV OOV .
<P> OOV last OOV I OOV in the OOV OOV that the OOV of the Commission 's OOV OOV , Mr OOV , OOV to OOV 's EU OOV , Mr OOV OOV , last OOV that the OOV authorities were not OOV OOV with OOV on environmental issues .
<P> Commissioner OOV OOV last OOV to the OOV OOV of the OOV , Mr OOV , OOV that the OOV number of OOV environmental OOV OOV being OOV with by the EU OOV be OOV with in his OOV or by the OOV OOV .
No OOV , no progress , OOV even no OOV - I do not know .
OOV OOV % of the Community 's OOV , to our OOV we in OOV have been OOV OOV % of the Commission 's environmental OOV .
Mr OOV had OOV words for not only our OOV of the OOV but also our OOV of OOV OOV , our OOV OOV OOV , our OOV OOV OOV and , indeed , our local authorities .
<P> OOV and OOV implementation must be OOV to ensure political and public cooperation and OOV of what we have to achieve .
I often give the example - as I did at a committee meeting this OOV - of the OOV of the only OOV OOV in OOV in the OOV OOV of OOV .
This is on a local OOV OOV .
In its OOV to OOV the OOV , the local OOV OOV to OOV the OOV from the OOV area .
It very OOV OOV OOV that the OOV of the OOV ' OOV and not OOV OOV had , in fact , been OOV to OOV that particular OOV .
OOV and more OOV OOV , better OOV OOV as OOV ' - even OOV they are all OOV OOV - OOV a OOV in the OOV and OOV to OOV OOV the OOV once human OOV was OOV .
OOV the OOV OOV between human OOV and our environment OOV to the OOV of this OOV OOV .
<P> Finally , it must not be a case of the last OOV OOV the OOV OOV the OOV OOV .
We have to OOV and OOV a OOV in these OOV .
OOV we cannot continue to OOV our OOV 's health and heritage .
<SPEAKER OOV NAME=" OOV " > Mr President , I should like again to thank all the Members of the European Parliament for their OOV .
I could not agree more with most of what you have said , OOV for any OOV of OOV .
OOV I OOV you that , as of today , OOV % of all the OOV are on environmental issues and OOV - OOV OOV , OOV % of the OOV - about OOV - are on environmental OOV .
So there is a OOV OOV on us and we are OOV to do our best but also look to the future .
That is why I am OOV that we also have to look out for new OOV and OOV to do more .
<P> Mr OOV 's point was that we need the good OOV of what economic OOV can be made from OOV with environmental legislation .
We could do more on that .
We could do more with the use of OOV because we have to OOV .
We have to be better at OOV the results of OOV with environmental legislation .
We are most OOV when we have a good and OOV OOV between the OOV , OOV not OOV the fact that Member States are responsible .
They have to give us OOV and provide us with information .
We do not have the means to OOV people to all the Member States to OOV .
We cannot do that OOV you give me another OOV people .
<P> What we have to do is OOV legislation .
It has been said that we need less but better OOV proposals .
I agree with that .
The OOV way is the OOV approach , to say OOV OOV of OOV for example in OOV OOV .
But this cannot OOV in other OOV OOV of a OOV OOV , such as the OOV directive .
It is no OOV that the OOV and OOV OOV are OOV as OOV of OOV OOV because they are very OOV .
They are OOV OOV and in some OOV it means the Member States need to OOV fully their agricultural OOV .
We know this from some of the Member States .
This should not be taken as an OOV , but an OOV of why these OOV are OOV for OOV of implementation .
<P> I OOV agree with Mr OOV that it is not because these OOV are not good or OOV enough .
They are OOV and there are OOV for the Member States which they OOV did not OOV when the decisions were taken .
We must not give in now , we have to OOV on because we will OOV start to see results .
What we have done , which is very OOV , is to OOV the OOV between European OOV and OOV with environment legislation .
We have to OOV on that .
<P> We can do more on education and information .
We have OOV OOV like this .
We use our OOV to go to Member States or to OOV out OOV to OOV the Member States how to best OOV it .
We OOV to use all these available OOV to improve implementation .
In an OOV and more OOV Union , clear and OOV OOV OOV , as well as education and OOV for OOV , OOV and OOV results , become more and more important .
I hope for the European Parliament 's support and OOV in our further OOV to improve the implementation of our European Community environmental legislation .
<SPEAKER OOV NAME=" President " > I have OOV a OOV for a resolution in OOV with OOV OOV ) of the OOV of OOV .
<P> The debate is OOV .
<P> The vote will take place OOV , OOV , at OOV OOV .
OOV OOV OOV farmers in the Union <SPEAKER OOV NAME=" President " > The next OOV is the report ( OOV ) OOV by Mr OOV , on behalf of the Committee on OOV and OOV OOV , on the situation and OOV of young farmers in the European Union OOV .
<SPEAKER OOV NAME=" OOV " > Mr President , Commissioner OOV , ladies and gentlemen , I am OOV to be able to present to you today the Committee on OOV and OOV OOV ' s OOV report on the situation and OOV of young farmers in the European Union .
<P> OOV years OOV , I , OOV , was a OOV of my local young farmers ' OOV in the OOV of OOV in OOV .
OOV in those OOV it was not OOV for young farmers to OOV on the OOV OOV or get OOV in the industry .
OOV the situation has become even more difficult , and we are OOV a OOV OOV in the number of young farmers OOV into the industry .
We have OOV a point where it has become OOV to take action in order to OOV this OOV .
OOV only for the OOV of OOV itself , but also to OOV OOV OOV in our OOV .
The last OOV that we want to see is a OOV OOV where the OOV and OOV OOV which we take for OOV will not be OOV after OOV any OOV .
<P> I would like to take this opportunity to thank the European OOV OOV for its help and cooperation in OOV me to OOV this report .
I was given the opportunity to OOV young farmers in OOV Member States which OOV me a better and OOV OOV of the OOV OOV in which young farmers could be OOV in the industry .
<P> I would further like to thank Commissioner OOV for his OOV and I would also welcome the OOV opinion on the report OOV by the Committee of the OOV because it is going to do a report on young farmers .
<P> OOV but not least , I would like to OOV my OOV to OOV OOV OOV who OOV an excellent OOV on the situation of young farmers in the European Union last year and OOV OOV has been of great help in OOV today 's report .
The report OOV forward a OOV of OOV and OOV of OOV young farmers OOV up or OOV on in their OOV .
I have , however , OOV not to OOV the OOV .
OOV I would like to see the OOV of a OOV OOV level of OOV for young farmers OOV the European Union .
<P> I am fully aware that it is not an OOV OOV to come up with one OOV OOV all the different conditions OOV young farmers in their OOV countries in a Community of OOV Member States .
OOV OOV just two OOV : OOV OOV can OOV from EUR OOV OOV OOV OOV to EUR OOV OOV OOV OOV .
OOV of OOV OOV OOV with some Member States OOV OOV OOV OOV which OOV the OOV of young farmers very difficult , especially where OOV OOV are very high .
<P> I do not have the time to go through all the OOV made in the report , but I will OOV some of the measures which should be given priority : the OOV of OOV OOV of up to EUR OOV OOV , in OOV with OOV interest OOV for OOV OOV of up to EUR OOV OOV for OOV years .
OOV of the major OOV OOV by young farmers are the OOV of OOV OOV and OOV the OOV of OOV their financial OOV by OOV OOV interest OOV .
<P> We are OOV in a OOV OOV .
OOV to education and OOV needs to be further OOV in order to OOV young farmers to take full OOV of the OOV OOV OOV by OOV OOV OOV and OOV OOV OOV .
The OOV OOV of OOV , OOV OOV by OOV OOV OOV , means that OOV will continue to change .
It is in our best interests that young farmers are well OOV to OOV and to OOV these future OOV .
<P> OOV safety measures and OOV OOV are being OOV OOV these OOV .
There is greater OOV on OOV OOV OOV Europe .
OOV again , young farmers must be OOV in a position which will OOV them to OOV a new OOV OOV and to be aware of the OOV OOV to OOV OOV OOV and support for agricultural OOV .
There is OOV OOV for OOV and OOV local OOV OOV .
<P> The European agricultural industry is going through a difficult economic OOV with a great deal of OOV going on at the same time .
There is a great need to OOV some of the OOV farmers to OOV in OOV .
In this OOV , I would very much like see a OOV OOV for OOV farmers OOV to OOV in young farmers to OOV on the industry .
I would like to ask Commissioner OOV to OOV to Member States that they OOV such a policy OOV the OOV
We are OOV the OOV OOV of the OOV Community increase with OOV OOV of young farmers .
This OOV must be OOV .
<P> OOV farmers need greater OOV to OOV rights .
It is not OOV to OOV the OOV of OOV OOV rights to young farmers if they have to be taken OOV from OOV farmers who themselves are already OOV financial OOV .
OOV , in future , OOV rights are OOV , I would like to ask the Commission to take into greater account the need to increase the OOV of OOV OOV which is given to young farmers .
<P> OOV the OOV in the OOV on OOV OOV importance to OOV development OOV , it is OOV to OOV the young farmers as the OOV OOV and main OOV responsible for the implementation of such new OOV OOV OOV .
<P> OOV the OOV enlargement of the European Union , I would OOV OOV the OOV Member States to start OOV OOV measures for their young farmers already at present , especially in view of the OOV of OOV OOV OOV by the Commission .
In many OOV of the world , OOV OOV is a common OOV .
I would like to ask the Commission to OOV the OOV for OOV OOV OOV within the common agricultural policy .
<P> As I have already mentioned , this report is an own initiative report of the Committee on OOV , and I hope all parties will be able to OOV up for this report and make OOV positive OOV help is given young farmers in the future .
I would also like to thank Commissioner OOV once more for his support and also ask OOV to OOV an OOV to be OOV out every two years on the OOV and OOV of measures put in place to support young farmers .
<P> It is very important that we do not just OOV great OOV OOV to OOV young farmers , but actually OOV OOV within the common agricultural policy that increase the number of young farmers OOV into the industry .
<P> <SPEAKER OOV OOV " NAME=" OOV " > Mr President , Commissioner OOV , I wish , first of all , to OOV the Committee on OOV and OOV OOV and , in particular its rapporteur , Mr OOV , on the OOV initiative to OOV the debate on this issue to the European OOV .
It is OOV years since OOV OOV , the Commissioner responsible for OOV from the time the Commission was OOV OOV OOV , OOV his OOV OOV of the common agricultural policy , the OOV OOV .
<P> It is my view that the European OOV have not OOV OOV OOV to this great OOV in European OOV .
I still OOV this OOV work today and I still find that it OOV many of the OOV we need to the problems OOV by young farmers , which are OOV OOV in Mr OOV ' s report .
We have OOV a major common policy OOV on support OOV OOV OOV , OOV OOV or even OOV to OOV OOV ; we have OOV OOV rights and OOV OOV ; we have OOV OOV OOV for OOV OOV and we have OOV OOV systems OOV in international OOV .
The results have been OOV , with some positive OOV but with many other OOV OOV .
OOV the OOV , I would OOV the OOV this policy has had in OOV major problems for young people OOV to OOV themselves in OOV .
The OOV OOV OOV up on this issue by Parliament OOV that OOV is still the major OOV for European farmers .
The OOV also OOV OOV of OOV to OOV to be the main problem OOV young farmers .
OOV to this OOV , for each OOV point increase in OOV for OOV OOV , the OOV of OOV OOV up by OOV % .
This OOV is OOV OOV by OOV systems and by OOV OOV .
<P> We cannot , therefore , OOV the need to OOV and support the OOV and OOV of OOV OOV we consider OOV that could be made to the current OOV
The OOV to this OOV of agricultural policy will OOV OOV a policy OOV on farmers and their OOV and not on the OOV , the OOV or the OOV by means of which the OOV is OOV .
It will OOV an agricultural policy that is OOV in regional rather than OOV terms and will OOV priority for the environment , OOV development , OOV OOV and OOV OOV .
<P> OOV OOV , I should like to OOV to Mr OOV and to the Committee on OOV and OOV OOV that this report should not be OOV as a OOV OOV but rather as a point of OOV for a OOV OOV into OOV OOV and OOV the common agricultural policy with the specific OOV of young farmers ' OOV .
OOV the OOV OOV would be a good place to start .
<SPEAKER OOV OOV NAME=" OOV " > Mr President , Commissioner , on behalf of the European OOV OOV I would like to OOV my OOV OOV to the rapporteur for his excellent work .
OOV OOV indeed go to OOV , then .
In this OOV OOV I would like to OOV attention on a OOV of points .
The report OOV excellent account of the problems of young farmers .
OOV problems are OOV with particularly well .
This is to be OOV , because it is young OOV who are OOV OOV to continue OOV than young women are .
The problem that has come about is what is OOV to as the OOV OOV OOV .
<P> In OOV we need OOV , especially with regard to OOV OOV .
The OOV OOV of European farmers is OOV high .
It must be OOV OOV to OOV the OOV system .
OOV people must be OOV to start OOV .
There are not enough young OOV , however .
It would be very important if we could get young people to continue in a OOV that is important to us all .
OOV farmers are very OOV and are not OOV about OOV OOV OOV in their work in the OOV and in OOV OOV .
OOV , they can make use of the OOV information OOV in their OOV .
We are on the OOV of great change , which the rapporteur OOV to our attention here , and it is the young , if OOV , who are best OOV to OOV us through this OOV , which we will OOV have to OOV within a few years .
<P> The OOV and measures OOV in the report are OOV OOV that have to be OOV upon OOV , and this is good for OOV .
The EU can and must OOV OOV that work as OOV for the young .
OOV must not become a OOV to OOV the position of young farmers .
<SPEAKER OOV LANGUAGE="ES " NAME=" OOV OOV " > Mr President , Commissioner , first of all I should like to give Mr OOV my OOV , OOV and support for his report .
<P> In these OOV when the OOV OOV can see that the quality of life is no OOV OOV OOV to OOV and OOV and OOV OOV OOV , we have the OOV in the Union to OOV and help the OOV OOV to take over from the OOV so that the OOV of life and people in OOV may be OOV by means of new Community OOV that have the young OOV as their priority OOV .
<P> We must put into OOV the OOV and OOV OOV in this OOV report so as to make OOV life more OOV to young people , OOV OOV OOV of the OOV .
This social group is the future basis of the OOV OOV OOV ; we have to increase OOV OOV and OOV OOV OOV for this group , particularly in those OOV OOV areas where OOV OOV and OOV OOV are common , where young people can OOV the OOV OOV .
OOV this will be OOV to the development of new OOV of regional interest , such as OOV and OOV OOV , or through OOV these OOV OOV with OOV and OOV OOV , OOV to the OOV and OOV development of the area .
<SPEAKER OOV OOV OOV " > Mr President , the first part of the OOV for a resolution in the report OOV the now OOV OOV on the OOV situation and OOV of young farmers in the European Union .
However , no OOV is made of why this should be so , given that the OOV two Community support OOV OOV two programmes for the OOV of young farmers , which the European Union OOV as a OOV which would OOV all the problems OOV by young farmers and OOV the OOV OOV .
This OOV OOV OOV OOV the resolution , which OOV to OOV three OOV OOV which , OOV they are OOV with , will OOV the third Community programme for young farmers OOV OOV .
<P> These OOV are , first , that the OOV , especially in its OOV form and following OOV 2000 , does not OOV a OOV OOV for most small or OOV OOV OOV , or a OOV OOV for the OOV of these OOV , which is why no one OOV to OOV OOV at all in the OOV sector , however many OOV there may be - not that there are that many - because not only is it OOV , it does not even OOV a OOV OOV .
<P> OOV , there is OOV OOV to OOV the OOV to ; in other words , because of the OOV , young farmers have no reason to work , given that the OOV have been used up for all the OOV and they must OOV for a national OOV to be OOV and OOV to young farmers or OOV OOV , in which case , good OOV to them .
<P> OOV , however high the OOV , the terms and conditions are such that they are more OOV to OOV farmers and OOV small and OOV farmers .
The OOV for very OOV OOV areas , even in OOV regions , is a OOV example .
This OOV OOV OOV when OOV with OOV .
In other words , the Community OOV young farmers to have a OOV OOV and OOV OOV , but OOV OOV them from OOV OOV with the OOV system .
This OOV situation is not , in my view , an OOV , OOV OOV by the European Union .
It is OOV policy , the OOV being to OOV OOV , OOV farmers and support OOV OOV or rather OOV OOV in the agricultural sector .
<P> That is why we cannot vote in favour of this report ; it is because it OOV the real OOV .
OOV these OOV , when they are given to OOV , OOV farmers , are OOV out in OOV and OOV and OOV is a OOV example here .
I do not know , for example , if Mr OOV is aware of the fact that our OOV for young farmers have still not been OOV , OOV the fact that the government used this OOV of OOV to OOV point in order to OOV OOV last OOV .
<SPEAKER OOV OOV " > Mr President , I want to OOV by OOV the rapporteur on his very OOV and OOV report which I and my group have no OOV in OOV .
<P> In the OOV of OOV 2000 , very OOV efforts were made to deal with the serious problem of OOV in European OOV .
A OOV OOV OOV OOV , OOV aid and other measures may not , however , achieve our OOV OOV and in my view the problem must be OOV as a matter of OOV , OOV the OOV of OOV OOV will be put at serious OOV .
OOV from the OOV OOV and OOV OOV of OOV , which I believe will be OOV , the real problem for young people who in OOV OOV would take up OOV as a OOV is the OOV , welcome OOV it is , of OOV and certainly more OOV OOV employment .
<P> OOV and OOV must OOV this OOV and do so before it is too OOV .
OOV as a OOV has the OOV responsibility of OOV our citizens OOV security and quality , and we must OOV to OOV the OOV OOV of European OOV by OOV that young people with the OOV of OOV in their OOV are OOV OOV and OOV .
<P> I OOV that many small OOV do not have the OOV to OOV OOV OOV for their OOV because of OOV and OOV .
I believe we must do more to OOV those OOV in a OOV programme - and the rapporteur made OOV to it in his report - through the OOV of OOV and human resources , which would OOV to greater OOV and OOV OOV .
OOV , the opportunity of OOV development and new OOV in terms of OOV OOV and OOV employment for both women and OOV must , in every case , be OOV OOV .
<SPEAKER OOV OOV " NAME=" OOV > Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , when we OOV that OOV % of European farmers are over OOV years OOV and only OOV % are less than OOV years OOV , we must OOV OOV that the future of OOV in the European Union is under OOV .
The situation is even more serious in my own country , where these OOV are OOV % and OOV % OOV .
In the OOV , the OOV OOV OOV in order to improve measures for OOV OOV of OOV with the OOV of OOV OOV and OOV the OOV of OOV and OOV .
<P> However , the other OOV of the OOV as OOV OOV for OOV in this way has been less OOV in OOV to OOV , which particularly OOV young farmers , first of all because of the OOV in OOV OOV to OOV , OOV or OOV rights .
OOV , young farmers are OOV as a result of OOV in OOV OOV OOV to the increase in OOV OOV by the OOV systems .
OOV , it is well OOV that many Member States have not OOV measures that in any way OOV the concerns of young farmers .
I shall give the example of my own country where , after an OOV OOV of OOV when we OOV the EU , in recent years we have become more OOV and the OOV of the organisations most OOV of young farmers have even been OOV .
<P> For this reason we must , as a matter of OOV , OOV certain OOV measures which are , in fact , in OOV with the rapporteur ' s proposals .
These are , OOV , to OOV OOV OOV for OOV and OOV rights OOV for young farmers , to increase support for OOV up a first OOV and OOV in OOV OOV , to OOV a OOV OOV for OOV OOV to OOV other OOV aid , to OOV conditions for the OOV OOV of an OOV OOV OOV for OOV farmers , which will OOV up the process of OOV and , of course , to OOV OOV and information measures .
<P> The Commission must now OOV OOV proposals for measures for action and the Council must OOV them .
OOV this OOV , we will be taking an OOV OOV that will put the OOV of OOV in Europe , with all that this means for our OOV , at OOV .
<P> OOV OOV , I wish to thank OOV OOV for his OOV work on this report .
<SPEAKER OOV NAME=" OOV " > Mr President , the report OOV with a most difficult subject : the OOV for young people in the OOV industry , as the rapporteur has OOV , are OOV OOV than at any time since the OOV of the OOV and their OOV cannot be OOV from those of the industry as a whole or from the OOV of the OOV OOV .
<P> OOV OOV of the OOV of the situation can be OOV in the OOV which are now OOV at agricultural OOV .
At the two OOV in my region the number of OOV OOV to OOV has now OOV to OOV % in one case , and the OOV OOV % of the OOV OOV to OOV and small OOV .
OOV , OOV % of the OOV , however , come from OOV OOV , so there is still that OOV .
The report OOV out that there is a OOV case for measures to OOV new OOV to the industry and for OOV a much greater OOV of OOV OOV the European Union , and the issue , as the rapporteur mentioned , was well OOV with in the excellent OOV report at the OOV of last year .
There are many good OOV in that OOV of the OOV OOV OOV which we were able to use during OOV in committee .
<P> OOV that the OOV development programme is in place it is important to OOV how this programme can be used to OOV OOV and OOV OOV in our agricultural OOV .
I would OOV the need for OOV in OOV OOV , including OOV OOV for OOV OOV , and OOV OOV OOV where , by OOV together , OOV OOV can OOV to OOV the OOV OOV OOV of the OOV OOV .
I would also wish to see such OOV OOV OOV attention to the needs of the OOV OOV where new OOV are most OOV to be OOV .
<P> I hope that the Commission and the national OOV will take OOV of the many excellent OOV in this report and OOV give a OOV to the future OOV of OOV in the OOV areas .
<SPEAKER OOV OOV NAME=" OOV " > Mr President , Commissioner , I should like to OOV my OOV OOV , Mr OOV , on an extremely good report .
I want to OOV upon the small number of young people going into OOV in recent years and , at the same time , the OOV OOV number of people who are also OOV it , because , if young people do not come into the industry , there will come a time when OOV no OOV OOV .
I think that the OOV of OOV - OOV to the many OOV of OOV , OOV OOV OOV - is , at the OOV , one of the really major problems .
It OOV the whole industry in a OOV OOV and OOV OOV to the many OOV OOV who would , of course , get OOV OOV for the way they look after their OOV .
It is OOV very important that there should be OOV and that people should be made more aware of OOV OOV and of the OOV OOV and OOV that now OOV , as well as being given information about the common agricultural policy and about the OOV in which OOV and OOV are OOV after .
OOV must be OOV on OOV support - OOV , OOV and financial .
No one has in recent years OOV the many OOV of OOV we OOV into OOV OOV , OOV and OOV .
There is a clear OOV with young farmers who , of course , are responsible for the OOV and the OOV we have and , especially , the OOV we OOV .
<SPEAKER OOV OOV " > Mr President , I also OOV Mr OOV for his OOV work and the excellent report .
<P> In the OOV time I have I wish to OOV that one of the OOV OOV OOV young farmers OOV the OOV today is OOV and OOV problems in the first year of OOV .
I am OOV this proposal because young people must be given the opportunity to come into the industry on a OOV financial OOV .
OOV all , young farmers OOV the OOV to the future of all our OOV OOV .
The OOV of young people OOV the agricultural industry in the OOV is a very OOV problem .
OOV OOV that in OOV OOV % of OOV OOV are under OOV , in OOV the OOV is OOV % , but in the OOV it is a OOV OOV % .
<P> I OOV that OOV are also important OOV in our OOV OOV .
OOV OOV our OOV , it OOV our OOV OOV , OOV and services open there .
OOV and the OOV of OOV is the life OOV of the future of our OOV OOV as we know them .
If all small OOV - which OOV farmers - were to OOV just one more OOV each , then the whole OOV situation OOV the European Union would be OOV OOV .
<P> OOV all the European Union countries , only the OOV and the OOV do not OOV a specific aid OOV for young farmers .
European OOV development OOV OOV a OOV of EUR OOV OOV to be made available for people under OOV years of OOV to OOV themselves in a OOV OOV OOV .
OOV the OOV government in the OOV has not taken OOV of this excellent OOV .
<P> I therefore fully support making OOV OOV OOV OOV the European Union .
The OOV industry needs young OOV in order to OOV a new OOV into an industry which at present is OOV and OOV .
OOV farmers are the future of the OOV industry and OOV OOV in OOV OOV .
<P> I thank Mr OOV for his report and wish his report all the best to ensure that we can OOV up these important decisions taken by OOV in a specific and OOV OOV .
<SPEAKER OOV OOV " NAME=" OOV > Mr President , there has been OOV OOV of the role of young people in OOV , but even today their situation OOV OOV OOV for OOV .
It is no OOV that , after the OOV of OOV 2000 , in the current OOV of OOV OOV and with the now OOV OOV of enlargement , we are still here today OOV the future of young farmers , of those young people who , in so many countries in Europe , are OOV OOV on whether they will be able to OOV within the agricultural sector for good .
<P> OOV can we help them ?
OOV of the best OOV can only be to OOV the measures OOV down by the OOV
It is time to OOV OOV how the OOV of OOV - as , by OOV , OOV support - OOV OOV able to OOV on the OOV market .
This would make it possible to OOV the OOV towards a OOV which is more OOV towards OOV general costs , OOV the OOV of OOV .
We could also work on the OOV OOV of OOV ; after all , this is the change which will OOV the OOV of OOV .
OOV this point of view , it is then OOV to OOV that OOV should be OOV in the form of OOV in the OOV interest OOV for OOV made by young farmers .
In this way , we would be OOV the OOV of OOV OOV of OOV , which OOV the OOV of OOV OOV when they are OOV at OOV about greater use of the resources OOV by development OOV for OOV areas .
<P> I feel that , if this debate were to OOV out these OOV of OOV , we would be able OOV to start OOV the framework for a new European OOV OOV OOV on young people which , most OOV , would certainly not OOV OOV and OOV those who are OOV possible OOV in the new environmental and OOV OOV .
<P> I would like to thank Mr OOV for his excellent work .
<SPEAKER OOV LANGUAGE="ES " NAME=" OOV OOV " > Mr President , the OOV report OOV a OOV OOV of an OOV issue for the European Community and for those who wish to OOV the Union .
OOV farmers do indeed need OOV attention .
OOV , because we must support our young people in all areas of OOV , and OOV because it is in our interests to OOV the OOV OOV , most of OOV are OOV with agricultural OOV , in the OOV .
In OOV this issue , we have to OOV OOV that OOV at the OOV of our social OOV , our OOV OOV , our OOV , our OOV and our OOV itself .
<P> OOV of the problems that OOV these farmers are OOV concerned with one of the OOV of the OOV economic OOV in Europe ; OOV OOV OOV and the OOV of OOV OOV .
This report OOV an OOV for OOV action OOV a specific group and also for the implementation of OOV measures to give OOV OOV OOV a OOV social OOV .
<P> In this OOV , the opinion of the Committee on OOV , OOV , OOV , the OOV and OOV OOV to me OOV appropriate when it OOV that young farmers are not a very OOV group .
A OOV must be OOV between OOV at agricultural OOV and OOV , young people who wish to set up in OOV areas as an OOV to the OOV environment , and the OOV of farmers .
OOV within this last group I would OOV between those who are the OOV of farmers who work on the OOV and those who are OOV of farmers who , from the OOV of their OOV , are really agricultural OOV .
<P> OOV OOV that measures should be taken to OOV OOV on OOV OOV , I would OOV other OOV also mentioned in the OOV report to help make OOV OOV , which are OOV on OOV OOV .
<P> I should like to OOV another OOV of the report : we must OOV to ensure that when our future OOV of the Union OOV the OOV OOV they do not OOV in OOV OOV that OOV the development of the OOV environment in their countries .
The change from OOV OOV OOV to OOV that can be OOV with the Community situation may OOV OOV OOV OOV that will OOV OOV market OOV for OOV and OOV increase young farmers ' OOV in OOV up or OOV themselves in the OOV .
This report , Mr President , will certainly be important in so far as we can also OOV it in our own countries , in the OOV countries , and in particular in the sector it OOV OOV .
<SPEAKER OOV NAME=" OOV " > Mr President , there is indeed a OOV of OOV in OOV as Mr OOV with his OOV as a OOV OOV well .
<P> If this OOV is particularly OOV in Mr OOV 's own Member State , it is the OOV result of OOV OOV by OOV OOV over the OOV OOV years , and to OOV it the United OOV must OOV the OOV of the OOV OOV for its contribution to European Union OOV .
This has been OOV for OOV .
OOV , the rapporteur , a OOV of the OOV OOV , must work within his own OOV to OOV support for his proposals in the House of OOV .
<P> In countries where less than OOV % of the OOV now OOV in OOV areas , it is too OOV for OOV to OOV the needs of these areas , and the OOV from this debate must be that they do so at the OOV of their countries .
<SPEAKER OOV OOV " NAME=" OOV " > Mr President , first of all , I should like to OOV Mr OOV OOV on the fact that he has OOV a report which is OOV on the farmers ' OOV , the OOV in OOV areas , and not on the view from OOV .
This in itself OOV a OOV contribution to agricultural policy .
<P> But if we now OOV the situation , we could ask OOV whether there are any young people OOV out there who are OOV enough to become farmers in the European Union .
What we need is people who want to take up the OOV of OOV an OOV OOV , OOV OOV as it were , but not OOV through OOV OOV .
<P> They OOV to be OOV a OOV OOV , if we consider the OOV which young farmers OOV , as well as the OOV they are OOV to OOV .
OOV OOV just one example - and I am just OOV my own country for a OOV - OOV OOV is a sector where OOV OOV is being OOV , from the OOV of OOV right up to the OOV that the OOV OOV the OOV .
I cannot help OOV a OOV with OOV farmers and OOV who have been OOV to OOV OOV on the OOV of their OOV on the environment and OOV OOV for a long time , and do so with great OOV .
At the same time , we have to say that in many European countries the OOV for OOV OOV are OOV the world ' s most OOV .
<P> So OOV OOV to become a OOV in Europe must OOV their OOV OOV in the world .
They need to give the OOV and cultural conditions OOV OOV .
They must OOV the OOV OOV conditions , OOV a OOV OOV of OOV , both OOV and in terms of quality , make OOV OOV a OOV priority and be responsible for the OOV , even once it has OOV the OOV .
This is what we call social OOV as a OOV OOV .
It OOV OOV , a OOV of OOV and the environment , social OOV and OOV .
For this reason OOV , it would be OOV if a specific policy were set up for young farmers which is OOV on the future .
OOV of the OOV points could OOV a OOV OOV OOV to quality , OOV and environmental OOV , but also the OOV of an OOV in other economic OOV , not OOV by the farmers but by the OOV , to OOV those OOV OOV which farmers need to OOV , and to OOV the market position of farmers and OOV .
<P> What OOV me in the European Union ' s OOV policy as a whole , is that although it is OOV a great deal of attention , in the OOV sector , for example , the OOV , the OOV that is , are OOV OOV a OOV position , and that at the same time OOV from OOV , the OOV OOV , are still OOV .
In that OOV , it would be OOV if both OOV OOV and OOV were more OOV in their OOV of this area in terms of OOV .
<P> Mr President , OOV can OOV for one OOV without OOV ; it is life OOV number one .
This OOV OOV OOV .
This means that OOV does not just OOV for market OOV , but also for public health , OOV and OOV .
In OOV , if we OOV this , then we will know that , in future , young farmers will need to be OOV OOV , and in that OOV , OOV more support , more political support than they are OOV at the OOV .
<SPEAKER OOV LANGUAGE="DE " NAME=" OOV " > Mr President , Commissioner , OOV Members , I should like to start by OOV Mr OOV for his serious OOV of the situation of young farmers in Europe .
I ask you , what shall we do when there is no one to take over our OOV ?
OOV change is important and it is right , but that should not result in a OOV OOV from the OOV OOV .
<P> If we want OOV to have a future in Europe , then we must OOV its OOV .
We are in favour of a OOV OOV OOV , OOV OOV . a OOV OOV farmers are not just responsible for OOV OOV and a OOV part of their work OOV society as a whole , a society which can take OOV in OOV OOV OOV and OOV OOV areas which are OOV OOV in .
The agricultural policy and the policy for the OOV as a whole OOV for and from its OOV .
<P> We therefore need to OOV framework conditions which ensure that young people look on the OOV as OOV OOV OOV in and are OOV to continue the OOV OOV .
OOV aid and OOV OOV are OOV for young farmers , but OOV OOV has an OOV important part to OOV .
OOV farmers need to be as OOV with OOV and the OOV as they are with OOV and the OOV in their OOV .
This means that OOV and further OOV for young farmers are OOV more and more important and I , for one , support OOV OOV in OOV and OOV farmers .
<P> OOV me to say a few OOV words on the social OOV .
OOV and again I OOV farmers OOV various OOV to put OOV OOV their OOV to their OOV or OOV .
OOV go is difficult , as I know from OOV OOV , but it is the only way of OOV OOV .
So I call on the OOV OOV to help the young and to give them and , OOV , the whole OOV industry the same OOV which they had .
OOV course , and I say this quite OOV as a OOV OOV , it is no help when all we OOV about is the down OOV of the OOV .
OOV us be quite clear about one OOV : there is not a OOV OOV which is OOV all good or all OOV .
<P> Finally , I should like to say that it OOV my OOV when I see OOV and young farmers working together to OOV the OOV , OOV OOV and OOV and OOV OOV OOV into OOV .
OOV OOV and OOV will be OOV in the future even more than OOV and we must OOV OOV OOV to be OOV and take their future into their own OOV .
<SPEAKER OOV LANGUAGE="DE " NAME=" OOV " > Mr President , Commissioner , I should like to start by OOV in the OOV OOV to Mr OOV .
I think this is a very OOV OOV report .
There is a rather OOV OOV that the future OOV to the young , but we can OOV this OOV when we OOV of European OOV and say that , without young farmers , there is no future .
The future of the OOV , and especially the future of young farmers in Europe , does not look good .
The OOV OOV should set our OOV OOV OOV .
The number of OOV in the EU has OOV OOV over recent years .
OOV course , we welcome the OOV change but , at the same time , the OOV of the change does give us OOV for concern .
The OOV OOV has been in the number of farmers under the OOV of OOV .
OOV OOV that young people from OOV have the same OOV OOV as their OOV OOV and OOV .
<P> The OOV of OOV OOV down from one OOV to the next is OOV .
The question of what OOV of the OOV OOV OOV on the OOV is often still OOV .
OOV , OOV OOV OOV have become a OOV OOV - even in my country , which I would OOV have OOV possible .
OOV many young people want to have to OOV making OOV because they are farmers ?
OOV farmers want OOV OOV for their OOV .
It is not because of the OOV that they OOV to be farmers .
<P> The OOV report may help to improve the OOV OOV of young farmers .
The public OOV OOV attention to the services of OOV .
I should like to take this opportunity to thank you , Commissioner OOV , for OOV OOV the OOV OOV which OOV OOV .
But OOV OOV OOV OOV better OOV .
<P> At the OOV , you can OOV about the current OOV OOV OOV by OOV .
But no one OOV to OOV , for example , that OOV OOV in my country have been OOV OOV for OOV at OOV OOV OOV for years now .
OOV course I OOV of the OOV OOV of the OOV industry , the OOV of OOV by the authorities and so OOV , but it is all this together which has OOV in the OOV in which more and more OOV of the OOV find themselves .
<P> If you OOV to this OOV , if you are a OOV , then you will OOV OOV why young people ask , do I really need this ?
OOV the current OOV situation , it is quite out of order to OOV our farmers and young farmers .
We have set OOV .
OOV OOV OOV OOV ' has been OOV OOV by our OOV OOV young farmers .
OOV services in the OOV of OOV and OOV OOV , the development , further development and OOV of the OOV and the OOV of the OOV OOV for life are all areas in which Europe will need farmers and young farmers in the future .
<P> I should like to OOV by OOV that these young farmers do not just need OOV OOV ; they also need good OOV and OOV OOV .
OOV this OOV of environment can give them the OOV they need to OOV their important OOV in society .
<SPEAKER OOV OOV " > Mr President , I OOV that the last OOV OOV in this debate come from the Group of the European OOV ' s OOV , so we have OOV people OOV to OOV OOV OOV OOV has OOV up .
It is an OOV of the concern of this particular group for the problem we are OOV .
<P> I want to thank Mr OOV for his contribution , the OOV OOV and the very OOV report he has OOV .
I was just OOV of my OOV when I was a OOV of the OOV OOV of OOV ; I OOV my political OOV in that OOV .
I OOV a plan was OOV which was OOV on two OOV things : OOV OOV and a OOV OOV of financial OOV .
It was OOV on the OOV OOV of OOV , which was most OOV in OOV , it was a OOV OOV OOV the OOV .
It was the OOV plan .
So I OOV OOV my political life with the OOV plan in my hand and today I have another OOV plan .
It is much more OOV and , indeed , I have to OOV that I do not see as many OOV OOV to the OOV OOV in this one as in my OOV OOV ' OOV in OOV OOV years OOV .
<P> OOV that OOV to OOV is that we OOV not to get OOV OOV with OOV or OOV people down the OOV OOV on this whole subject .
The OOV OOV in OOV OOV that more than OOV of the OOV OOV of the country was OOV in OOV and yet the country did not OOV OOV and there were people OOV of OOV .
There are still people OOV back to the OOV when , as an OOV OOV said : OOV OOV of OOV OOV its OOV " .
However , we should not OOV that this was an OOV world in which to OOV .
OOV the years , as the number of OOV was OOV and farmers OOV more OOV , OOV OOV OOV more available to the OOV who could OOV it at a OOV OOV .
The OOV OOV OOV have OOV a OOV of OOV in Europe .
We should not OOV that .
<P> OOV OOV OOV the European Union - I only OOV OOV because I am very OOV with what OOV OOV , but you can OOV OOV for other areas - our many small OOV were OOV OOV in number .
If it were not for the common agricultural policy , that would have been very OOV .
<P> It was a good OOV that the number of OOV was OOV and that we had the common agricultural policy to OOV that .
We must be concerned about the human problems that OOV out of the OOV of OOV OOV , but at the same time , we should OOV that the OOV of OOV has been OOV .
OOV , in the future , must be put on quality , OOV in my time OOV OOV were OOV .
OOV we need more quality and we need to consider the environment .
OOV these are things Mr OOV has OOV .
But we should not OOV the OOV of young , OOV people in greater OOV OOV the OOV of OOV that Europe needs today because they will not OOV it .
<SPEAKER OOV NAME=" OOV " > Mr President , could I OOV by OOV Mr OOV on OOV forward a very excellent report .
I know very well that he put a OOV of time and OOV into it and I am OOV it can be OOV by Parliament today .
<P> It is a very difficult subject to OOV and there is no OOV OOV to the problem of young farmers , as any of us who have any OOV of the problem and the OOV would OOV .
<P> OOV course , OOV OOV to say we must help the young farmers .
The problem is when you ask them how to make the help really OOV , they are very OOV to come forward with OOV .
OOV can you OOV young people OOV the OOV ?
You have to OOV the problem within the situation in which young people find themselves today .
OOV young people from OOV areas some OOV , OOV or OOV years OOV , at the time Mr OOV was OOV about , would OOV have OOV on to become young farmers .
<P> OOV those young people have many other OOV open to them .
They look OOV and they see their OOV going into OOV where they may OOV working at OOV on OOV and not start work again OOV the OOV OOV .
But the young OOV will work OOV OOV a OOV for very OOV OOV .
You only have to look at the financial situation right OOV the European Union at the OOV to see that we have a OOV problem here and one that is not going to be OOV to OOV .
The OOV is that if you do not get young people into the industry , you will not OOV the new OOV in and you will not OOV the industry to OOV and take on the OOV that it OOV in the future , OOV not just to the OOV of OOV , but to how that OOV is OOV and to OOV that it is OOV in a way the OOV OOV OOV .
<P> It is not enough just to give financial OOV to young farmers because then all you do is put the OOV of OOV up out of OOV .
We in the European Union have OOV in OOV OOV , we have OOV in OOV OOV OOV , we have OOV in OOV OOV , all now with a financial OOV that the young OOV could not even OOV to OOV .
So I believe the best way is to make it OOV for young farmers to OOV the OOV OOV at an OOV OOV , be it through an OOV OOV OOV or through a OOV OOV .
I certainly feel that the European OOV OOV should be OOV to help young farmers into the industry through the OOV OOV .
<P> But , if you are going to OOV this OOV in it has to be OOV and it has to be OOV in every Member State .
It is not enough to OOV it in one Member State OOV .
<P> Finally , we are OOV a OOV of OOV on OOV development and the Commission would do well to look at other OOV of OOV that OOV , because , as I see it , we could make better use of it .
We could OOV young farmers , who OOV so much OOV OOV and OOV now .
OOV farmers have OOV .
OOV ' OOV know how to use OOV and could use them on the OOV .
That is the way forward for the future .
<SPEAKER OOV NAME=" OOV " > Mr President , I welcome this report .
It certainly OOV the OOV future OOV young farmers within the European Union , OOV the support OOV by the Union and Member States .
<P> The current OOV economic OOV for OOV in general and young farmers in particular , the OOV OOV of OOV for young farmers , the OOV in the number of OOV farmers and the OOV OOV of those who OOV - these are all general OOV which OOV the problem .
It is clear that we will OOV a OOV OOV in the number of young farmers over the next OOV of OOV , OOV appropriate and OOV measures are put in place now .
<P> OOV farmers OOV OOV problems such as the OOV financial OOV when they start up and often this can be OOV by OOV OOV with OOV .
OOV is often OOV , and for young people it can be an OOV life in OOV areas , with OOV social OOV in OOV with those of a OOV OOV who work in more OOV OOV .
<P> OOV of this OOV the question : what can the European Union do ?
A European policy OOV at OOV young farmers and OOV to the OOV is OOV .
OOV OOV now there has been OOV OOV of EU OOV measures OOV by the Member States or the EU Commission .
OOV attention must be given to interest OOV OOV and OOV , OOV OOV and OOV OOV must be OOV more OOV and the OOV of enlargement on young farmers need to be OOV and OOV into any future policy approach .
<P> OOV measures that could be OOV are OOV OOV aid for farmers under OOV , OOV rights , OOV with OOV terms , better education , OOV and OOV OOV - one could go on .
But the point I want to make is that we need to do something now .
OOV take up the point made by Mr OOV : why should young people in the OOV OOV OOV in OOV OOV on the OOV ?
OOV should they OOV an OOV life ?
OOV should they be in a OOV which has economic OOV when other OOV OOV a much more OOV life , much more security , work from OOV OOV to OOV OOV , with OOV OOV and with long OOV ?
That is the problem we have to OOV and we must OOV it now .
<SPEAKER OOV LANGUAGE="DE " NAME=" OOV " > Mr President , OOV Members , I should like to start by OOV you , Mr OOV , for your OOV report on the situation and OOV of young farmers in the European Union .
I should also like to thank the Committee on OOV and OOV OOV for its work .
<P> We have OOV in OOV 2000 , especially by OOV the second OOV , to take account of the concerns of young farmers .
In some organisations of the market , we have at least OOV to OOV OOV terms to OOV OOV farmers or young farmers .
I need only OOV the OOV OOV or the OOV of national OOV OOV OOV or OOV rights under the programme to OOV and OOV OOV .
But , without OOV , the real issue here is the future of OOV OOV OOV , because if young people are no OOV OOV to take up OOV , then any further debate on OOV is OOV .
<P> OOV , without OOV , the OOV of OOV also OOV a great deal on the political framework conditions which OOV to OOV , not just agricultural policy as a whole , but also the specific terms on which a young OOV can OOV this OOV .
OOV to OOV OOV development are particularly important here .
<P> OOV 2000 OOV the OOV OOV OOV by OOV % , OOV that up to EUR OOV OOV can now be OOV in aid , and OOV to OOV OOV costs OOV for interest OOV OOV .
At the same time , the terms OOV OOV in OOV OOV OOV the OOV of OOV the OOV OOV of aid for OOV by young farmers within the first OOV years of OOV up .
These aid OOV may be as high as OOV % and , in OOV areas , as much as OOV % .
<P> OOV from this specific aid for young farmers , there are , of course , all the other OOV of aid which young farmers can OOV just as any other OOV can .
On OOV , the rules for OOV the development of the OOV are extremely OOV but , OOV to the principle of OOV , it is up to the Member States to OOV them .
The Member States are responsible for OOV what priority should be given to OOV young farmers .
<P> Finally , I should also like to point out - and OOV Member States have already OOV for this OOV - that the OOV OOV OOV , the OOV OOV for which have again been OOV under OOV 2000 , can be OOV to OOV aid for young farmers .
<P> The Commission , like Parliament , OOV that we need OOV OOV if we are to make better policy OOV .
The information which the Commission OOV OOV the information OOV of agricultural OOV and OOV OOV should , in fact , OOV in order to OOV the situation of young farmers and I do not think that we need , OOV does it make OOV to set up a new OOV especially for young farmers .
What we do need is for the OOV in question to be made available .
The Commission services are OOV working with the Member States OOV the OOV for which OOV is made in the OOV OOV OOV , especially with OOV to young farmers .
I am OOV that we shall OOV some OOV OOV from this OOV , but I must point out that we shall be OOV to OOV an OOV OOV of the programmes still being OOV by next year because we quite OOV do not have the necessary OOV .
<P> The Member States are able to OOV OOV to OOV the OOV , especially in order to take account of the results of OOV OOV .
The Commission does not OOV to OOV any new Community OOV now ; it OOV to OOV to the OOV OOV OOV in the OOV and the OOV legislation .
But we must not OOV that the young and women are priority OOV OOV under the OOV OOV Community initiative and that the OOV system which the Member States need to work out in order to OOV OOV OOV needs to take account of this OOV in Community policy .
<P> OOV of the OOV OOV in the report and the OOV for a resolution , such as OOV OOV or the OOV of OOV or OOV OOV or the OOV OOV of OOV , are OOV for which the Member States OOV are responsible .
However , OOV a great deal of OOV , the Commission will OOV the OOV of the OOV report within the OOV of its OOV and right of initiative in a OOV to help improve the conditions of OOV for young farmers and OOV the OOV .
<SPEAKER OOV NAME=" President " > OOV you very much , Commissioner OOV .
<P> The debate is OOV .
<P> The vote will take place OOV at OOV OOV .
<P> ( The OOV was OOV OOV OOV OOV at OOV OOV and OOV at OOV OOV ) OOV OOV OOV OOV ( Commission ) <SPEAKER OOV NAME=" President " > The next OOV is OOV to the Commission ( OOV ) .

<P> OOV , the European Parliament OOV agreed that EU OOV should be able to OOV OOV measures to OOV OOV , particularly as OOV OOV and OOV OOV within Europe .
<P> OOV the Commission OOV to OOV forward with measures to give OOV to what Parliament has agreed with respect to OOV OOV and the OOV of OOV and OOV OOV in particular ?
<SPEAKER OOV OOV " NAME=" OOV > Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , the Commission OOV a OOV to OOV to the OOV made at the OOV European Council to OOV up OOV proposals to OOV the OOV OOV process with a OOV OOV for OOV OOV who have been OOV and who OOV to OOV OOV .
<P> At the last OOV and OOV OOV Council , OOV on OOV OOV 2000 , I OOV the Commission ' s OOV with Member States who OOV the problem of OOV and , in particular , with OOV , and I was OOV to welcome the OOV agreement OOV between OOV and OOV .
On that OOV , I OOV that in the course of OOV , the Commission would OOV proposals on three OOV points for the Council ' s OOV .
OOV , there will be a proposal on common OOV , OOV and OOV for OOV OOV OOV .
OOV OOV OOV OOV between Member States will be OOV .
OOV , we will OOV a proposal on the OOV of an OOV OOV as the European OOV and OOV order .
The Commission has already OOV a meeting of national OOV in these OOV , which will be OOV in the next few OOV , on the basis of a working OOV that is being OOV up to present the proposals that I have just mentioned .
<P> I wish to OOV the Commission ' s OOV , OOV all its OOV under the OOV , to OOV OOV European action against OOV , an issue that will be given great OOV in the Commission ' s work programme for OOV , which will OOV be OOV in this House .
<SPEAKER OOV LANGUAGE="ES " NAME=" OOV OOV " > I must say that I am OOV with the Commission ' s OOV and positive OOV to OOV OOV and OOV measures that can OOV OOV the OOV OOV of OOV and democracy : OOV .
<P> But what is the problem , Commissioner ?
The problem is the OOV need to OOV down some OOV OOV for these measures to be OOV as OOV as possible .
<P> As you know , Commissioner , the European Parliament has OOV that the European OOV and OOV order should be OOV OOV as an OOV OOV the necessary OOV and OOV to OOV the OOV , OOV and OOV of those who in European OOV are OOV the most OOV right of all ; the right to life .
It would be a real OOV if in the new European Union area of OOV , security and OOV the law OOV OOV to support those who OOV such a OOV OOV .
<SPEAKER OOV LANGUAGE="ES " NAME=" OOV > I wish to OOV by OOV that I OOV Mr OOV ' s OOV of OOV .
OOV is indeed OOV in this matter .
I would say that the most OOV need is for all Member States to OOV and OOV the OOV and OOV OOV on OOV .
That is OOV is most OOV .
OOV , on the European OOV and OOV order , as you will see in the OOV work programme , we shall have very OOV OOV and OOV for the Commission to present its proposals .
I can OOV that OOV will be a OOV point in the OOV against OOV , which is a OOV OOV by all European countries , not as a problem for a OOV State but as a OOV to OOV , security and OOV OOV the European Union .

In many OOV , this is a OOV of the OOV of OOV OOV or the OOV of OOV OOV and OOV .
The European Union OOV that it OOV to OOV women from such OOV OOV and OOV , but it has not yet OOV a way of OOV its OOV into political OOV and decisions OOV OOV for hope .
<P> OOV the Commission be in favour of OOV forward proposals OOV such OOV OOV women might be OOV OOV for OOV OOV and OOV , in political terms , in the European Union ?
<SPEAKER OOV OOV " NAME=" OOV > I wish to say in OOV to Mrs OOV OOV ' s question that OOV OOV is OOV OOV the world by the OOV OOV OOV and the OOV OOV OOV to the OOV of OOV .
At European level , a OOV common position of OOV OOV OOV adopted under the OOV Treaty OOV ; this OOV to OOV OOV of the OOV OOV " under the terms of OOV OOV of the OOV OOV OOV .
However , there is no OOV OOV of the OOV of the OOV OOV " OOV Member States .
<P> OOV the OOV OOV OOV the European Union OOV make specific OOV to issues OOV OOV made by women , OOV women OOV human rights have been OOV , with particular OOV to OOV OOV , such as OOV OOV , OOV OOV or OOV legal OOV on the OOV of their OOV .

The Commission OOV to OOV specific proposals in OOV to some of these in the course of OOV .
These proposals will take account of the specific OOV of women who have been OOV of OOV and OOV .
OOV , the Commission has already OOV to OOV OOV OOV to OOV the specific OOV of these women .
OOV example of this is the proposal for a directive on OOV OOV OOV in the OOV of a OOV OOV of OOV OOV , which we OOV on OOV OOV last year .
<P> In this proposal , under the terms of OOV OOV OOV ) , Member States are OOV to provide appropriate OOV OOV or other OOV of OOV to women who have been OOV of OOV , OOV or other serious OOV of OOV , OOV or OOV OOV .
<P> OOV the same OOV , the Commission ' s proposal on OOV OOV to OOV to the process of OOV and OOV OOV OOV , which the Commission adopted on OOV OOV 2000 , OOV various OOV OOV the specific needs of women , such as OOV OOV OOV ) , which OOV down that women have the right to present a OOV for OOV OOV from their OOV , or OOV OOV ) , which OOV the principle of an OOV and OOV OOV for women when OOV a OOV for OOV .
There is also OOV OOV ) , which OOV women the right to have a different OOV or OOV if they feel OOV about OOV the OOV for their OOV for OOV OOV to the fact that the OOV or OOV is OOV , particularly in OOV of OOV OOV and , OOV , OOV OOV OOV OOV OOV ) , which OOV down the OOV on Member States to OOV that OOV OOV OOV in a OOV situation are given the necessary OOV OOV to deal with the specific problems of these women .
<P> The Commission also OOV to OOV measures OOV OOV with OOV needs in its proposal for a directive on OOV conditions for OOV OOV , which will be OOV in the first OOV of this year .
OOV regard to the specific issue of OOV OOV OOV the basis of the OOV OOV , the Commission has already OOV on OOV OOV on this matter and we hope that in the course of this year we will be able to OOV the necessary OOV to present to Parliament and the Council a proposal for OOV OOV that would also OOV this OOV of situation .
<SPEAKER OOV LANGUAGE="ES " NAME=" OOV OOV OOV OOV > OOV you , Mr OOV , because I OOV that the Commission OOV to OOV proposals .
I should like to say that , in the last OOV of the OOV that has just OOV , both the OOV OOV and OOV the OOV OOV OOV up new OOV so that we can OOV in OOV the very real situation in which women OOV in OOV countries , but I believe the Commissioner OOV the question Mrs OOV has OOV and I am OOV that he is to make this OOV of proposal .
<SPEAKER OOV NAME=" President " > As they deal with the same subject , OOV OOV OOV and OOV will be taken together .
<SPEAKER OOV NAME=" OOV OOV " > OOV No OOV by OOV ) : <P> OOV : European OOV industry The OOV industry OOV some OOV OOV people .
However , even with the OOV OOV OOV in OOV years , the OOV OOV to the European OOV industry is OOV by the fact that OOV European OOV OOV have already been OOV down and OOV new OOV OOV have been set up by European OOV in third countries , with the OOV OOV of OOV of OOV and OOV employment ( farmers ) and a OOV of OOV for European agricultural OOV .
What will the Commission do to OOV this OOV ?
<SPEAKER OOV NAME=" OOV OOV " > OOV No OOV by OOV ) <P> OOV : OOV OOV in the OOV industry The OOV industry OOV OOV million OOV of OOV OOV from OOV million OOV of OOV OOV on an OOV of OOV OOV OOV .
OOV the Commission OOV that , by OOV the OOV OOV OOV for OOV OOV OOV from agricultural OOV OOV , it has further OOV OOV the OOV of the European OOV industry which is already OOV of the OOV of OOV OOV by the OOV OOV of its OOV OOV as a result of the EU OOV system for OOV and the OOV of an OOV programme in the EU ? <SPEAKER OOV LANGUAGE="DE " NAME=" OOV " > Mr President , OOV Members , the Community OOV industry did indeed OOV OOV OOV OOV at the end of OOV last year for agricultural OOV OOV such as OOV , OOV and OOV , which are OOV for OOV .
This OOV is part of a OOV of OOV for OOV OOV I OOV which was OOV by the Council of agricultural OOV in OOV last year , since when OOV of these OOV have been subject to OOV OOV in OOV with the agreement OOV within the OOV .
<P> However , these OOV still OOV enough OOV to be able to OOV with OOV OOV on the world market .
It is therefore OOV OOV that OOV will OOV , because the OOV of agricultural OOV OOV used by the OOV industry will , OOV OOV , be OOV to world market OOV , that is , OOV OOV in the Union .
<P> As OOV OOV when these measures were OOV , the Commission is OOV OOV the market , including the OOV market , and the OOV situation in this sector .
<SPEAKER OOV NAME=" OOV " > I thank the Commissioner for his OOV but would ask the Commission to OOV the OOV OOV of OOV between its and the Council 's OOV OOV will to OOV the OOV industry and the measures taken , which OOV the very OOV of this industry .
<SPEAKER OOV LANGUAGE="DE " NAME=" OOV " > OOV I point out to the OOV Member that the question at issue here is the terms on which European industry OOV the OOV OOV which it OOV to OOV specific OOV OOV .
In OOV , our OOV point is the OOV of European industry , and it is OOV if it can OOV the OOV OOV which it OOV on the same terms as the OOV of the world .
I OOV to see why any OOV aid should be OOV .
In any OOV , we can only support the agricultural OOV of this whole question with our organisations of the agricultural OOV .
We are not here to use funds OOV for OOV to support the OOV industry .
It is our OOV , in OOV with the OOV of the Treaty , to support the agricultural OOV , OOV OOV . to give European farmers the OOV to get the OOV which they OOV on to the market .
<SPEAKER OOV OOV " NAME=" OOV " > I do not think that there is a OOV of opinion on the question whether we would like to see a OOV industry OOV on the basis of the agricultural policy .
What is important , however - as OOV last year - is that on the basis of the OOV OOV OOV , and other OOV , this OOV was not available for a OOV .
That is point one .
<P> OOV two is that industry has been making OOV OOV to the OOV that the OOV OOV are OOV an OOV , and so are costs OOV in OOV .
These OOV very much form part of the European agricultural policy .
OOV this , it cannot be OOV that OOV of OOV OOV in the European Union are going through a OOV time at the OOV .
In that OOV , every OOV of OOV OOV to the OOV industry is a welcome OOV , especially when OOV can OOV that they are having to OOV against a OOV OOV OOV after all .
<P> I would still like to ask the Commissioner , OOV on a real OOV OOV for OOV in Europe and OOV , also taking into OOV the OOV OOV OOV , to again OOV a OOV OOV over whether these OOV OOV the OOV of OOV OOV could not , in fact , be OOV more OOV .
<SPEAKER OOV LANGUAGE="DE " NAME=" OOV " > OOV , of course we can OOV if there is any other OOV OOV , but I must OOV that certain OOV must be OOV to , even in the area of agricultural aid because , in the OOV OOV , all the OOV being OOV here , OOV and OOV OOV , are subject to OOV and aid is OOV within the framework of those OOV .
We cannot OOV more OOV OOV now because we do not have the funds .
OOV to OOV must be OOV within the framework of the OOV OOV agreed in the organisations of the market .
We cannot OOV OOV the OOV .
<SPEAKER OOV NAME=" President " > <SPEAKER OOV NAME=" OOV OOV " > OOV No OOV by OOV ) <P> OOV : OOV approach to the financial OOV of the OOV OOV OOV to Commissioner OOV OOV , the European OOV on OOV OOV will OOV OOV EUR OOV OOV .
There is still great OOV OOV OOV for the OOV OOV .
This means that the financial measures OOV to OOV may OOV OOV of OOV between the OOV EU Member States .
<P> OOV the Commission support a OOV European approach to the financial OOV of the OOV OOV , given that the financial measures taken by the national and regional authorities that are now OOV to OOV are OOV to the OOV of OOV between the OOV EU Member States ?
If not , why is the Commission against a OOV approach ?
<P> OOV OOV <SPEAKER OOV LANGUAGE="DE " NAME=" OOV " > Mr President , OOV Members , we need to OOV in our OOV of the financial OOV of the OOV OOV between OOV measures , Community measures taken within the OOV of the common OOV of the market in OOV and national measures .
As far as Community action in this area is concerned , may I OOV the OOV Member 's attention to the OOV of measures OOV OOV to support the OOV market .
<P> OOV aid for OOV OOV and public OOV have been OOV and are being OOV OOV % by the Community .
A OOV OOV OOV for OOV over OOV OOV OOV has also been OOV .
OOV OOV OOV of the OOV of the OOV is OOV for by the Community , OOV Member States are OOV to OOV the other OOV % , together with the OOV costs .
OOV Member State which OOV to take national measures must , of course , report them to the Commission and the Commission OOV OOV what is going on in order to OOV OOV of OOV .
<P> OOV Member State OOV to OOV aid in order to OOV the OOV of the OOV OOV must OOV the Commission of the aid OOV in OOV with OOV OOV , OOV OOV , of the Treaty - as I have already mentioned - so that they can be OOV to ensure that they OOV with Community framework OOV .
<SPEAKER OOV OOV " NAME=" OOV " > Commissioner , all of this is , of course , OOV to my OOV .
OOV , I would like to thank you for your OOV and the OOV as well as the OOV you have OOV between national measures on the one hand and Community measures on the other .
In OOV , however , I have OOV that all OOV has OOV OOV , not just in my own country but - I OOV - in other countries too .
OOV own regional OOV for OOV in the OOV OOV , Mrs OOV , has mentioned OOV on OOV .
OOV have OOV the OOV of an increase in OOV , OOV still would like to OOV the OOV to Europe .
<P> OOV I can see is a great deal of OOV and OOV in my country .
OOV the fact that , OOV , the Commission will have to be OOV of such measures , there is a great deal of concern OOV farmers , and also OOV those in the OOV industry , and certainly OOV our local OOV OOV , who , at the end of the OOV , will have to take the first OOV .
OOV it indeed not be OOV to OOV the OOV or the way in which the costs will be OOV , at the time that all OOV need to be OOV out , in OOV rather than OOV , OOV OOV out any OOV of OOV ?
OOV OOV in this matter is OOV OOV , in my opinion .
<SPEAKER OOV LANGUAGE="DE " NAME=" OOV " > Mr President , the OOV Member may well be OOV with my OOV but if what he OOV is OOV , OOV OOV . that OOV by local OOV have OOV OOV in his region , in OOV , then it is up to the same local OOV to OOV the matter .
They cannot OOV the European Commission to do it for them .
<P> I have one more OOV to make on a point that was OOV .
OOV , as the OOV Member mentioned , a Member State OOV OOV or OOV measures , such as OOV OOV OOV OOV , then any such measures must , of course , be taken within the framework of OOV legislation , OOV OOV . they must be OOV with European OOV OOV , and any measures taken must be OOV by the Commission OOV .
<P> But it is also the OOV and the responsibility of the OOV Member States to OOV regional measures .
In other words , Member States must not only OOV measures taken at national level ; they must make OOV and report all measures taken .
<P> OOV to Mrs OOV <SPEAKER OOV NAME=" President " > <SPEAKER OOV NAME=" OOV OOV " > OOV No OOV by OOV ) : <P> OOV : OOV of OOV OOV OOV the OOV , the Swedish OOV OOV OOV OOV a OOV OOV of OOV OOV to OOV in OOV for OOV and OOV .
The OOV was OOV OOV in an open OOV OOV with the result that OOV OOV OOV into the OOV environment , OOV the local OOV serious health problems .
In OOV , OOV have been made for the OOV to be OOV back to OOV .
<P> OOV the Commission consider that this particular OOV OOV with the OOV rules in this area ?
OOV the Commission consider that OOV now OOV any responsibility for OOV the situation ?
<SPEAKER OOV LANGUAGE="SV" NAME=" OOV " > OOV of OOV , including OOV to and from the Community , are OOV by OOV OOV .
This OOV OOV OOV OOV on the OOV OOV of OOV OOV .
<P> This OOV OOV the OOV of the OOV OOV OOV on OOV of OOV OOV into Community legislation .
As from OOV OOV OOV , the Community has therefore OOV all OOV of OOV OOV to be used for OOV OOV or to be OOV in countries OOV the OOV
The Community therefore OOV with the OOV OOV to the OOV OOV which has not yet come into OOV OOV .
<P> This legislation is not , however , OOV to OOV of OOV from the Swedish OOV OOV , OOV to OOV during the OOV because OOV was not an EU Member at that time .
OOV , the OOV of the OOV OOV did not OOV in the OOV .
In this specific case , the Commission OOV that there is no Community legislation which can now make the OOV OOV for possible environmental OOV OOV to these OOV OOV .
The issue of OOV s OOV in this case therefore OOV a national issue which must be OOV through national environmental legislation .
<SPEAKER OOV LANGUAGE="SV" NAME=" OOV " > OOV you for your OOV .
I OOV OOV that this is how OOV OOV , that is to say that there is not at present any legislation which may be used in this OOV .
OOV , what we have here is an example of an OOV OOV trade in which OOV OOV that OOV serious OOV , especially OOV OOV in the area , is OOV to a country which is OOV to deal with it .
<P> OOV question is : if something OOV were to OOV today , that is to say if an OOV were made to OOV OOV in this way , would the rules OOV that OOV of this OOV were OOV OOV ?
<SPEAKER OOV LANGUAGE="SV" NAME=" OOV " > The OOV to that question is OOV .
There is OOV a OOV on OOV OOV OOV , including to third countries , that is to say OOV countries .
<SPEAKER OOV NAME=" President " > <SPEAKER OOV NAME=" OOV OOV OOV " > OOV No OOV by OOV ) : <P> OOV : OOV national OOV plan : citizens call for the Commission to OOV OOV than OOV OOV OOV to the OOV national OOV plan have already been OOV during the OOV OOV for those OOV .
OOV have been OOV by OOV organisations , who OOV that many of the OOV OOV under the OOV will OOV areas OOV as OOV of Community interest by the OOV Government , OOV OOV OOV OOV , by trade OOV and farmers ' OOV , who OOV the OOV OOV of the plan and OOV a OOV OOV , and by many local authorities , who have OOV attention to the OOV OOV of some of the OOV and their social and economic OOV for people OOV in the areas concerned .
OOV these social OOV have OOV the wish that the Commission should take up a position on the plan and should OOV the OOV Government OOV it to OOV its OOV OOV .
OOV the Commission OOV its position on the matter and say what OOV it OOV from any OOV it has had with the OOV Government to OOV in OOV to the plan ?
<SPEAKER OOV NAME=" OOV " > Mr President , at the initiative of the OOV OOV , Mr OOV , we OOV a meeting where he OOV the main OOV of the OOV OOV plan OOV OOV .
The plan is , at this OOV , a OOV which is OOV to be subject to OOV following the OOV OOV under way OOV a OOV OOV of OOV .
The OOV OOV for the OOV has OOV his OOV to this OOV .
At the meeting , I OOV to the attention of the OOV authorities the need to ensure full respect for all OOV OOV environmental legislation and policy including the OOV framework directive .
This OOV both to the OOV OOV OOV of the OOV plan as well as the implementation OOV .
<P> The plan OOV a OOV OOV and at the OOV of the OOV OOV OOV my services are OOV OOV the OOV plan .
<SPEAKER OOV LANGUAGE="ES " NAME=" OOV OOV " > OOV , Commissioner , it is a OOV OOV , and you know that it will OOV be going through the OOV Parliament .
OOV that this OOV , as OOV , OOV specific European OOV , both the OOV directive and the OOV OOV directive , and also the OOV of the OOV framework directive , my question is this : if the OOV law still OOV these OOV , if it is OOV to the environment , will it OOV the OOV EUR OOV OOV OOV in resources from Community funds ?
<SPEAKER OOV NAME=" OOV " > OOV course the whole process that we have now OOV of OOV and OOV with the OOV Government on this particular case means that we OOV to get all the information necessary for us to be well OOV about this process and to make OOV that the OOV Government OOV with the legislation .
You have already OOV some of the OOV OOV by this .
<P> If there were a OOV of the environmental legislation , we could actually OOV OOV OOV .
It is very important that today we have this OOV and , of course , we should not hand out OOV for a Member State to OOV environmental legislation .
We plan to OOV in OOV with the OOV Government to make OOV that their OOV are in OOV with the OOV OOV .
<SPEAKER OOV LANGUAGE="ES " NAME=" OOV OOV > I believe that the OOV OOV plan - at this OOV there cannot be the OOV OOV of this - is an OOV OOV for our country .
This has , OOV now , been the opinion OOV by OOV all OOV political OOV over the years .
In fact , in OOV , the OOV government was already aware of this need and OOV up a proposal which at the time it OOV could not or did not know how to OOV forward .
OOV , that proposal OOV an OOV OOV number of OOV than the current OOV .
OOV course , the years have OOV and the current OOV has to be OOV , OOV much more social OOV than those that have OOV before , being much more OOV OOV , and OOV OOV more OOV .
<P> So , as it is such an important OOV for the OOV development of the OOV regions , I am OOV that the OOV , OOV or OOV that the OOV for the OOV has made on OOV OOV that this is an open OOV , that this is a OOV , a proposal , and that the need for a OOV on it OOV all the regions OOV is OOV OOV OOV , my question , Commissioner , is as OOV : in the framework of the OOV cooperation between the Commission and the OOV Government , and within the OOV OOV down in the framework directive , OOV what support can the Commission provide so that this OOV can progress as it should ?
<SPEAKER OOV NAME=" OOV " > Mr President , at this OOV , of course , what we are OOV is having an OOV of information .
We make OOV that we are well OOV about what is OOV in OOV .
I can only OOV that the OOV OOV of OOV has OOV his OOV to this OOV process and I know that this is what is going on at the OOV and that there is a debate - as I OOV , a OOV debate - on this issue .
So far , since the plan is not OOV we have been OOV for some OOV and OOV , and this is what we can OOV at the OOV : to OOV in a OOV OOV with the OOV Government and to make OOV that the OOV process is OOV out as it should be .
<SPEAKER OOV NAME=" President " > <SPEAKER OOV NAME=" OOV OOV " > OOV No OOV by OOV ) : <P> OOV : OOV being taken by the Commission to increase OOV of OOV OOV in EU Member States The EU 's OOV for OOV safety are OOV .
In particular , recent OOV such as the OOV OOV in OOV as well as OOV OOV in OOV , OOV and OOV , OOV . OOV the importance of better OOV of OOV safety policy in the OOV
OOV OOV between the Member States means that common OOV need to be OOV in these areas of OOV safety as well .
<P> At the Commission , there is to my OOV no OOV between OOV and no Commissioner OOV to have OOV responsibility for these issues .
OOV safety OOV on many policy areas such as OOV , environmental and OOV issues , transport OOV , OOV .
OOV must be able to feel OOV OOV they are in the OOV
<P> What action is the Commission taking to increase the OOV of OOV OOV OOV in EU Member States ?
<SPEAKER OOV LANGUAGE="SV" NAME=" OOV " > Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , the Commission is well aware that people have OOV and been OOV as a OOV of OOV - a fact it OOV OOV - and we OOV our OOV to the OOV of the OOV .
The Commission also OOV the environmental and economic OOV OOV by OOV .
This issue is particularly important in the present situation in view of the OOV which OOV at OOV in the OOV and in OOV and in which many young people OOV .
<P> The Commission OOV that it is very important to OOV OOV safety issues .
OOV OOV safety within the Community , especially OOV OOV , is a OOV issue in the programme of Community measures in favour of civil OOV .
I can also OOV you that the OOV OOV of the OOV for OOV has OOV OOV an OOV into OOV safety in the European Union in OOV to OOV under OOV .
This OOV is OOV at OOV the OOV of OOV OOV so that OOV OOV the Union might OOV the same safety OOV .
The OOV OOV directive OOV down OOV OOV for all OOV of OOV , including OOV .
<P> In OOV cooperation with the Member States , the Commission is also OOV the OOV of the Council ' s OOV on OOV safety in OOV OOV .
In this area , the Commission OOV to OOV a report to the European Parliament and the Council during the first OOV of this year .
<P> It should also be OOV in OOV that the Member States can OOV their own safety OOV and that OOV OOV measures OOV come within the Member States ' area of OOV .
OOV , this is an OOV problem of which Community policy OOV account in a OOV of areas with a view to OOV measures adopted in the Member States .
There may still be certain OOV when it OOV to OOV OOV safety issues .
In order to get to OOV with this problem and improve OOV , my own OOV ' s civil OOV OOV , together with the OOV OOV in the areas of industry , health and OOV OOV , set up a working OOV last OOV including OOV of different OOV of the OOV services .
<SPEAKER OOV LANGUAGE="SV" NAME=" OOV " > I really must thank you for your OOV .
OOV , a good deal of progress has OOV been made in this area .
I have no OOV OOV of OOV responsibility for these OOV safety issues from national or local authorities .
The principle of OOV must , of course , OOV in this area , just as in other areas .
<P> I ask this question OOV against the OOV of the OOV OOV I have had with OOV and their trade OOV , who are quite OOV .
OOV like the public , they are , in fact , OOV more and more by OOV OOV .
OOV have to work with OOV more OOV , OOV and OOV from countries with which they are OOV and OOV OOV of OOV OOV they are not used to .
OOV OOV more and more and OOV want to be able to feel OOV OOV of what country they are in when they take a OOV , OOV through a OOV or go to a OOV .
<P> OOV this OOV , I believe it is especially important not only for each OOV to deal with these OOV safety issues but also for there to be real OOV where this OOV common responsibility is concerned .
I OOV the Commissioner ' s OOV here to the OOV that there is now just such a OOV working OOV as a OOV in that OOV and , that being the case , I should just like to thank OOV for OOV OOV .
<SPEAKER OOV LANGUAGE="SV" NAME=" OOV " > It is , of course , OOV for me to agree with Mr OOV about these OOV .
There OOV to be a way in to these issues in the Commission too .
However , it is not OOV OOV because we are also OOV with OOV of OOV which OOV OOV from one country to another and in which systems are often OOV to the OOV possible OOV to local level .
OOV , it can be difficult to issue OOV and still more difficult to issue a directive which would , as it were , be OOV OOV and OOV all these various OOV .
As I said in my first OOV , we are OOV OOV to OOV OOV as far as we can .
We are also OOV to see if we can OOV OOV OOV in all Member States and ensure that we OOV our own efforts .
<P> A OOV can be OOV now that we have a civil OOV OOV , OOV with OOV responsibility of this OOV .
We must continue with the OOV OOV process of OOV OOV OOV OOV to OOV under OOV , OOV , OOV and what have you , with a view to OOV that we become better and more OOV at OOV our OOV OOV efforts .
<SPEAKER OOV OOV NAME=" OOV " > OOV I OOV the Commissioner 's attention , as on other OOV I have OOV Parliament 's attention to the fact that , in OOV of OOV such as OOV , OOV or OOV , what is OOV is OOV State OOV to OOV the problem and , more OOV , OOV OOV .
OOV authorities can OOV OOV on their own .
What we need is a OOV plan between all the local OOV OOV so that , if one country OOV an OOV , OOV or OOV , the OOV from all the countries which are not OOV can OOV to the OOV and at least OOV OOV .
OOV you OOV this as an OOV which could be OOV with good results ?
<SPEAKER OOV LANGUAGE="SV" NAME=" OOV " > As the OOV Member points out , these issues of civil OOV and civil OOV are very important .
We therefore have a plan OOV OOV OOV for the Commission to , for example , OOV OOV OOV for OOV services and OOV to civil OOV from different Member States .
We also have better OOV within the Commission in order to be able to come up OOV with the information OOV and , OOV too , with the OOV OOV and OOV OOV OOV in order to help , OOV upon what OOV of OOV , OOV or OOV OOV may be involved .
<P> OOV I OOV OOV , I OOV for OOV that there was a need for a OOV , or OOV , with responsibility for OOV and OOV OOV OOV by OOV OOV .
It is OOV that OOV of OOV which OOV to be OOV into .
OOV is it to be OOV ?
OOV shall we be able to OOV it OOV when it is OOV ?
OOV how can we OOV OOV to be able to OOV still more OOV ?
<P> The plan and the proposal already OOV .
We also have to OOV our OOV OOV .
I believe we have made some good progress .
It is now also a question of OOV enough resources to make the plan really work in OOV .
<SPEAKER OOV NAME=" President " > <SPEAKER OOV NAME=" OOV OOV " > OOV No OOV by OOV ) : <P> OOV : OOV of the OOV OOV The OOV OOV , a OOV OOV to OOV OOV , is OOV OOV in all OOV of OOV .
<P> OOV OOV place is OOV , including , as far as OOV is concerned , the OOV , OOV , OOV , and OOV OOV , the OOV OOV OOV , the OOV OOV , and so OOV .
<P> The OOV OOV is now OOV extremely OOV and , OOV the efforts of OOV OOV , can no OOV be OOV by OOV .
<P> The OOV situation is OOV a serious OOV problem and OOV OOV those OOV to use the OOV .
<P> What OOV and financial measures will the Commission take to OOV this OOV ?
<SPEAKER OOV NAME=" OOV " > Mr President , this question concerns the OOV OOV .
This particular OOV , as the OOV Member has mentioned , is a particular problem in OOV and the management of OOV , is of course the responsibility of the Member States .
However the Commission can help in two OOV .
OOV , within the OOV of its OOV , it can OOV an OOV of information between local OOV who have the same problem .
You may for example be aware of the OOV taken by the Mediterranean OOV OOV or by the OOV general OOV , OOV region , which OOV OOV a meeting on how to OOV the OOV OOV .
<P> OOV , Community funds , in particular the OOV OOV , and the OOV OOV could be used to aid the management of the OOV OOV in respect of OOV 2000 OOV .
It would , of course , be up to OOV to OOV OOV in OOV with the OOV rules of OOV .
<SPEAKER OOV LANGUAGE="FR" NAME=" OOV " > I OOV OOV and I would like to thank you for your OOV .
I would also have OOV to know if it would be possible to OOV this OOV OOV ' or OOV no market OOV ' OOV because the problem with the OOV OOV is that it is OOV OOV for use in OOV and when people get OOV of their OOV it OOV into the environment , OOV these problems .
If we could , therefore , OOV it from OOV , I believe that this would help to OOV it OOV .
<SPEAKER OOV NAME=" OOV " > It is still within the OOV of the Member States and , of course , they have to OOV what to do or what OOV of action to take .
It would be very OOV to OOV to OOV a certain OOV .
That cannot be done .
OOV action and any OOV have to start at local level .
What we can do is to provide some OOV and OOV to OOV who have the same problem .
<SPEAKER OOV LANGUAGE="DE " NAME=" OOV > Mr President , we are always so OOV when the OOV of OOV is OOV .
What I should like to ask is whether we could OOV why the OOV has been OOV under European OOV programmes ?
<SPEAKER OOV NAME=" OOV " > I wish I could OOV that question .
I can say that the right way to deal with this problem of the OOV OOV , which is its OOV OOV , is to OOV this during the OOV OOV which are being OOV on OOV and OOV OOV .
It is a OOV for those who are concerned about these things .
OOV you will be able to get some more information about this OOV OOV and the way it has OOV in an OOV way .
That is the only OOV I can give today .
We will continue to OOV information and OOV be able to OOV all those concerned with this issue .
<P> OOV to Mrs OOV OOV <SPEAKER OOV NAME=" President " > <SPEAKER OOV NAME=" OOV OOV " > OOV No OOV by OOV ) : <P> OOV : OOV of the OOV report by the OOV OOV OOV OOV on OOV OOV the Commission OOV the OOV report OOV by the OOV OOV OOV OOV on progress made by OOV in OOV the OOV OOV OOV in safety and management OOV at OOV , in so far as the OOV at OOV OOV OOV other Member States ?
<SPEAKER OOV LANGUAGE="ES " OOV OOV > In OOV 2000 the OOV OOV OOV , the OOV OOV OOV , OOV a report on OOV OOV to the OOV of OOV OOV OOV OOV at the OOV OOV .
<P> This OOV OOV OOV OOV OOV a OOV OOV report on the progress made by OOV .
OOV the OOV OOV , the Commission ' s services are also OOV this second OOV report .
<P> In OOV , the Commission OOV that , since the OOV report was OOV in OOV the OOV OOV OOV has been OOV with the way in which OOV has OOV , for example , with the OOV OOV in the report specific to the OOV OOV , and that these OOV have been OOV , as they say in the OOV industry , which means they are OOV to have been OOV with .
<P> The Commission OOV that the OOV OOV OOV OOV the OOV and OOV OOV by OOV with respect to its concerns and also that OOV progress has been made ( I am OOV OOV ) OOV its other OOV in the OOV report .
OOV still OOV to be done , however , since in OOV 2000 only OOV of the OOV OOV ' s OOV OOV had been OOV OOV .
<P> OOV , the OOV OOV OOV has OOV that many of the measures already OOV by the OOV will still need time to take OOV fully .
In the words of the OOV OOV OOV , OOV OOV OOV OOV has made a good start , but it must OOV up the OOV of change OOV it OOV to OOV its OOV OOV .
<P> Mrs OOV , ladies and gentlemen , the Commission OOV the progress made and OOV the OOV ' OOV to see a OOV OOV towards an OOV safety OOV at all OOV of management , and , of course , within my OOV , or rather in this field , my OOV , I shall OOV a OOV OOV on what is OOV at OOV .
<SPEAKER OOV NAME=" OOV " > I wish to thank Mrs OOV OOV for OOV the situation and for OOV that OOV was OOV a OOV OOV .
<P> However , I cannot agree that OOV with OOV out of OOV OOV is progress .
It certainly is not .
In the Committee on OOV , OOV OOV , OOV and OOV , the OOV OOV of the OOV OOV OOV OOV said quite clearly that he would OOV the OOV OOV if the OOV were not OOV with in full .
OOV they have not been OOV with in full .
We can OOV about progress being OOV or OOV , but we have to see OOV in full .
<P> I hope Mrs OOV OOV that you will state here today that you wish to see OOV in full with the OOV and OOV , because that is what I want to OOV .
<P> I also OOV to the OOV OOV on other Member States , OOV the OOV of OOV , and would like to OOV the Commissioner 's attention to a report OOV by the OOV OOV OOV of OOV in OOV 2000 , which is OOV of OOV from OOV and their OOV OOV on the OOV of OOV .
I would ask you to OOV that in full also , Mrs OOV OOV .
<SPEAKER OOV LANGUAGE="ES " OOV OOV > OOV course I shall ask OOV OOV for this OOV that you have mentioned to be OOV too , if it is not being OOV already , and if we do not have it , which would be OOV , may I ask you to provide us with a OOV .
<P> In any case , we would , of course , like to see OOV as OOV as possible with all the OOV - not just OOV , but all OOV - on the part of OOV OOV OOV in its OOV and OOV at OOV , and it is OOV that if it does not OOV out all these OOV , as the OOV Government has already said , they will have to take decisions in that respect .
I must OOV you that what I can OOV to do , as I have already said , is to OOV a very OOV OOV , but OOV in this field are still national , and I know that the OOV authorities are taking a very OOV OOV on this whole question .
<SPEAKER OOV NAME=" OOV " > I OOV a question to the Commission in OOV on the environmental OOV OOV by OOV depleted uranium OOV , OOV in the OOV and OOV that some of the OOV aid OOV to OOV should be OOV to OOV and , if OOV , making good the OOV and OOV OOV OOV OOV to the people of OOV .
<P> Commissioner OOV rather OOV OOV that this was not a priority .
In view of the recent OOV OOV and concerns OOV about OOV OOV and the OOV OOV by the OOV in particular if OOV by OOV and OOV , particularly OOV OOV in the OOV of where there has been OOV OOV , have the Commissioner 's OOV OOV since then ?
<SPEAKER OOV NAME=" President " > The question on OOV OOV OOV OOV is not OOV and not OOV and therefore OOV .
<SPEAKER OOV NAME=" OOV OOV " > OOV No OOV by OOV ) : <P> OOV : OOV OOV from road transport to rail transport and OOV change OOV is of OOV OOV to the debate on OOV change , as it is the OOV of OOV % of the current OOV OOV where road transport OOV for OOV % of all transport .
OOV OOV OOV that transport is OOV to OOV the OOV with the OOV increase OOV in OOV OOV in the next few years .
OOV of rail OOV transport and OOV OOV of the rail system are important but OOV OOV towards the OOV of rail transport , the most important OOV transport OOV to road .
<P> OOV is the Commission OOV to support OOV in rail transport , OOV within the framework of the OOV OOV OOV on OOV OOV , OOV for the OOV , and the OOV OOV on OOV OOV ?
<P> OOV the Commission OOV to OOV current priority or OOV road OOV within the OOV framework so as to give OOV to more OOV transport OOV ?
<P> OOV the Commission OOV the OOV of OOV OOV OOV of transport in the framework of the OOV OOV ' OOV OOV OOV ?
<SPEAKER OOV LANGUAGE="ES " OOV OOV > At the OOV of next OOV the Commission OOV to OOV a OOV OOV on the common transport policy , which will be OOV by a OOV of OOV on the OOV transport OOV and OOV other OOV to OOV less OOV and more OOV transport systems .
These OOV are OOV to OOV OOV OOV , OOV environmental OOV , our OOV on OOV and the high number of road OOV .
The Commission is OOV up a set of economic measures OOV OOV to favour greater use of those transport OOV that still have available OOV and are less OOV to the environment .
The OOV OOV is to give a OOV to new OOV and to OOV greater cooperation between transport OOV .
<P> OOV this end , the OOV of OOV OOV will be OOV out in two OOV .
The first OOV will OOV on a few priority OOV , OOV the OOV of rail OOV transport .
In the second OOV , which is OOV to OOV before OOV , a more OOV OOV of the OOV will be OOV , OOV especially at the enlargement of the Union and the environment , and the OOV OOV transport OOV will be OOV .
<P> The Commission ' s OOV OOV the OOV OOV programmes for OOV OOV that priority should be given to OOV transport .
The Commission will present a OOV to OOV how these OOV have been taken into account .
<SPEAKER OOV OOV " > I OOV to ask a OOV question but I am OOV that I am going to have to OOV to the two OOV of my question which have not been OOV .
I OOV if the Commission was OOV to OOV current priority or OOV road OOV within the OOV OOV framework so as to give OOV to more OOV transport OOV .
That part of my question has not been OOV .
<P> OOV , I OOV the Commission to OOV the OOV of OOV OOV OOV of transport in the framework of the OOV OOV programme OOV 2000 to OOV .
You may say that it is not possible , but I think you could at least give a OOV OOV .
<SPEAKER OOV LANGUAGE="ES " OOV OOV > Mrs OOV , I must OOV you that with regard to OOV OOV right now priority is being given OOV OOV to rail OOV , if that is what you are concerned about .
The major part - the OOV - OOV to OOV rail OOV .
<P> OOV , what is OOV in this OOV OOV - in which we shall have the opportunity to OOV all these issues in great OOV , and in which problems of OOV and the OOV of the various OOV of transport , OOV , will also OOV - is OOV to make progress in OOV out OOV , which does not OOV that in some OOV we shall not have to think about OOV certain road OOV .
<P> What is also OOV is a greater use of transport OOV such as OOV or OOV transport , and what is OOV , OOV all , is to OOV the OOV of the transport system , because in the end , OOV or OOV , OOV always OOV to come into it to OOV the OOV to OOV ' OOV , which is a OOV OOV .
This means OOV , OOV OOV , and also OOV in OOV systems too .
<P> As for the OOV for the OOV OOV , I OOV cannot give you the OOV OOV .
What I can OOV you is that at the OOV more than OOV % is already being OOV for OOV that have to do with the rail sector .
<SPEAKER OOV NAME=" President " > <SPEAKER OOV NAME=" OOV OOV OOV OOV " > OOV No OOV by OOV ) : <P> OOV : OOV of energy and OOV energy The Commission has just adopted a OOV OOV on the security of energy OOV .
This OOV OOV OOV OOV to the OOV industry , OOV at the same time the Commission ' s OOV OOV a OOV OOV of the OOV of energy OOV OOV by OOV OOV , down from the current OOV % to OOV % by OOV .
OOV society is OOV the OOV of OOV OOV as an OOV to OOV OOV .
<P> OOV the Commission OOV OOV the OOV of energy OOV OOV by OOV OOV ?
If so , up to what level ?
OOV does it think it will be able to OOV the development of OOV energy ?
OOV does it plan to use OOV industry OOV as an OOV OOV of OOV for OOV energy ?
<P> OOV it not consider it OOV , and indeed necessary , to OOV the financial resources now OOV to the OOV of OOV OOV , including OOV into OOV OOV , into the OOV of OOV energy ?
<P> OOV to Mr OOV <SPEAKER OOV LANGUAGE="ES " OOV OOV > OOV Mrs OOV OOV s question on OOV and OOV OOV , I should like to OOV first of all that , at the OOV , the priority is to OOV an increase in the use of OOV OOV .
OOV this be quite clear .
<P> In no OOV , or OOV OOV , have I OOV that I favour the use of OOV energy .
In the OOV OOV - which you can get OOV of - what OOV quite clearly is the increase in support , OOV and all OOV of OOV for the use of OOV OOV .
A result of this is the OOV on the directive on the use of OOV OOV - OOV from OOV OOV - or our OOV with the OOV for OOV on the question of the OOV of aid to these OOV of OOV .
<P> OOV , the OOV OOV also OOV forward the OOV of OOV some OOV of OOV or OOV OOV from the OOV or OOV energy OOV - OOV , OOV , OOV , OOV energy , or all of them together - to provide support for OOV OOV .
<P> OOV , in any case , in OOV to this aid for OOV OOV , which I believe is OOV and is put forward not just as a OOV but as an OOV - and OOV that for the first time OOV OOV OOV to each OOV Member State are being OOV , and this is being done in the OOV OOV directive - I consider it OOV to OOV support for OOV in the OOV sector , especially into OOV of safety , OOV and OOV OOV ( because OOV it is not a OOV ) , or into OOV issues such as the OOV system .
<SPEAKER OOV LANGUAGE="FR" NAME=" OOV OOV " > Commissioner , the reason I ask this question is OOV because my OOV Members in the European Parliament have been working for OOV years for OOV energy to be taken into account .
The Commission is OOV to OOV it , but OOV energy is OOV OOV to be OOV as a OOV OOV rather than as the energy of the future .
The OOV are clear , and the view is OOV that OOV is not OOV , especially OOV with OOV of OOV made in the OOV for other OOV of energy .
<P> On the other hand , OOV energy and OOV OOV , which does not OOV any OOV OOV , were OOV OOV as part of the OOV against the OOV OOV , and it was OOV OOV that OOV energy could be OOV as an OOV to OOV the OOV OOV .
OOV , this is why we OOV the question , to see if the Commission is still on the same OOV , in OOV to continue to OOV OOV energy in both the European Union , and OOV in the world , and not just as a OOV energy OOV .
<SPEAKER OOV LANGUAGE="ES " OOV OOV > Mrs OOV OOV , I should OOV to be able to say that we could OOV all our energy OOV from OOV OOV , but , OOV , at the current OOV of OOV development this is not OOV .
OOV OOV for OOV OOV in the European Union is OOV , both for OOV OOV - because , OOV from OOV OOV , where we could have a greater OOV , the OOV have clear OOV - and for economic OOV , because it is OOV that we have to OOV aid to the OOV OOV - and I have already said that I have taken OOV , positive OOV in this respect - but even so , we have to OOV some level of OOV and OOV .
<P> OOV OOV % of our OOV energy from OOV OOV OOV to me to be a very OOV OOV , and I am OOV to make every OOV to OOV this OOV by OOV .
OOV said that , I cannot OOV the OOV , and the OOV is that , OOV from other very serious problems such as OOV , OOV energy does not OOV OOV from any OOV .
<P> Finally , I must say that the OOV problem is a very serious problem , but it is under OOV .
At the OOV , OOV , the problem of OOV change is OOV out of OOV .
It is a problem that is out of OOV now , and what is more , I am OOV it will not be OOV OOV we take major OOV .
<P> I OOV your concern .
OOV only the OOV OOV on energy but also the OOV OOV on transport - because transport has a OOV to do with this subject - take a clear OOV of OOV to OOV the OOV from a OOV change point of view and from an environmental point of view , OOV OOV development , OOV and the quality of life .
<SPEAKER OOV NAME=" OOV " > OOV you , Commissioner .
In your OOV you OOV OOV on the economic OOV , but we have to say that both OOV energy and OOV are , in fact , OOV OOV .
As Mrs OOV OOV said , can we see the same level of OOV - look at the OOV OOV on OOV in OOV - in OOV OOV ?
OOV OOV we do not have level of OOV OOV from the EU or from the Member States .
<P> I have two other points .
OOV , do you consider OOV OOV a OOV energy , because we need OOV on that ?
OOV , where we get OOV OOV as an OOV OOV of OOV for OOV energy , will we see a level OOV field OOV the OOV ?
<P> I would OOV you also to the fact - I have said this in other OOV - that OOV OOV has made OOV on OOV energy which OOV OOV the OOV of the Commission .
It is for the Member States to OOV whether they will OOV or not OOV OOV OOV OOV .
OOV the Commissioner OOV OOV from those OOV ?
<SPEAKER OOV LANGUAGE="ES " OOV OOV > The OOV OOV clearly OOV that OOV OOV need aid and support at the OOV , as was the case some time OOV with OOV or OOV OOV , for OOV .
At the OOV , OOV OOV need OOV and to be given a OOV level of support , at least - and I think they need even more .
In other words , I fully agree with you , and I say so OOV in the OOV OOV .
<P> OOV , OOV as such is not OOV energy .
OOV OOV by itself cannot be a OOV energy .
But in the case of the appropriate OOV of OOV from OOV OOV OOV , then OOV , we are in the field of OOV energy .
You know that this was the subject of a debate in this Parliament and also that , in the end , a OOV was OOV by which we agreed to OOV a particular OOV of OOV in certain OOV and under certain conditions .
But if you just say OOV and that is all , then I will say no .
OOV OOV OOV in a particular way and , of course , OOV and OOV .
<P> OOV regard to Mr OOV ' s OOV , he OOV what the Treaty OOV , and , of course , the decision to set up a OOV OOV OOV or not or to OOV out is up to the Member States ; it is not up to the Commission and OOV is it a Community decision .
It is the Member States that take their own decisions OOV to their own OOV , within the general framework , of course , which does not OOV that I do not believe we should think OOV about it , because I believe Europe needs a common energy policy .
<SPEAKER OOV NAME=" President " > As the time OOV to OOV to Commissioner OOV OOV has OOV , OOV OOV OOV , OOV and OOV will be OOV to in OOV .
<SPEAKER OOV NAME=" OOV " > Mr President , on a point of order .
I want an OOV to my question .
You OOV over my OOV OOV .
I am here to take the question .
I must OOV the OOV to that question .
<P> OOV , may I point out that in OOV OOV there were three OOV in one , which OOV up over OOV OOV .
There are three OOV in one in OOV OOV , which will take another OOV OOV or so .
OOV OOV OOV is one OOV OOV and all I OOV is one OOV OOV .
<P> I am OOV to that .
I therefore OOV you , Mr President , to OOV me the respect of the House and the OOV to my question .
I have been here for the last OOV years and I am at least OOV to the respect of the House .
<SPEAKER OOV NAME=" President " > Mr OOV , the House has every respect for you , but the OOV OOV of a Member - especially those of us who have been here for many years - is to OOV the OOV of OOV .
There is an order of OOV .
You will OOV that I have been OOV OOV OOV now for a year and a OOV , and out of OOV I have had to OOV this part of the OOV .
OOV Commissioner OOV for OOV OOV .
OOV question is No OOV .
OOV OOV and OOV did not OOV an OOV OOV in OOV with the OOV , and their OOV were also present .
There is not going to be debate on this now , I OOV you , because it would OOV Members from being able to ask their OOV .
So in OOV with the OOV , OOV OOV , " OOV to OOV " , OOV OOV : " OOV that OOV OOV for OOV of time shall be OOV in OOV . "
That is what I have done , and I am OOV the same OOV to you as to OOV OOV .
<P> In other words , you are being OOV OOV and OOV respect .
If you have OOV OOV to OOV , OOV do so in OOV .
Mr OOV , who is OOV a point of order , OOV a question that was not OOV , because it was not OOV .
This is the view of the presidency of this OOV and I do not OOV to OOV it further .
<SPEAKER OOV NAME=" OOV OOV OOV OOV OOV > OOV No OOV by OOV ) : <P> OOV : OOV and OOV of development services and policy The Commission has OOV on the process of OOV in the field of development policy , in the OOV of which the role of OOV will need to be OOV .
The European Parliament OOV that OOV are one of the OOV on which Community cooperation OOV and is concerned at the OOV of OOV in the new OOV and OOV plan for development policy and services .
<P> OOV the Commission OOV a OOV OOV OOV with the European OOV OOV Committee ( OOV ) which will OOV the terms OOV the OOV of European OOV in Community cooperation ?
<P> OOV the Commission believe that it is important to OOV the role of OOV with a view to OOV their OOV in Community development policy by OOV with OOV aid organisations , OOV those OOV to the United OOV OOV ?
<P> OOV the Commission take account of the OOV with OOV OOV by OOV in the OOV OOV when it OOV up the OOV plan for the new OOV OOV ?
<SPEAKER OOV NAME=" OOV " > The Commission fully OOV with the OOV Member that OOV as important OOV in civil society are one of the OOV on which OOV cooperation OOV .
The OOV OOV OOV OOV the OOV role of OOV OOV in the development process .
<P> The Commission has OOV specific OOV OOV on the role of OOV such as OOV in the EU OOV with the OOV countries .
The Commission action plan also OOV OOV to OOV with the OOV
The Commission action plan also OOV OOV to OOV and OOV of civil society and OOV OOV .
<P> As far as the European OOV OOV Committee ( OOV ) is concerned , our OOV with it has always been OOV and OOV .
In OOV to OOV to OOV OOV , OOV that actually OOV people in the OOV countries , the OOV is also OOV OOV by the Commission .
In OOV with its financial rules the Commission OOV the OOV results of an OOV of the OOV in OOV 2000 , which OOV OOV financial management within the OOV
The Commission will OOV the OOV of this OOV in order to put its OOV with the OOV on a OOV basis .
However , it should be mentioned that the OOV between the Commission and the OOV is not and will not be OOV .
<P> The OOV with a number of other OOV and other OOV OOV organisations - there is a number of them - also will be OOV over the next year as the new OOV OOV OOV in OOV 2000 OOV into place .
<P> On this matter it is important to ask you not to make the OOV of OOV that OOV a OOV OOV OOV of financial management for the OOV is an OOV way by which the Commission should OOV its positive OOV towards the OOV of civil society as such .
This is not the problem , the problem we are OOV here is OOV one of financial management .
<P> The Commission OOV that OOV have a OOV and OOV role , which is different from and not in OOV with OOV OOV .
<P> OOV 's use of OOV , the OOV and other organisations OOV what is best in the situation .
OOV change and so does the OOV of how we OOV through different OOV .
<P> Finally , many of the OOV with OOV of OOV in the OOV OOV have now been OOV to the OOV OOV OOV - our new OOV OOV .
OOV they will OOV their OOV to the new OOV and OOV on how to OOV the OOV better to OOV some of the problems we have had in the OOV with the not always very OOV OOV between the different parties .
<SPEAKER OOV LANGUAGE="ES " NAME=" OOV OOV OOV OOV > I am OOV for what has OOV , because I OOV , or I think I OOV the Commissioner say that he will OOV up the OOV and continue to regard OOV as important , but in this OOV I should like to ask the following question : clearly , Commissioner , we as Members of Parliament , and OOV the OOV Group , are not going to OOV or OOV the possible OOV management by the OOV OOV Committee ( OOV ) , but we do think that the political principle of OOV with the OOV is very important , and a OOV OOV of these OOV is OOV by the OOV
<P> OOV , we OOV that the OOV that may be OOV is not in OOV to the OOV of the OOV that the OOV OOV may have OOV , and that if a way out of the current situation is not OOV the OOV OOV Committee may OOV .
<P> The question is , therefore : does the Commissioner OOV a way out of the financial situation without OOV the fact that the Commission should then OOV a OOV or new way in which the OOV must work and how they must OOV themselves ?
<SPEAKER OOV NAME=" OOV " > We will make the OOV of OOV to this problem that we have OOV for the OOV so far .
OOV me here make the point that we are not at the OOV OOV , we have OOV the report from the OOV and we are OOV at what OOV of OOV we will OOV in the Commission .
<P> But we have OOV - and this OOV what the OOV are OOV - that there is a need to OOV something OOV EUR OOV million .
That OOV OOV also OOV to a OOV in the OOV of the OOV in question .
This is OOV OOV .
I am OOV with a situation where if I do not do this I would be OOV in a OOV which would in all OOV be OOV OOV by the Court of OOV and by this House .
<P> I still OOV the very OOV OOV I OOV at my OOV in the Committee on OOV and OOV a year and a OOV OOV when I said that I and this Commission would take the OOV of a OOV OOV policy OOV to OOV and all these problems .
OOV OOV on that and what I am OOV now is following OOV OOV , to the OOV that we have such a OOV in the Commission .
But here I am on clear OOV .
I am aware of the problem that Mrs OOV has OOV and we are OOV OOV we can to find a OOV which will OOV the OOV of the cooperation with the OOV world to continue .
<P> But if some OOV of OOV is necessary , this is a OOV they may have to go through .
For the time being I am very OOV not to OOV what the OOV OOV to be because it is very much in the OOV of the OOV of OOV and the many different OOV all over Europe .
But we are not OOV our OOV on them and we OOV and hope that future cooperation will be OOV and OOV .
<SPEAKER OOV NAME=" President " > <SPEAKER OOV NAME=" OOV OOV " > OOV No OOV by OOV ) : <P> OOV : OOV to OOV OOV out of the OOV OOV OOV attention should be OOV to the OOV , OOV and OOV OOV against the OOV OOV of the OOV OOV in OOV by OOV OOV , especially on the OOV of OOV , which has OOV in the OOV and OOV of OOV , OOV being OOV to OOV OOV OOV , and a OOV number of OOV .
I have OOV OOV the OOV OOV OOV from OOV together with OOV OOV OOV .
The situation is OOV .
The OOV Government and OOV are OOV to OOV their citizens ' safety and OOV , OOV of which OOV they OOV .
<P> What OOV and measures has the Commission taken to provide aid to OOV the OOV of OOV OOV from their OOV in the OOV OOV , particularly on OOV , in the very OOV situation in which they find themselves ?
<SPEAKER OOV NAME=" OOV " > OOV OOV the first OOV in the OOV in OOV OOV when an aid OOV of EUR OOV million made it possible to set up OOV health and OOV OOV programmes for OOV people from the OOV and OOV OOV .
The financial decision for OOV was OOV in OOV OOV and EUR OOV OOV were used for the OOV of these two programmes .
OOV further OOV OOV with a OOV of EUR OOV million OOV in OOV 2000 because the number of OOV OOV OOV to OOV .
These OOV OOV the OOV of OOV and first aid and the OOV also OOV OOV aid and a OOV of OOV OOV to the OOV OOV from the OOV .
As the conflict has OOV the OOV of the OOV OOV and particularly the OOV of OOV the two OOV OOV by OOV in OOV , OOV OOV OOV , OOV , and OOV OOV OOV OOV , OOV , have OOV their action to OOV OOV OOV from this OOV .
The OOV of OOV in OOV and OOV last year OOV new OOV all over the OOV .

It is OOV a new programme of OOV for OOV OOV with a OOV of EUR OOV OOV which OOV OOV of OOV and first aid .
OOV OOV OOV is OOV out this programme .
<P> OOV that the situation in the OOV OOV a OOV for OOV concern , a new OOV aid decision of OOV OOV was OOV on OOV OOV 2000 .

It also OOV a OOV OOV at OOV the transport of OOV OOV which will be OOV out by the international committee of the OOV OOV .
<P> So , we are OOV high priority to OOV the people who are the OOV of this very OOV conflict .
<SPEAKER OOV LANGUAGE="SV" NAME=" OOV " > I should like to thank Commissioner OOV for his OOV and for the efforts being made on behalf of all OOV OOV in the OOV OOV where the OOV group is OOV OOV OOV .
We are concerned here with a OOV of OOV OOV OOV out of a OOV of OOV million people .
It is as if all the OOV of OOV s third OOV OOV , OOV , were to be OOV as OOV .
<P> I also want to OOV the OOV of the situation for the OOV OOV in OOV .
On OOV OOV , a OOV number of OOV OOV OOV against OOV - including the OOV in the OOV , OOV - OOV place at a OOV of OOV in the OOV OOV .
<P> OOV is the world ' s OOV OOV country in terms of OOV , as well as being the most OOV OOV OOV country .
I OOV you are following OOV there very OOV .
<P> OOV specific question is this : are there OOV with OOV , the OOV OOV OOV and the OOV Council of OOV with a view to OOV aid to the OOV OOV OOV , OOV all in the OOV OOV ? <SPEAKER OOV OOV NAME=" OOV " > I can OOV the last question by OOV that the organisations concerned are those I OOV to as our OOV in OOV OOV aid .
I would also OOV that a conflict of this OOV could OOV if , as OOV of OOV aid , we were to OOV as OOV to help us OOV the aid , organisations which could be OOV as not being OOV in the conflict .
We are OOV to OOV this further problem .
I OOV the OOV of the conflict very well indeed , as well as the OOV OOV with the conflict because of its OOV , but I believe that , in OOV out the OOV before us , what we are OOV is right .
<SPEAKER OOV NAME=" OOV " > This aid is very OOV on the one hand , but , could it not also be OOV the OOV Government OOV the OOV ; and should we really not use the political and economic OOV of the European Union to OOV the OOV Government to look after its own citizens , especially this OOV OOV ?
<SPEAKER OOV NAME=" OOV " > There are a number of OOV within OOV .
They are not all of the same OOV .
This one is different from those OOV that have OOV from the issue of OOV , OOV up OOV .
In fact , we are OOV with the OOV Government , OOV not only to OOV but also to OOV them in a OOV OOV to do what a government OOV to do in OOV a problem of this OOV .
<P> There is , in my view , a OOV between this conflict and the other OOV in OOV and also some OOV in the OOV of the OOV of the OOV Government .
OOV there is the basis of OOV good cooperation with the Government of OOV .
But the conflict itself is extremely OOV and very OOV for OOV , especially the OOV of course .
<SPEAKER OOV NAME=" President " > <SPEAKER OOV NAME=" OOV OOV " > OOV No OOV by OOV ) : <P> OOV : OOV of OOV OOV in OOV The OOV situation in the OOV for OOV OOV does not OOV to have OOV , OOV to reports OOV from the OOV OOV ( OOV ) , and there are also OOV that OOV are being made to OOV OOV OOV OOV in OOV .
<P> OOV into account the resolution adopted by the OOV OOV OOV OOV OOV ) ,
especially OOV OOV OOV in which it OOV OOV the Commission , the Council and the OOV of the Member States in international organisations to take , as a matter of OOV , the necessary measures to OOV the situation in the OOV for OOV OOV OOV in OOV " , and OOV in OOV that the OOV resolution was adopted OOV OOV OOV , can the Commission say what measures it has taken to OOV with OOV OOV of resolution OOV OOV ? <SPEAKER OOV NAME=" OOV " > I am OOV to OOV the OOV Member and this House that the Commission has taken and OOV to take appropriate measures in OOV to the OOV and OOV situation of OOV OOV in OOV .
<P> I OOV OOV in OOV 2000 and on that OOV I also OOV to see OOV with OOV from OOV .
The OOV number of OOV in OOV , including those from OOV , OOV to OOV .
OOV the end of 2000 there were OOV OOV OOV OOV in OOV in OOV OOV of OOV OOV OOV OOV were OOV , OOV OOV OOV and the OOV OOV , OOV and other OOV .
<P> OOV OOV the Commission funds more than one third of the OOV OOV aid available to OOV in OOV .
In the year 2000 , OOV 's OOV for aid to OOV OOV was EUR OOV OOV .
OOV 's level of support is OOV to OOV OOV the same this year .
The OOV OOV in OOV are the OOV OOV of the OOV OOV and OOV OOV , the OOV , OOV and the OOV OOV OOV .
The main OOV of the OOV aid are OOV OOV of OOV , OOV , education , health OOV for OOV and OOV , public health , OOV and OOV in the OOV .
<P> As to the OOV of OOV OOV the OOV , OOV OOV one third of the OOV OOV of the OOV OOV OOV in OOV , which OOV a OOV OOV OOV of OOV OOV OOV OOV , well over the OOV OOV by the OOV .
The OOV OOV OOV the international OOV to OOV problems of OOV , which would be OOV to OOV in OOV from OOV other than the Commission , and OOV OOV were OOV OOV to OOV % .
However , the OOV OOV OOV in view of the fact that many OOV have OOV to OOV OOV of OOV .
<P> In OOV , OOV OOV the international OOV OOV by OOV a programme to improve OOV OOV OOV the most OOV OOV .
In OOV with OOV , OOV OOV OOV OOV OOV in OOV of the OOV with OOV and hand OOV in order to OOV OOV and OOV OOV OOV .
OOV was given and OOV OOV that more than OOV OOV people have OOV OOV from the OOV .
I have OOV this programme and it is in fact so OOV and so OOV that the OOV that we can OOV the OOV when they OOV OOV much less OOV .
But , of course , this is what we are going to support .
<P> OOV the possible OOV of OOV OOV in OOV following the OOV of the peace agreement at the OOV OOV , the Commission is OOV a state of OOV for this OOV .
I was OOV present at the OOV OOV ' OOV OOV by OOV OOV in OOV in OOV , which OOV the peace agreement .
The Commission is OOV a OOV approach .
OOV , the current level of OOV OOV to OOV will be OOV OOV they OOV in OOV .
OOV , should the conditions be OOV for their OOV - and we are OOV OOV concerned and some who do not think they should be concerned to make this OOV - then the funds OOV by OOV to the OOV programme will OOV the OOV back OOV .
<P> OOV OOV OOV of EUR OOV million has been OOV by the OOV OOV under the OOV OOV 's OOV OOV to OOV OOV in a OOV and OOV OOV .
At this OOV , the OOV for an OOV and OOV OOV OOV are not OOV .
This was OOV in OOV 's OOV OOV OOV meeting with OOV in OOV when it was agreed that OOV may only take place if all parties are OOV that the security situation OOV OOV is OOV and OOV .
This is a major OOV of OOV and we want to OOV it through to a OOV OOV .
<SPEAKER OOV LANGUAGE="ES " NAME=" OOV " > Commissioner , I think it only OOV to thank you for such an OOV OOV , which to a certain OOV OOV me .
OOV the same OOV as you are OOV , I think , because there is no OOV that the problems of these OOV OOV in OOV are OOV .
<P> We had the OOV OOV OOV report , which said that OOV OOV would OOV out by the end of the year .
There is also the need to provide for the OOV and education of all these OOV , even OOV they are in an OOV situation in their OOV , OOV so that these years should not be OOV years .
OOV , not only is it OOV to give OOV OOV aid , but education programmes and health programmes are also OOV so that these OOV years for this people will not be OOV years but can be the OOV point for better OOV and especially for the OOV OOV of the OOV people .
<SPEAKER OOV NAME=" President " > <SPEAKER OOV NAME=" OOV OOV " > OOV No OOV by OOV ) : <P> OOV : OOV OOV and OOV in the OOV OOV OOV does the OOV OOV OOV to OOV with the Swedish Presidency on issues OOV to conflict OOV and OOV in OOV countries ?
<SPEAKER OOV NAME=" OOV " > OOV OOV and conflict OOV , management and resolution continue to have a high priority in our OOV , and the Commission OOV the importance OOV to those issues by the Swedish Presidency .
<P> OOV and OOV OOV are OOV OOV for economic and social progress .
OOV OOV is an OOV part of the EU 's OOV policy OOV .
The OOV is now to OOV in OOV terms the OOV OOV of OOV and to OOV on OOV and the implementation of OOV .
<P> The EU 's contribution to conflict OOV is OOV where we can use or OOV our different OOV , especially trade and cooperation OOV , development OOV and social and environmental OOV , to OOV OOV of conflict .
<P> The last OOV Council , by OOV the OOV of development policy on OOV OOV , has OOV the basis for OOV one of the major OOV of conflict - the OOV of OOV in OOV and OOV .
<P> OOV me again OOV that the OOV initiative OOV the OOV of the OOV countries is also a very real contribution to conflict OOV .
OOV , the OOV level of development OOV is , in my view , the OOV OOV issue that needs to be OOV if we are to be serious about conflict OOV .
<P> The Commission has already had OOV OOV with the Swedish Presidency and we OOV their concerns .
It was , for example , OOV to have a policy debate on conflict OOV in the OOV OOV Council on OOV OOV .
We agreed that we OOV to OOV the OOV of conflict OOV in OOV policy OOV to OOV cooperation with the United OOV , the OOV and other regional organisations and to find common OOV to OOV OOV of OOV such as the trade in OOV , OOV or OOV .
We really need better OOV in these OOV , of course .
<P> The Commission will present a OOV on conflict OOV this OOV .
It is fully aware of the OOV role of development cooperation in this OOV .
We will work OOV with the Swedish Presidency to OOV conflict OOV and OOV at the OOV of our OOV .
<SPEAKER OOV NAME=" OOV " > Mr President , Commissioner , the OOV is , of course , very OOV but I OOV if you were aware Commissioner that the OOV policy OOV and OOV OOV OOV in the Commission has OOV OOV , OOV of OOV are responsible for the OOV and only one responsible for OOV which is your responsibility .
I OOV if you would look at that issue and OOV to ensure that we have more OOV on the OOV in these OOV .
<P> OOV , are you aware that they OOV on OOV OOV which means that they cannot make OOV OOV of the OOV that you OOV now , so it is important that the Commission OOV at these issues .
OOV , Commissioner , the whole matter of OOV to the OOV : will you be OOV that in the OOV you have OOV of OOV with OOV to deal with conflict OOV and peace OOV ?
<SPEAKER OOV NAME=" OOV " > The OOV is in all OOV OOV , and OOV OOV that the Commission is not in a position , OOV , to give a good OOV to this OOV of question .
We are in the OOV of Members States and this House in our OOV to get enough OOV , OOV OOV , to do what we are OOV and OOV to do .
But , I am not able to say , OOV " we will do this as Mrs OOV and I would like .
That is not so OOV .
<P> On the OOV of people OOV as to their OOV in the OOV OOV group and the political OOV we have OOV to do these things better , I do not think it can be OOV only in that way .
OOV with the new OOV the more OOV , general OOV of relations with the OOV countries for OOV , the OOV OOV will be given more OOV as the OOV of OOV OOV between the OOV OOV and the new cooperation OOV .
This is part of our own OOV to these OOV , and that is OOV the way I will OOV to improve our OOV , even on the basis of the given resources .
<SPEAKER OOV NAME=" President " > As the time OOV to OOV to Mr OOV has OOV , OOV OOV OOV to OOV will be OOV in OOV .
<P> That OOV OOV to the Commission .
<P> ( The OOV was OOV at OOV OOV and OOV at OOV OOV ) OOV OOV OOV fisheries policy <SPEAKER OOV NAME=" President " > The next OOV is the OOV debate on the following reports : <P> OOV by Mr OOV OOV , on behalf of the Committee on OOV , on the common fisheries policy and the OOV of economic OOV OOV OOV ; <P> OOV by Mr OOV , on behalf of the Committee on OOV , on the Commission report to the Council and the European Parliament on the OOV of the Community system for fisheries and OOV in OOV OOV ) OOV - OOV - OOV ; <P> OOV by Mr OOV , on behalf of the Committee on OOV , on the Commission report on the regional OOV OOV by the Commission in OOV on the common fisheries policy after OOV OOV ) OOV - OOV - OOV ; <P> OOV by Mr OOV , on behalf of the Committee on OOV , on the proposal for a Council decision OOV the terms for financial support to OOV in the fisheries sector ( OOV OOV ) OOV - OOV - OOV ; <P> and on the Commission OOV on the fisheries agreement between the European Union and the OOV of OOV .
<P> The OOV of the Committee on OOV , Mr OOV OOV , has the OOV to OOV a point of order .
<SPEAKER OOV LANGUAGE="ES " OOV OOV " > Mr President , on behalf of the Committee on OOV , because OOV we OOV this subject in committee , and especially also on behalf of all the OOV of the reports we are to OOV today , and if the Commissioner , with OOV I have OOV , has no OOV , and it OOV he has not , I should like to ask you if we might first OOV the OOV from the Commissioner OOV and then we the OOV could OOV in the order OOV down .
That is what I should like to ask you , Mr President .
<SPEAKER OOV LANGUAGE="ES " NAME=" OOV OOV " > Mr President , I am not going to OOV about OOV that we are going to debate now , and I OOV for OOV from the OOV .
This very OOV I have OOV that OOV OOV of the OOV OOV , OOV , OOV OOV OOV , have been OOV by the military authorities of the OOV of OOV , because they were OOV to get OOV the OOV OOV with a OOV OOV what I believe OOV OOV : that the OOV should not be OOV by OOV energy .
<P> These OOV are still under OOV , and since Parliament has been , OOV us say , rather OOV about OOV the interests of the citizens of the OOV OOV OOV and OOV OOV , I ask at least that appropriate OOV should be taken so that these OOV OOV can OOV in their own OOV .
OOV you very much .
<SPEAKER OOV NAME=" President " > Mr OOV OOV , as for OOV in their own OOV , I am not OOV if it is OOV that we could achieve that from here at this time , but we take good OOV of your OOV , which will OOV in the OOV , since I OOV you would also like that to OOV .
<P> Mr OOV OOV may take the OOV .
<SPEAKER OOV LANGUAGE="ES " NAME=" OOV OOV " > Mr President , it OOV appropriate to me that Commissioner OOV should come before this Parliament today to deal with the OOV question .
I think it is OOV appropriate .
<P> What I think is OOV OOV is to have OOV a debate on OOV OOV that the Committee on OOV OOV OOV important for the future of the common fisheries policy with a debate on the OOV question , which will OOV take over from the other OOV OOV .
<P> I think these are two OOV OOV OOV , which should have taken place at OOV OOV during this OOV OOV , and each one should have been given the importance it OOV .
As that has not OOV , we Members OOV all who have OOV time will be OOV OOV not to OOV about OOV or not to OOV about the other reports and OOV the future of the common fisheries policy , and both OOV are OOV .
<SPEAKER OOV NAME=" President " > Mr OOV , our working conditions are OOV in general .
We are OOV to improve them so that the OOV can be OOV more OOV .
You are aware that there is a working OOV by the OOV to OOV this subject .
But on the specific point that you OOV , OOV from taking OOV as is my OOV , I can OOV you that your group OOV in favour of this proposal at the OOV of OOV .
OOV , I OOV your OOV , but I would be OOV if you would also OOV them on to the OOV of your own group .
<P> Mr OOV has the OOV .
<SPEAKER OOV NAME=" OOV > Mr President , I wish to use this point of order to state that I OOV the issue OOV by Mr OOV OOV , but this is a question of OOV , as the President said .
We must OOV this .
This is OOV why I OOV and support the issue OOV by the OOV of our Committee on OOV , Mr OOV OOV .
The OOV of the matter is that the OOV situation is an extremely important issue for many of us and it would be appropriate for the Commissioner to OOV right at the OOV of the debate on this issue .
I would say that , given the political importance of the OOV question , OOV OOV to OOV on the OOV is of OOV importance .
I therefore think that it would make OOV to OOV the debate as I have OOV .
<SPEAKER OOV NAME=" President " > OOV you , Mr OOV .
I think the best OOV to do is to OOV to the debate , and if there is no OOV I shall take up the proposal by the OOV of the Committee on OOV .
So , Mr OOV , the OOV is OOV .
<SPEAKER OOV LANGUAGE="DE " NAME=" OOV " > Mr President , OOV Members , I am , of course , OOV OOV to start by making the OOV OOV on fisheries relations between the Union and OOV .
As you OOV already know from the OOV , negotiations on a new form of OOV in the fisheries sector were OOV with the OOV of OOV following my OOV to OOV in OOV , when the OOV of OOV agreed to OOV serious negotiations .
As a result , a OOV of OOV OOV of OOV negotiations OOV place between OOV OOV and OOV OOV .
<P> I then OOV OOV OOV OOV and OOV OOV OOV for OOV OOV at the OOV of OOV - once for three OOV and once for two OOV .
I OOV great OOV to ensure that both OOV OOV the main OOV of future fisheries relations , especially with regard to fishing OOV , the OOV of the agreement , OOV fishing conditions and , most OOV , financial OOV .
<P> OOV were OOV OOV every OOV between the first and second political OOV this year , more OOV at OOV level .
We have done a great deal of OOV work and OOV OOV have been OOV .
The Commission has OOV OOV the negotiations to OOV to be as OOV as it OOV it can be on OOV 's main OOV , especially as OOV the OOV of fishing OOV and OOV OOV in OOV OOV .
<P> We have OOV from the start that we are OOV both to take account of OOV interests and to support the development of the OOV fisheries sector .
We have also made clear time and again that we want to OOV the Community 's social and economic interests and are OOV for help in OOV resources .
OOV , the OOV OOV OOV OOV a very OOV OOV during my second OOV on OOV and OOV OOV , especially on the important OOV of fishing OOV and OOV terms , and made OOV OOV for financial OOV .
I OOV to OOV the OOV OOV to OOV its position , because an agreement was not on the OOV on this basis , and I OOV them to OOV OOV as OOV as possible in a OOV to OOV a OOV agreement .
<P> We are OOV to OOV a OOV OOV for a OOV agreement , but the OOV must be in OOV to the fishing OOV OOV by OOV and I have always clearly given the OOV OOV to OOV as much .
If our OOV OOV are now OOV to OOV to the OOV OOV and OOV OOV to OOV , then I am OOV that , in the end , we shall OOV a OOV which is OOV to both OOV .
<P> Finally , I should like to point out that the question of cooperation with OOV in the fisheries sector was one of the main points on the OOV for President OOV 's OOV to OOV , when both OOV OOV the opportunity of OOV their wish to OOV an agreement .
It was therefore agreed that we should OOV negotiations at a OOV level as OOV as possible .
<SPEAKER OOV NAME=" President " > OOV you , Commissioner .
It is now the OOV of the OOV , and I should like to OOV them that , OOV the OOV , they are OOV and they have to present their reports .
OOV , Mr OOV OOV .
<SPEAKER OOV LANGUAGE="ES " OOV OOV " > Mr President , thank you very much for your OOV .
I wish to thank Mr OOV for his OOV on the fisheries agreement with OOV , and I also wish to thank OOV for all the OOV he is OOV into these difficult negotiations .
We all OOV they would be difficult and OOV .
<P> I should like to OOV you here , as he too has said , but I want to OOV this , that it is the first time that a President of the European Commission has been OOV involved in OOV a fisheries agreement .
It must be clear both to the citizens of the European Union and to OOV that all the OOV in the European Union - and at the OOV level - want this agreement : the European Council OOV it , and it said so at OOV ; the President of the Commission , who has been to OOV , OOV it ; and the European Parliament in OOV OOV it .
<P> So , for the time being , the one that does not want it , and I say for the time being , is OOV , at least on the terms that the European Union is OOV .
OOV us hope that together we can OOV OOV to OOV them of the OOV OOV of this agreement and OOV be able to OOV President OOV with this OOV .
I just ask , Mr OOV , that the negotiations be OOV as OOV as possible - OOV if they can be - to make the most of the OOV that the President of the European Commission OOV has given them .
<P> As has also been said here , I do not want OOV to OOV our attention OOV from the extremely important debate that we have here today .
We have been OOV to debate OOV major reports to do with the common fisheries policy and its future .
I am going to OOV , OOV , on OOV , the one for which I am the rapporteur , but first I should like to OOV Mr OOV and Mr OOV and also Mr OOV on the OOV OOV they have done .
<P> I want to point out in OOV to the report for which I am the rapporteur that I think it is the first one that a Community OOV has OOV up on OOV in fisheries , and therefore I think our Committee has OOV the OOV on the OOV with the two OOV reports it has OOV to OOV ; the other one is still in progress .
In OOV , in this report , what I want to OOV is this : first of all , Commissioner , the fishing industry in the European Union must start to OOV OOV this OOV OOV or OOV OOV OOV that it OOV has , OOV because of the fact that it is OOV to OOV regions or because of the OOV of the Community OOV contribution OOV that are always being mentioned .
<P> We have to OOV the OOV importance that fishing now has .
We are OOV more and more OOV on OOV OOV ; we have our own OOV on all the OOV and we have enough OOV OOV of our own not to OOV this OOV sector in the OOV of third countries .
<P> The OOV OOV , therefore , must not OOV just for us to OOV on OOV at our own OOV in the form of our own Community OOV , our own problems and our own OOV .
What we really need is a OOV of the right OOV that is OOV at European and world OOV .
OOV OOV does not OOV more OOV but OOV more OOV at OOV the resources actually available , and OOV this better than OOV OOV .
<P> The fishing sector is now OOV - and will be more so in the future - as a OOV OOV : OOV and OOV OOV OOV for a OOV human OOV .
We must OOV fisheries - and this is also OOV by the fisheries agreement with OOV - in the European Union ' s OOV policy and OOV policy .
OOV Union ' s OOV fisheries policy has to OOV OOV and an OOV , which it does not yet have , OOV before world public opinion as it really is : the policy of a fishing OOV as OOV as any other with the United OOV OOV , that is , the development of the international law of the OOV , the OOV of resources for all , cooperation for development , OOV . <P> OOV us therefore make it an OOV policy , both in fisheries OOV with third countries , OOV to each OOV situation , and in the regional OOV organisations , in which we must OOV a OOV role , as we have often said , and OOV us not OOV OOV to a situation in which the OOV OOV that today make up the European Union - OOV OOV OOV or OOV - must OOV have as much OOV as , for OOV , OOV has now .
The Council of OOV of the European Union or the United OOV OOV Council are OOV to OOV in OOV of OOV systems OOV by the specific OOV of OOV and OOV , and we should OOV this important example in OOV .
<P> OOV report OOV that the European Union has not yet OOV up to the importance of its OOV concerns at an international level .
OOV , as I said OOV , its OOV importance to the Community OOV is small , but we must not OOV that OOV is the OOV OOV OOV in the world .
If we OOV up the OOV and OOV industry , OOV OOV , OOV in other countries and OOV OOV , EU OOV economic OOV is the most OOV in the world .
OOV OOV , like the United States and OOV , are aware of this and are OOV in this sector .
<P> In the OOV OOV OOV we must not be OOV to OOV up for our interests , and for our OOV aid system too , since not all of it OOV OOV to fishing : some is aid for OOV and OOV resources , making OOV OOV , OOV OOV OOV and the OOV OOV of fishing .
In the OOV we must OOV the real OOV of OOV services , the OOV to OOV and OOV in third countries with full legal OOV and OOV of OOV to OOV .
OOV us OOV OOV to OOV OOV economic OOV and OOV the OOV OOV against OOV of OOV .
<P> OOV this , ladies and gentlemen , Commissioner , is the real OOV OOV the common fisheries policy from economic OOV .
<P> The European Parliament is today OOV this report to which I OOV as OOV for OOV for OOV on the OOV of an OOV OOV of the common fisheries policy , so that we can all be clear about where we are and where we have to get to .
<SPEAKER OOV NAME=" OOV " > Mr President , Commissioner , at the OOV I want to OOV the OOV which I OOV from the OOV of the Committee on OOV and indeed from the OOV of my own group in OOV this report .
I want to thank Mr OOV for his cooperation OOV OOV my report .
<P> OOV OOV and Mr OOV had one major OOV - to make OOV that our reports were not only OOV , but more OOV that they were not OOV .
OOV all they deal with the same subject , and I would like to think that the same OOV will OOV in the House when both reports are OOV on OOV .
<P> OOV the OOV OOV a Community system for fisheries and OOV , the Commission is OOV to report at least every three years to Parliament , the Council and the Community OOV OOV the sector on the implementation of measures and OOV in the common fisheries policy .
This report OOV the years OOV to OOV .
The OOV of the present OOV OOV it a OOV OOV in that it OOV a OOV to the OOV OOV to be OOV on the OOV of the common fisheries policy .
OOV only is this is an OOV OOV of the OOV , it is an important OOV of the OOV of Commission OOV about the future and OOV of the OOV after OOV .
This , of course , is to be OOV .
<P> The report OOV all OOV of the OOV , including OOV and management of resources , OOV policy , OOV fisheries policy , market policy and OOV and OOV .
<P> In the OOV to its OOV the Commission OOV OOV its OOV : better OOV between the various OOV OOV by the OOV , such as OOV of resources , the economic OOV of the OOV and OOV employment in fisheries - OOV areas , taking account of the economic OOV of fisheries management , better OOV of environmental and fisheries policy , OOV of management OOV such as OOV management OOV and OOV , management of fishing OOV , and full OOV of the Mediterranean into the Community management OOV , a more OOV OOV process and OOV the OOV OOV of the common fisheries policy .
<P> OOV of these points can be OOV by us , indeed as the Commission OOV , a number of these OOV are those which Parliament itself set and has long OOV .
I would like to OOV to you , as I have done in my report , a number of points that I feel OOV about .
I OOV the present OOV state of OOV OOV in OOV to OOV OOV measures .
I believe that more progress can still be made .
In OOV of OOV taken by the Commission to OOV its OOV with the industry , I believe that these should be fully OOV .
I believe that OOV must be more involved in the work of OOV in order to OOV OOV OOV .
I have OOV OOV that OOV programmes have OOV in a OOV OOV without OOV any major OOV to the fishing sector as a whole .
<P> I would like to see a OOV OOV OOV OOV the Community and the OOV of OOV for OOV .
I want a OOV OOV of the Community OOV system with regard to third country OOV OOV within EU OOV .
I am OOV in favour of a greater OOV of the common fisheries policy through the OOV of a OOV OOV of regional management OOV and regional OOV OOV OOV on the use of OOV areas and OOV to OOV the OOV OOV .
In this OOV , I want to OOV that OOV of fisheries policy is not in any way the same as OOV or fisheries policy .
It does , however , to use the Commission 's own words , OOV the OOV of OOV , and I OOV OOV all the three OOV of the management process OOV OOV . OOV , OOV and implementation of decisions taken " .
<P> I believe that the OOV of OOV in the regional OOV of the OOV must OOV OOV to a OOV of OOV in the policy and in the Community OOV .
I believe that it is necessary to OOV the OOV of the OOV in a clear and OOV OOV , OOV out a OOV system of OOV .
I am OOV that this must OOV such OOV as OOV OOV between OOV , OOV , the OOV of the OOV OOV in areas OOV OOV on fisheries , OOV and OOV .
As I have done on so many OOV in the OOV , I OOV my call that in order to ensure an appropriate policy of OOV it is OOV to OOV OOV to the OOV OOV of OOV OOV as the OOV OOV OOV of the OOV States and to OOV this OOV to OOV OOV , as OOV agreed by this House in OOV OOV .
<P> On a OOV OOV I would point out that these last two issues are OOV to my own country , OOV .
I believe that the OOV respect must be OOV to the need for social , economic , regional OOV , and that the OOV priority must be given to the OOV of the OOV of regions OOV OOV on fisheries .
<P> I want to see the Commission OOV the OOV of OOV OOV so as to take better account of the need for economic , social and regional OOV .
There is no OOV in my OOV that this must be done without OOV into question the OOV principle itself .
I would like to take the opportunity to OOV Mr OOV OOV on his report .
The fact that there are no amendments OOV is a clear OOV that we can all agree on this OOV .
I am OOV to say that all the OOV OOV in my opinion on behalf of the Committee on OOV have been OOV in the report in one form or another .
Mr OOV OOV has OOV to us in OOV the importance of the OOV role of the EU fisheries .
This is something that must be taken into account in future OOV negotiations to ensure that EU OOV are not put at a OOV .
The Commission must come up with appropriate OOV proposals .
OOV what was done in OOV to OOV , I would OOV Mr OOV to OOV this House on the fisheries proposals .
<P> In OOV , I am OOV that Mr OOV OOV has OOV the need to take into account social and economic OOV , such as employment in OOV areas .
This must be taken into OOV in the OOV OOV and the OOV of the common fisheries policy , and I welcome the OOV to an environmental and health OOV OOV in Mr OOV OOV 's report .
I also want to OOV my OOV Mr OOV on his report .
<SPEAKER OOV LANGUAGE="FR" NAME=" OOV " > Mr President , the report I am OOV OOV with the regional OOV OOV by the Commission in OOV .
It has been subject to OOV and , at OOV , OOV debate in committee , because it is one of the first reports , like those by Mr OOV , Mr OOV OOV and Mr OOV , to OOV us to consider the common fisheries policy for OOV rather than because it is OOV or OOV to OOV to decisions being made .
<P> This is a OOV subject , OOV a sector with very specific OOV and one which OOV some quite OOV and OOV OOV regions in Europe .
The OOV of the sector OOV OOV a great many OOV both up and OOV , making many regions OOV on fisheries , with no OOV OOV to OOV to in OOV of OOV .
OOV in these regions OOV that OOV OOV OOV will be OOV , since this is the OOV for the common fisheries policy , as in OOV and OOV , as if we OOV a new one every OOV years .
<P> OOV a view to OOV as OOV an opinion as possible in order to OOV for this OOV , which I believe was a good OOV , the Commission OOV a OOV OOV process OOV OOV OOV or involved with this OOV , OOV out OOV and OOV OOV .
OOV OOV were OOV , OOV by OOV OOV OOV people .
<P> OOV regard to the form of OOV , the OOV of the report was OOV .
OOV Members would have OOV not to OOV the subject in too much OOV .
We OOV the matter at great OOV within the OOV committee and , in the end , the Committee on OOV OOV OOV with the opinion of the rapporteur - as , in my view , there really was no other OOV - with OOV able to OOV their own OOV on the subject , just as OOV .
OOV regard to the OOV , however , national and even regional OOV within the Member States were OOV to be more OOV than the rather OOV political OOV , and that is why a number of amendments were OOV .
These amendments OOV that , although the OOV OOV were OOV far OOV , the political debate OOV OOV to be OOV , OOV to an OOV OOV which OOV a OOV OOV point , OOV with the other reports , from which to OOV the OOV of the common fisheries policy .
<P> OOV at the amendments and more OOV , most of the OOV OOV on in committee OOV the rapporteur ' s point of view , with some OOV OOV or OOV .
A OOV OOV is OOV to be OOV in the OOV OOV - at the end of OOV of this year , I believe - OOV by the OOV OOV in the course of OOV .
At the OOV , two main OOV of OOV are OOV .
The first would like to see a OOV OOV of the OOV system and all the OOV , OOV and present , of the common fisheries policy .
The second , OOV OOV a OOV OOV of the OOV OOV , would like to see the system OOV , OOV and OOV so that the fisheries sector can OOV OOV , of course , OOV OOV resources .
OOV OOV , the European fisheries sector has to deal with the problems that most other fishing OOV OOV the world are OOV OOV .
They do not OOV just our OOV or our OOV .
OOV OOV OOV , OOV OOV and OOV , and is the main OOV as far as the future of resources and the fishing industry OOV are concerned .
OOV OOV , OOV with the OOV of the market in OOV OOV , is a further problem .
<P> If the fisheries industry is to become more OOV , it will OOV on the sector ' s OOV to OOV in order to OOV up to the OOV OOV by both the state of its resources and by OOV OOV .
The common fisheries policy is the European Union ' s management OOV for OOV the fisheries industry and OOV .
This policy was OOV up in order to OOV a common OOV and to respect the OOV OOV down in the first European OOV .
<P> The report , therefore , OOV OOV on the OOV OOV of the common fisheries policy , which are OOV and management of resources , OOV policy , market OOV and relations with third countries .
OOV of the main areas of the Union ' s fisheries policy is OOV for OOV .
That is the OOV principle .
The OOV principle , the OOV OOV , so to OOV , is clearly OOV , as is the OOV to OOV a responsible fisheries policy .
<P> In particular , I would like to OOV some OOV , especially OOV the OOV OOV position on the OOV OOV ; OOV OOV after OOV OOV have been OOV out OOV with , OOV , the issue of OOV to the OOV OOV , which will be more difficult in view of our enlargement OOV ; OOV the system of OOV and OOV , on OOV that they be OOV ; OOV OOV OOV OOV OOV and a OOV OOV of the OOV OOV OOV ; OOV OOV and OOV and , of course , OOV to fisheries OOV and action programmes OOV OOV for the Mediterranean .
<P> I should like to OOV by OOV , as Mr OOV said , that we do not wish to see OOV become OOV OOV do we wish for further social measures to be OOV into the common fisheries policy .
OOV Mr OOV and I have given the OOV that we are OOV OOV .
OOV OOV OOV OOV and OOV OOV .
We have OOV to OOV OOV .
<SPEAKER OOV OOV " NAME=" OOV > Mr President , Commissioner , I OOV wish to ask for your OOV so that before I OOV on the subject of my report , I may take a OOV to OOV about OOV .
I should like to OOV OOV Commissioner OOV for the OOV he has OOV in the negotiations to OOV the fishing agreement with OOV , but these OOV should also go to the Commission 's OOV OOV for OOV .
<P> OOV the start of the negotiations we were OOV with OOV on the part of the OOV OOV , who OOV OOV such as " the OOV of fishing OOV " to OOV OOV for the European Union ' s fishing OOV .
However , we know that these were not the real OOV , since they did not OOV the same OOV to other third countries with which they OOV OOV OOV to OOV OOV with various OOV , including some from the European Union .
<P> OOV the importance of the agreement with OOV to the European Union ' s fishing industry , this issue should have OOV been OOV as a matter of great political priority within the European Council itself , in the OOV OOV Council and , of course , in the OOV Council .
OOV OOV is that Commissioner OOV and his OOV OOV OOV OOV in this OOV , OOV from one important but OOV OOV by the President of the Commission .
It is OOV , given that the European Union is OOV to so many OOV of OOV and that we have OOV that country with so many trade OOV to ensure its OOV OOV to our market , that they should have OOV our OOV and cooperation so OOV .
This OOV that the Community authorities at the OOV level had major political OOV OOV to OOV , with the help of those Member States most OOV concerned .
We see now , however , that these OOV were not OOV .
OOV was this the case ?
In time we will see why , but in any OOV , I OOV hope that we can OOV OOV a OOV agreement .
<P> OOV us now OOV to the subject of my report , which is OOV .
The OOV OOV fishing OOV between the European Union and the OOV of OOV was OOV in OOV OOV and OOV into OOV in OOV of that year , OOV OOV OOV OOV this year .
OOV an OOV conflict in that country in OOV , the Commission OOV to the Council and Parliament a proposal for a decision OOV that this agreement be OOV .
Parliament ' s OOV OOV report , at the OOV of OOV , OOV the Commission ' s proposal to be OOV and OOV and OOV a OOV opinion .
Parliament OOV OOV the OOV of the agreement for the OOV of OOV , after which the OOV would be OOV and the Government of OOV would be given help for OOV OOV support OOV for the local fishing industry , for infrastructure and for OOV OOV .
<P> As a result of certain OOV and legal problems OOV by a OOV Commission proposal , the Commission is now OOV a new proposal .
The OOV of this new OOV , as with the OOV one , but OOV a different legal OOV , is to OOV the OOV authorities of OOV a OOV OOV to the OOV part of the financial OOV OOV down in the agreement OOV in OOV , which OOV OOV EUR OOV million and which is OOV OOV for OOV local fishing OOV , for OOV OOV measures and for OOV fisheries infrastructure OOV in the OOV OOV .
<P> On the basis of a programme of OOV OOV by the Government of OOV , the Commission will OOV over OOV % of the OOV that has been OOV for and will OOV the OOV when the government of that country has OOV a OOV report on the progress of the OOV it has OOV and the results that have been OOV .
This report is OOV to be OOV to the Commission by OOV OOV OOV .
The OOV for OOV may , however , have to be OOV if major problems are OOV in the OOV of OOV ' s OOV , that is , its government , following this OOV conflict .
Parliament ' s Committee on OOV has therefore OOV the OOV of OOV OOV OOV as the OOV OOV for the OOV of OOV OOV of the OOV proposal of OOV OOV .
OOV , given that the Commission ' s proposal is OOV the same as the one to which we OOV our OOV in OOV OOV , given that the OOV of OOV OOV is OOV the same and given that the proposal has OOV OOV , I , as rapporteur , feel that Parliament should OOV a OOV opinion on this proposal .
<SPEAKER OOV LANGUAGE="DE " NAME=" OOV " > Mr President , Commissioner , I OOV that we have not OOV OOV more than we can OOV this OOV in the OOV because this first fisheries debate of OOV really is a OOV debate .
It OOV me OOV OOV , Commissioner OOV , to be able to welcome you here today .
For a long time , fisheries OOV were OOV in OOV on OOV .
This year we have done OOV with OOV and OOV the debate forward to OOV , and OOV many Members are still not OOV to us today , you at least are here and I thank you for that .
<P> The new year is a time of hope and OOV , especially for our OOV .
I need only OOV the OOV of the common fisheries policy and the Commission 's OOV OOV OOV OOV .
However , I am OOV to OOV that the OOV OOV on my OOV Members ' OOV and - as far as I can see from here , on your OOV , too , Mr OOV - are still as OOV as OOV .
<P> OOV reason must OOV be the OOV and difficult negotiations on the fisheries agreement with OOV .
I am OOV that there is still no OOV at the end of that particular OOV .
The Commission 's OOV and OOV approach - if I may OOV it OOV - be it on your part , Mr OOV , or on the part of Commission President OOV , has OOV with OOV OOV and OOV no real progress on the other OOV - I am OOV to say the OOV OOV .
I think that is a OOV OOV because I want an agreement although , OOV there be no OOV , I do not want an agreement at any OOV .
<P> The financial framework is OOV and EU OOV must be in OOV to the OOV OOV in OOV .
In the OOV OOV , the OOV of OOV needs to take a OOV and OOV approach .
OOV , OOV 's OOV OOV OOV may well come back to OOV it , because fisheries are not the only OOV between OOV and the OOV
The EU should not be the OOV in OOV 's OOV OOV , but OOV should it OOV be an OOV OOV OOV OOV .
<P> The next OOV of financial OOV for OOV and OOV OOV is OOV up .
It really is time we OOV OOV about and OOV OOV , however OOV they may be , because aid cannot and should not be a OOV OOV .
We are OOV forward , at last , to taking a OOV look at the OOV on the OOV OOV of the fisheries agreement and OOV the necessary OOV .
Mr OOV OOV this particular point in his report .
We had an OOV OOV an OOV long time OOV and after that OOV was the OOV .
But we must OOV out - it could be the OOV before the OOV , because there is every OOV of a OOV OOV .
<P> But first I should like to thank OOV OOV for his excellent report .
As one of our most OOV OOV OOV in the Committee on OOV , he has yet again done a OOV OOV .
There really is no OOV any need to make a point of OOV just how important an OOV of measures and OOV is , especially in view of the OOV of the OOV fisheries policy .
But just what will the Commission 's OOV OOV OOV OOV ?
The OOV - on this we are clear - must be to OOV the need to improve OOV OOV with the social and economic importance of fisheries , in which case it is OOV for interest OOV to be more involved and , given the OOV OOV now OOV to OOV in the agricultural sector OOV , for example as the result of OOV , it also means OOV a new , OOV way of OOV OOV as a OOV , OOV OOV .
<P> As I am OOV you are all aware , a OOV programme of work OOV us .
I am OOV forward to a OOV and OOV debate in the interest of the future of European fisheries .
In any case , I think we should not OOV in our efforts .
<SPEAKER OOV LANGUAGE="ES " NAME=" OOV OOV " > Mr President , I thank Mr OOV for having come before this House .
OOV is here because , at the OOV of OOV , the Group of the OOV of European OOV OOV OOV to come .
OOV I OOV you , Commissioner , that in OOV OOV , a OOV before the agreement OOV , you said here that you OOV do OOV in your OOV to find a OOV " and that you OOV get your OOV OOV " .
OOV OOV OOV it is the Community OOV that is OOV OOV , but the OOV is up to its OOV .
But I am not one to OOV you .
I believe you have done what it was within your OOV to do , which really was very OOV .
The problem for me is that there has not been a OOV OOV by the various Commission services , and there has not been enough political OOV from the Council , and what is OOV , in my opinion , is that there has been no clear OOV , OOV or OOV work in OOV by the government of the country most OOV .
<P> Mr OOV , I believe Mr OOV s OOV - which I think was very positive - rather than OOV the sector has made it more OOV , OOV because of the OOV in the process when it OOV place .
OOV are the OOV and OOV that the sector OOV at the OOV .
<P> The sector OOV on OOV that it does not want an agreement at just any OOV , and it is OOV that an agreement will be OOV just to OOV OOV .
The sector OOV that what the OOV are OOV - the OOV conditions that they want the Community OOV to OOV to - is OOV , and there are a number of OOV on OOV OOV and OOV OOV that are OOV .
<P> I think the OOV authorities need a clear OOV from the Union .
The Union would like to have OOV cooperation with its OOV , and now we all OOV that we would have OOV a OOV if the OOV Government had OOV in time to Community OOV .
It is OOV that for OOV OOV the OOV Government OOV that it did not want an agreement , and now they are OOV to OOV you , Mr OOV , for the OOV to OOV one and for the negotiations having OOV down .
The result will be that the next OOV - like OOV - or OOV who OOV in OOV will think that what the OOV want is OOV the OOV of what they are OOV or OOV .
<P> This whole OOV process , which has been going on now for OOV OOV , is not having any positive OOV for one OOV reason : because in certain OOV in the Union it is OOV a OOV of the European Union itself .
OOV we OOV OOV on end OOV the Union ' s OOV OOV and good OOV , and then , when we have a subject on our OOV that OOV OOV more than OOV OOV OOV , we OOV not to see what is OOV and not to do what any government would do to OOV up for such an important part of its OOV OOV .
There are some who say that President OOV should have OOV not just fisheries cooperation but the whole OOV OOV programme .
<P> OOV regard to the OOV and OOV reports , which OOV forward many points for debate on the OOV OOV of the OOV , I think that if a number of amendments are OOV we shall be able to achieve two OOV OOV and OOV some OOV .
But a OOV agreement - such as the one we should OOV on the OOV OOV - does not OOV that it is a OOV between various OOV OOV but rather a OOV report OOV the future of the whole sector and the OOV of fishing as an economic OOV OOV the European Union .
The OOV that we OOV OOV can only be OOV through a fisheries policy OOV on OOV OOV and OOV to the market , with the OOV of the political OOV that still OOV .
<P> The OOV process must be OOV , in the words of Mr OOV , OOV I OOV on his work , OOV under difficult conditions .
OOV report OOV many of the problems that we are going to have to OOV during the process of OOV the common fisheries policy .
OOV has OOV many OOV , for OOV the OOV OOV of fishing , the development of the social OOV of the OOV , and the OOV of OOV that OOV regions as OOV .
<P> The OOV report is also OOV in that it OOV to social OOV or OOV OOV with third countries as a OOV part of the OOV
<P> We are OOV clear legal and OOV OOV on OOV OOV .
We believe that the OOV of the OOV should not OOV any OOV OOV whether political or OOV on OOV .
OOV amendments support OOV the current OOV OOV OOV .
<P> OOV , I should like to OOV Mr OOV - and also Mr OOV - for the excellent report on the OOV of OOV and the OOV that certain OOV of it OOV for the Community fisheries sector .
The international OOV of the OOV , our OOV more necessary OOV in OOV organisations , is a OOV that still OOV us .
This question is going to OOV and be OOV many more OOV in this House .
I OOV Mr OOV on his political OOV , which could OOV be OOV OOV .
<SPEAKER OOV NAME=" OOV " > Mr President , Commissioner , I would like to OOV all the OOV on the excellent work that they have done .
I OOV OOV of the issue of regional management of the common fisheries policy .
In fact the OOV OOV management better OOV the OOV of development that we would like to see OOV .
This would OOV much OOV OOV in decision making by all those with a OOV interest in each of the OOV OOV , whether OOV in fishing , OOV OOV , OOV or OOV .
If such a system were already in place we would not be OOV the OOV we OOV at present over the Commission 's proposals for a OOV OOV plan for the OOV OOV .
<P> It is the clear view of those most OOV involved that , as OOV OOV , the plan would have both a OOV OOV on the OOV concerned and an OOV OOV on OOV OOV , and this view is OOV by OOV .
<P> The OOV OOV are most OOV to the Commissioner for meeting us and for his OOV that these proposals are not yet OOV OOV .
A great deal of work has been done OOV , both in OOV and OOV the OOV OOV , on OOV measures in general and on OOV OOV in particular .
I hope that the Commission will take the results of this work very OOV indeed .
In particular , I would ask it to OOV the OOV of OOV OOV OOV OOV OOV and also to OOV the OOV to which the OOV OOV OOV on a OOV OOV .
OOV , OOV of OOV OOV OOV on some OOV OOV OOV OOV of the OOV OOV , I OOV that it will OOV for OOV OOV in areas where the OOV OOV is high .
<SPEAKER OOV NAME=" OOV " > Mr President , Commissioner , it was OOV that the OOV and OOV reports would not only OOV on the OOV but would OOV in OOV on the OOV OOV , and I consider it OOV appropriate that the OOV should OOV to OOV the OOV process in OOV of any OOV OOV with Parliament .
<P> I OOV that the OOV OOV of the OOV , OOV the OOV of OOV OOV , has not been OOV and as a result we have had to OOV OOV OOV OOV in OOV , as OOV by the current OOV OOV .
In OOV , we must OOV the process by which , and the level at which , decisions are made .
OOV amendments OOV with my OOV OOV OOV to OOV certain important OOV for the OOV OOV , including that OOV OOV should OOV since the good OOV for its OOV as a OOV principle OOV OOV .
That in the OOV of OOV with areas like the OOV OOV , OOV OOV areas OOV on OOV OOV should continue in the future .
OOV a system of OOV management should be OOV OOV on the OOV areas and with OOV from fishing , OOV and OOV interests able to OOV OOV , not to OOV the OOV , not to take OOV OOV from the Council or the Commission but to OOV each Member State with OOV in a particular OOV to OOV in OOV and OOV OOV which are OOV , appropriate to these areas and , therefore , more OOV to OOV .
<P> OOV OOV have OOV to even greater OOV of OOV within OOV in the OOV OOV and in the OOV of the OOV itself .
OOV can , for example , the Commission OOV OOV OOV of OOV OOV and even OOV in OOV OOV OOV OOV on the other hand OOV OOV of OOV for human OOV ?
<P> OOV us use the OOV OOV from the OOV of the OOV to achieve a OOV which OOV .
I OOV the Commission and the Council to look OOV at OOV management within a framework of OOV OOV , of course , but so that OOV parties can OOV more fully and so that the new OOV , once agreed , can actually achieve its OOV , OOV the OOV OOV of European fisheries .
<SPEAKER OOV LANGUAGE="ES " NAME=" OOV OOV " > Mr President , the excellent work done by Mr OOV and Mr OOV OOV OOV , but I OOV believe that their OOV - and they are people with OOV OOV and OOV of the sector - has in some OOV OOV them to go OOV the subject of their reports .
The problem is that the amendments OOV this view , and OOV in some OOV they have even come to OOV OOV points .
I hope that in OOV ' s OOV these issues may be OOV OOV , because my group would like to vote for both these reports .
<P> As for the matter of fisheries and OOV , it must be OOV that the OOV level of Community OOV in fisheries OOV has OOV the OOV of trade OOV and more fully than in other OOV .
OOV the OOV of fishing itself , the OOV OOV of fisheries or other OOV may have their own particular OOV , they also have OOV OOV to those of OOV and can have an especially OOV social OOV , with OOV serious OOV on working conditions or the OOV of OOV OOV .
I think the excellent OOV report points out OOV measures for these OOV OOV .
I should also like to OOV Mr OOV .
<P> Finally , on the subject of OOV I want to point out two things : first , the OOV OOV that the OOV of agreement is having and will have in OOV areas of the Community both on the OOV themselves and on OOV OOV OOV .
OOV they are OOV areas , OOV OOV OOV very OOV OOV of OOV .
<P> The second point is that the OOV of the OOV OOV OOV OOV with that of a state OOV with us through an OOV agreement .
In this situation it is to be OOV that the Commission will be able to make the OOV authorities OOV that the OOV can only be OOV on OOV , and that , if necessary , it will be able to OOV OOV measures .
What the OOV is OOV is that if there is agreement , it may even be OOV OOV to the interests of the European Union .
I should like there to be an agreement , and I hope the Commission will be able to OOV its right to OOV .
<SPEAKER OOV OOV " NAME=" OOV OOV OOV > Mr President , Commissioner , I wish to OOV your attention to a point that I believe OOV an OOV in the common fisheries policy .
It is important that this should be OOV in the OOV to be OOV in OOV , since it concerns the situation of fishing in the OOV regions .
It is also important that the common fisheries policy should take account of the OOV made in the Treaty of OOV and OOV the OOV that OOV from their situation .
This OOV particularly to OOV , with its OOV regions , the OOV and OOV , but also to the OOV and OOV OOV regions .
The European Union has an opportunity to OOV up an OOV economic OOV in these particularly OOV regions , and this OOV OOV in this field must be OOV for the future .
<P> OOV regard to OOV , we are OOV for the information that the Commissioner has just given us , although for the OOV this is OOV OOV .
The situation in OOV is that OOV OOV have OOV OOV since OOV OOV and if the agreement is OOV one OOV , many of these OOV may by then have become OOV .
I therefore support the OOV made by OOV OOV and OOV OOV OOV to the OOV that both the Council and the Commission must OOV to OOV a more OOV approach in their OOV with the OOV Government .
<P> In general terms , we have OOV an OOV of OOV OOV towards the OOV of the common fisheries policy in OOV .
It is OOV OOV that the view from OOV is OOV OOV , because OOV fishing should be a OOV of employment , the OOV OOV is that the common fisheries policy has been a OOV of OOV .
We hope that OOV the OOV , which was OOV on this year , is a first positive OOV for the future .
We are particularly OOV in the fact that attention has been OOV to the OOV of OOV that has OOV from OOV OOV in recent years , and the fact that the problem of OOV and development has been given OOV OOV .
OOV , as Mr OOV has OOV out , we would like to see an OOV OOV of OOV OOV for OOV fishing .
<SPEAKER OOV LANGUAGE="ES " NAME=" OOV OOV " > Mr President , I still have my OOV as to the OOV used , especially in Mr OOV ' s report , and I still believe that the OOV of the fisheries sector OOV at the regional OOV OOV a more OOV OOV .
In OOV , Mr OOV and Mr OOV have OOV OOV in many OOV OOV to the measures that the OOV should OOV .
We cannot OOV to OOV the OOV that has been made a OOV to OOV to OOV OOV , but the European OOV ' s OOV OOV that in some OOV areas there are still some clear OOV .
<P> We have therefore OOV a OOV of amendments OOV all to OOV to OOV the OOV that Parliament does not have a OOV OOV towards the future of the OOV , because that is not the case .
It may be that we do not agree on specific measures , but if something OOV out of these reports it is that Parliament is in OOV agreement with the fisheries sector in that the OOV OOV some OOV OOV .
I therefore ask for our amendments to be OOV , because far from OOV yet again into OOV OOV they OOV this OOV for change and the need for OOV OOV about the fisheries policy , with our OOV set on the future and not the OOV .
<P> If there were no clear need for this , the Council of OOV last OOV would have given some OOV that this were the case .
OOV cannot go on like this .
The OOV OOV that have OOV the OOV since the OOV have to be OOV for by the industry at the end of every year with a OOV of OOV OOV OOV to its OOV .
OOV you come to the OOV that have been OOV this year , you have to OOV what economic sector could OOV with these rules of OOV .
If OOV OOV are OOV OOV and OOV , it is because a OOV of OOV in the policy that OOV fishing not only OOV it to OOV but actually OOV it .
A sector OOV by a OOV of OOV , OOV and often OOV rules can only have very OOV responsibility in this state of things , and yet it OOV has to OOV the OOV .
<P> The OOV is in need of very OOV OOV that will provide OOV for a fishing industry which , OOV the rules which OOV it and even OOV them , has OOV to OOV and has done OOV it can to OOV and continue to provide OOV regions with OOV and OOV .
That is why I must again OOV that , when there is OOV OOV with the resources policy , the OOV results of which we have just OOV yet again at OOV ' s Council meeting , with a OOV system that OOV OOV , when issues such as OOV OOV and OOV of OOV have yet to be OOV , not to OOV the matter of OOV the only Community policy that still OOV on OOV of OOV into OOV with the OOV , the Commission cannot OOV OOV a OOV OOV OOV like the one it has OOV up .
If the Commission really OOV that the future of European fisheries OOV not on the OOV OOV of a OOV , but on the proposal of measures already OOV in current OOV , if the Commission ' s great proposal and great OOV for the future OOV is to be OOV OOV and the OOV of OOV , OOV the OOV has come , Mr President , to ask in all OOV for it to make OOV for other people who can OOV in new OOV and the OOV OOV of responsibility .
<SPEAKER OOV OOV " NAME=" OOV " > Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , I should like , very OOV and OOV , to make three OOV on the OOV OOV of the common fisheries policy .
<P> OOV first point concerns OOV to OOV and to OOV resources .
OOV the OOV OOV of every fishing OOV should be one of the European Union ' s main concerns .
I therefore feel that it is OOV to at least OOV OOV OOV to OOV OOV OOV " , particularly given that OOV OOV OOV fishing have a OOV OOV on the OOV resources of every Member State .
<P> OOV second point OOV to the principle of OOV OOV and the full use of fishing rights OOV OOV Community OOV .
The principle of OOV OOV is a OOV OOV of the common fisheries policy .
However , the OOV of this principle to fishing OOV OOV by the European Union through financial OOV , OOV in OOV with third countries or in OOV OOV by regional fishing organisations , may OOV to OOV OOV .
For example , the Community is not taking full OOV of the OOV that it OOV with such OOV in the OOV of some third countries , even OOV there are Member States OOV to use them .
OOV , although the OOV OOV " with OOV countries " OOV down that once Member States have made use of their OOV fishing rights , the OOV part should be made available to all OOV Member States , this OOV is not OOV under the OOV OOV " with OOV countries " .
<P> The European Union is not making full use of the fishing OOV for the open OOV that it has OOV through regional fishing organisations , even OOV there are Member States that are OOV to take over the OOV that are not OOV by the OOV OOV " , as they are OOV .
They are OOV OOV themselves to the OOV that their OOV will be OOV once a OOV of OOV OOV to the parties involved OOV place .
<P> OOV third point OOV to the role of the European Union on the international OOV .
OOV the Union as a whole is a OOV fishing OOV and one of the OOV OOV for OOV OOV , it must OOV and OOV a role that OOV its importance in international organisations and OOV in regional fishing organisations .
I am very OOV for the Commissioner ' s OOV and I OOV OOV to use the OOV of all OOV Member States in negotiations with OOV and not OOV to OOV the case for OOV and OOV .
<SPEAKER OOV OOV " > Mr President , the common fisheries policy , as many have OOV out , has OOV to OOV OOV OOV at OOV OOV to support a OOV industry .
This is OOV , at least in part , to the OOV OOV of some of the OOV of the OOV as OOV down in OOV OOV .
<P> It is OOV to OOV OOV both the market and industry OOV OOV resources .
OOV the OOV is OOV next year it is OOV that the OOV of OOV OOV and the OOV of the OOV OOV be made its OOV and OOV OOV , and the only way to do this is to OOV a OOV and OOV OOV approach to fisheries management .
The OOV approach should OOV that before any OOV can be OOV on a OOV basis there must be , at the very least , a OOV OOV of the OOV and a OOV OOV OOV OOV .
<P> In other words , the current OOV of certain OOV , certain OOV OOV by some EU countries would not be OOV to OOV .
It means that any new fishing OOV or any OOV OOV of OOV OOV must be OOV for its OOV OOV on the OOV OOV as well as any OOV OOV as OOV or any OOV on the OOV OOV .
It means being OOV when one OOV the level at which one OOV to OOV a OOV OOV .
The use of OOV OOV OOV or any of a number of other OOV points is quite OOV OOV , for they OOV to OOV and OOV OOV .
<P> OOV and OOV OOV points must be OOV which will OOV the OOV OOV at a high enough level that the OOV of OOV OOV or OOV is OOV .
The best OOV to OOV of the OOV approach is the one OOV in the OOV OOV OOV agreement , and many of these and other OOV are OOV there .
The EU has OOV these OOV for some OOV and I think it is high time that it OOV them for its own OOV .
<P> A number of things have been said already about OOV and I just want to say that we would OOV that it is OOV up to OOV , as a OOV state with OOV over its OOV and its OOV economic OOV , to OOV what it OOV to do with these resources .
We are therefore OOV to any OOV of political or economic OOV being OOV to OOV on OOV in order to OOV it or to OOV it to OOV an agreement with the European Union .
OOV , we are OOV that no OOV agreement with OOV should OOV any OOV to OOV of OOV OOV .
We do not OOV OOV OOV there and so OOV has no right OOV to OOV OOV to EU OOV there , OOV for that matter has the EU any right to OOV into such negotiations with OOV or to OOV EU OOV OOV to go there as has OOV in the OOV .
<SPEAKER OOV OOV " NAME=" OOV " > Mr President , the OOV importance of the fishing industry is well OOV , not only for the OOV that it OOV OOV and OOV , but also for the economic development of many fishing regions and OOV , including the small OOV fishing sector that OOV the European Union ' s OOV of OOV OOV and the OOV of its OOV and OOV .
OOV , as has been OOV at regional OOV , there is OOV OOV of the common fisheries policy , both with regard to the OOV system and OOV and with regard to the system of OOV OOV OOV , which have OOV to OOV and have not OOV any major OOV to the industry .
This OOV it OOV that Member States which have OOV their OOV should not be OOV through further OOV of their fishing OOV OOV other countries have not OOV the OOV OOV down in OOV OOV .
<P> It has also become clear that most of those working in the fishing industry OOV OOV about OOV OOV on the management and OOV of OOV OOV , although they do not question the need to OOV OOV .
What is OOV , therefore , is a OOV OOV of the common fisheries policy , OOV OOV and other OOV parties in the OOV process , to ensure that their OOV and OOV can OOV to the OOV of a more OOV and OOV system .
We need appropriate OOV measures to OOV the OOV of OOV OOV on fishing and OOV measures that improve the OOV of OOV of OOV , who must not OOV as a result of possible measures to OOV OOV , as has OOV to the OOV OOV in the OOV of OOV .
<P> We must also take account of the specific OOV of the OOV regions and it is particularly important , as the OOV report OOV , that we OOV towards OOV the OOV OOV to OOV OOV , which is , in fact , something on which Parliament has already taken a decision .
OOV regard to current negotiations in the OOV OOV OOV , it must be OOV , as it is in the OOV OOV report , that Community fishing OOV cannot be OOV from a OOV economic OOV OOV on trade in OOV .
OOV in the European Union is OOV in OOV ; it OOV towards the OOV of the social and economic OOV of OOV areas , OOV a way of life and a OOV for OOV in OOV areas OOV our OOV , OOV at the same time OOV OOV OOV .
<P> I also wish , Mr President , to OOV international fishing OOV , which have a OOV role in OOV the European market by means of the European fishing OOV .
What is of particular concern , however , is the information that we have OOV not only on the OOV in the fishing OOV with OOV , but also on the OOV in OOV the fishing agreement with OOV .
We need more than just a OOV OOV .
What we need is the OOV of measures that will OOV the OOV of OOV and the rights of OOV who are OOV up in this situation , as is OOV OOV in OOV .
<SPEAKER OOV OOV " OOV OOV " > Mr President , OOV is the year in which the Commission is to OOV a new common fisheries policy .
In my view , it is of OOV importance that the Commission should OOV OOV the fisheries industry itself in the OOV OOV OOV up to its decisions .
OOV OOV OOV results into OOV OOV , the Commission should not only take the OOV of OOV , but also the OOV .
If not , OOV OOV OOV OOV and OOV will OOV with OOV OOV from them .
OOV , especially in the OOV , OOV the OOV of OOV OOV , OOV there is a good reason for them .
A OOV example is the recent OOV OOV OOV on OOV OOV for OOV and OOV , which will set them back EUR OOV million .
This is a OOV which , OOV to the European OOV Council , is OOV in order to OOV OOV , OOV OOV OOV that such OOV were OOV made and that this was a political decision .
<P> European OOV are OOV in very different OOV .
This OOV a regional approach which is OOV in OOV with the European Union ' s principle of OOV .
That means that in the case of the OOV , it will OOV the policy for the OOV OOV in OOV with other OOV OOV countries .
These countries will OOV whether the OOV system of the OOV OOV can OOV OOV from other regions .
If the Union OOV on other OOV having OOV to the OOV OOV , the OOV of as yet OOV OOV OOV would be a real way of OOV OOV OOV of OOV OOV within OOV .
<P> Finally , I would OOV rapporteur OOV in his OOV for a OOV OOV of fisheries OOV which the Commission OOV with third countries .
OOV all Member States OOV OOV from OOV Community OOV in this way ?
I OOV it very much .
<SPEAKER OOV NAME=" OOV " > Mr President , when we OOV the excellent reports by my OOV Mr OOV , Mr OOV , Mr OOV and Mr OOV , it is against a OOV of OOV in the EU fisheries sector .
As we OOV the OOV OOV of the OOV , which are clearly necessary and long OOV and which are OOV in these reports , we do so in the OOV that OOV OOV are in OOV OOV .
OOV many OOV are OOV too few OOV .
As a result , EU fishing OOV are OOV and many OOV of OOV are being OOV at OOV and on OOV .
<P> The situation in the OOV OOV is of particular concern .
OOV OOV in the OOV OOV OOV and OOV were OOV in OOV by the Council .
OOV the Commission is OOV to OOV OOV OOV measures to aid the OOV of OOV OOV , which have OOV to OOV OOV in that sector .
<P> I am extremely OOV , like my OOV , the other OOV OOV , to Commissioner OOV for OOV to OOV us OOV this OOV to OOV these OOV OOV measures .
We welcome Mr OOV 's OOV OOV to OOV with OOV of the industry to OOV OOV to the OOV proposals which have been OOV OOV by the OOV OOV in the last few OOV .
<P> A OOV , OOV OOV OOV plan OOV OOV OOV OOV measures , the OOV of OOV OOV OOV and the OOV of the OOV new fishing OOV will OOV be more OOV than the OOV of a plan which would OOV OOV fishing to continue in OOV OOV OOV and which would OOV OOV to the OOV of OOV the OOV OOV .
<P> The OOV and OOV reports have OOV some amendments , which OOV to do OOV with the OOV OOV OOV and OOV open the OOV OOV and OOV OOV OOV to the OOV OOV .
OOV there are some Member States that still regard the resources of the OOV OOV as a OOV OOV .
I hope that this debate may OOV them to their OOV .
<SPEAKER OOV LANGUAGE="DE " NAME=" OOV " > Mr President , how should and how will the European Union 's common fisheries policy look after OOV ?
This question has OOV the OOV of OOV involved in fisheries for some time now .
The OOV and OOV reports are important OOV in the OOV debate .
The OOV debate on OOV will , however , not start OOV the Commission 's OOV OOV has been OOV within the next few OOV although , quite OOV , OOV of OOV OOV fisheries interests in the European Union are already OOV to OOV the OOV process within the Commission .
<P> A great many OOV have been made on the Commission .
I think it is still too OOV for the European Parliament to OOV itself one way or another .
We should OOV OOV , within the framework of these two reports , to OOV the problems and OOV various possible OOV .
<P> OOV OOV have done a great deal of work and have OOV the OOV problems of the common fisheries policy and I am OOV to them for that .
<P> I should like to OOV out just three of these OOV problems .
OOV , the problem of OOV to OOV , which should at least be OOV as part of the OOV .
OOV OOV must be OOV on the basis of OOV OOV and the OOV OOV must be OOV from their results .
<P> OOV : OOV is another OOV which OOV OOV OOV to OOV debate .
But OOV does not OOV some form of OOV .
We have a common fisheries policy in the EU and that is how it is going to OOV .
<P> OOV : I should like to OOV by again OOV how important it is for the whole fisheries sector - OOV , OOV , industry and so on - to be involved in the OOV OOV process .
This is the only way we shall be able to ensure that the new common fisheries policy is well OOV by those OOV it OOV .
<SPEAKER OOV LANGUAGE="FR" NAME=" OOV > Mr President , European Union fisheries policy is a OOV subject .
I would like to OOV it from the point of view of OOV and in OOV to the specific problem of OOV .
<P> As far as the Group of the OOV is concerned , I would OOV you that we are in favour of a fisheries policy that OOV the OOV OOV , in favour of OOV OOV and OOV fishing , which OOV OOV , and in favour of OOV fishing , which OOV account of available OOV .
This is a question of OOV economic OOV to OOV OOV as well as OOV social OOV .
<P> We are against OOV OOV that OOV OOV OOV fishing , which OOV OOV OOV , to the point of OOV out OOV and OOV OOV safety and OOV , a fisheries policy which OOV OOV to OOV out of all OOV , and so OOV .
OOV of this , we consider that OOV market OOV OOV one of the OOV OOV to such OOV and that these issues should be taken into OOV in the next OOV of OOV trade negotiations on OOV .
<P> We therefore OOV that the Commission present appropriate proposals , both on the issue of the future OOV of the OOV OOV and on social OOV to the other OOV of the OOV .
OOV , we are , OOV , not particularly in favour of the OOV fishing OOV between the European Union and third countries , often small countries , OOV OOV OOV are OOV no OOV than the OOV OOV them .
<P> It is OOV that we OOV as OOV as possible .
However , we OOV that a OOV of EUR OOV million was OOV to OOV , given that it is OOV to an action programme which will support the local fishing industry , infrastructure and OOV and that a OOV report on how these funds are being used will be OOV to Parliament .
<SPEAKER OOV OOV " NAME=" OOV > Mr President , Commissioner , I would like to start by OOV Mr OOV on his OOV report , which was OOV by the OOV committee , and Mr OOV , who has also done an excellent OOV .
However , it cannot be OOV that , as has already been mentioned , the points and issues we are OOV today are the same as those OOV with by the OOV and OOV reports .
<P> I will not go back over the OOV OOV why these issues are OOV : the OOV OOV OOV , OOV areas , OOV the principle of OOV OOV , OOV which can OOV be OOV as OOV .
I , too , see the OOV of these issues as very specific and OOV the view OOV by my OOV Members that they are OOV .
OOV regard to this , I OOV that , for the very reason that we are going through a OOV of OOV - and if we are OOV out OOV then it is because our current OOV is not working or the OOV of OOV would not OOV - we must be very aware that we cannot OOV OOV as it is , OOV , OOV , can we continue to be OOV in our OOV .
In this regard , the Group of the European OOV ' s OOV has OOV amendments OOV OOV at OOV greater OOV between the OOV .
<P> I would , however , make one OOV to the Commissioner and to all of us : it is important that a OOV is OOV , for a major political reason OOV from OOV OOV .
At the last OOV in OOV , we all - Commission and Parliament - OOV OOV because the countries ' OOV to OOV their own national interests OOV OOV once again and we OOV that Council for OOV the Community OOV in OOV .
OOV we must work to ensure that a common policy is OOV OOV in this OOV sector , but in order to do so we must OOV to those who are OOV - OOV the OOV - that there is OOV OOV or OOV for the OOV made , therefore that there is no cooperation in the OOV process .
<P> If we do this , we will be able to OOV - and I am OOV that we are OOV of OOV so - that it is possible to achieve a OOV common policy , OOV OOV rather than OOV them and OOV the OOV of all the Member States , particularly the fisheries OOV in all their OOV .
<SPEAKER OOV NAME=" OOV " > Mr President , it is always OOV to see the same few OOV at every fishing debate and I would like to OOV the Commissioner and OOV and OOV that we may be small in OOV but we all have an OOV interest in fishing and no matter how OOV the debate is , OOV OOV we will be there .
<P> The OOV of the OOV and the OOV OOV of the OOV OOV OOV a OOV time for the fishing industry .
On the one hand all of us here in this OOV want to see the OOV of the fishing industry , not least because we OOV OOV the OOV ; but on the other hand we are OOV with OOV OOV OOV of OOV OOV OOV , so much so that certain OOV may no OOV OOV in the future .
<P> In OOV , as mentioned this OOV by many of my OOV OOV , the issue of OOV is OOV the OOV OOV .
OOV say that even before the OOV of the OOV OOV there could be OOV OOV of the OOV OOV because of OOV in OOV , OOV and the OOV OOV OOV proposals .
OOV say that in order to have a fishing industry at all we need to OOV , they OOV back to the OOV OOV in OOV OOV of the OOV of OOV OOV .
I really do not know how you OOV the OOV , but by the end of OOV we must .
<P> OOV OOV to people in the industry , those involved in OOV OOV and those involved in OOV , it OOV there is a OOV to be involved and a need for greater OOV of all those concerned .
In OOV , the OOV OOV 's OOV and the OOV have OOV OOV and OOV a better way of working .
The proposal for OOV management and greater OOV of the OOV is a serious one that has the support of fishing and OOV OOV OOV .
In other countries there are also OOV .
This can only be good for debate .
<P> In OOV , this year and next will provide an opportunity to get the OOV right .
I look forward to OOV this on future OOV in OOV .
<SPEAKER OOV OOV " NAME=" OOV OOV " > Mr President , Commissioner OOV , President OOV was OOV by the OOV of OOV and at the same time OOV a cooperation agreement with that country , which OOV fishing .
The European OOV in the OOV OOV has not taken to OOV for a year now and OOV of workers are OOV .
The Commission is not OOV up to its OOV and is OOV to OOV a OOV and OOV agreement that can only OOV to the OOV of our OOV in two or three years ' time .
<P> OOV adopted in this Parliament are OOV , as is Parliament itself , and the Member States , OOV in particular , OOV a OOV OOV .
This is the OOV OOV that OOV , OOV and the OOV OOV in OOV , OOV , the OOV and OOV have today of the European Union .
I am OOV to have to say this , Commissioner OOV , but things could not have been OOV more OOV .
<SPEAKER OOV OOV " NAME=" OOV " > Mr President , first of all , I should like to OOV both OOV , Mr OOV and Mr OOV , on the way in which they have set the OOV for the new OOV OOV , for it OOV like this debate OOV part of the OOV for this OOV , and we could say that we are OOV these reports for our own OOV in an appropriate OOV in order to OOV a position on this .
<P> If we consider the fisheries policy , then there is actually one OOV which needs to change on a number of OOV , and with regard to that debate I should like to put forward a few OOV points , which are also OOV on the situation in my region , so as to give you an OOV of the OOV we have from the OOV OOV .
OOV OOV with , there is the issue of OOV , especially OOV OOV , within the OOV
This will need to be OOV more OOV in future , for any policy OOV on OOV , and if we want to OOV a policy in a OOV OOV OOV , OOV OOV is OOV .
This is also the OOV point , and in OOV course , we will need to consider OOV in this field in the OOV that countries do not have OOV systems for OOV OOV .
<P> The second important point for the future policy is a OOV programme which needs to be OOV to OOV the present OOV OOV programme .
European OOV should OOV OOV OOV OOV first and OOV , as well as environmental and quality OOV with the following action points : a OOV OOV in all EU countries - in my own country this OOV has OOV OOV , which was also OOV from the fisheries OOV OOV in OOV a OOV of OOV OOV .
A second point is a OOV OOV for the use of OOV , which OOV OOV OOV .
This is a OOV OOV OOV .
The third point is the OOV set OOV OOV for regions which are OOV OOV by the OOV OOV OOV .
I am , for example , OOV of regions in Europe which OOV OOV on OOV OOV and the OOV OOV .
Europe should OOV OOV in this .
<P> A OOV point , in my opinion , is the OOV of the fisheries policy which must be further OOV .
<P> A OOV point is the OOV OOV in OOV safety , because the OOV issue will OOV be OOV the fisheries industry , and we must be able to deal with this OOV .
<P> A OOV point is that , in the OOV of the environmental problems in OOV countries upon EU enlargement , we will need to OOV particular attention to the problems which OOV there in the field of OOV safety .
<SPEAKER OOV LANGUAGE="ES " NAME=" OOV OOV " > Mr President , we are OOV with the OOV OOV of the Commission and the Council to OOV on behalf of the citizens .
The OOV OOV OOV OOV OOV is OOV , OOV as a OOV OOV of this OOV to OOV .
<P> In the agreement with OOV they have had no OOV OOV .
OOV the OOV Presidency OOV us at the time that it was OOV to OOV an agreement .
We are going to have a major social problem on our OOV , and we have no real OOV .
OOV some of our fishing OOV are going to OOV their OOV OOV OOV and OOV to the OOV that OOV OOV and OOV and we OOV OOV .
<P> OOV OOV OOV of OOV with the resources of some fishing OOV that OOV to the OOV people , the Commission OOV by OOV Community OOV as real OOV , OOV their OOV and OOV to OOV that that is the way to go , without OOV an OOV .
OOV OOV be OOV today that all the Community OOV that have had OOV to do with fishing in OOV are OOV up ?
OOV , then , OOV Union relations must be OOV OOV .
OOV the funds OOV into this agreement should be used to OOV OOV in the areas OOV .
<P> OOV , the Commission Presidency is OOV to OOV a very OOV problem at the last OOV .
We are concerned that the OOV OOV is just a OOV OOV for the OOV of the OOV and not a real OOV to the problem .
<SPEAKER OOV OOV " NAME=" OOV > Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , OOV is a OOV OOV which will OOV OOV and will OOV OOV change to all OOV of the OOV .
I fully agree with Mr OOV when he OOV OOV as a OOV OOV OOV OOV OOV to specific OOV .
OOV , for many , it is a OOV which OOV OOV and OOV , for OOV , those who have OOV in OOV to change or are OOV to do so , it is a OOV of problems and OOV .
<P> OOV to a OOV OOV has had OOV OOV on the fisheries sector .
In fact , in OOV such as that of OOV or OOV , some of the OOV OOV OOV , which have OOV up and OOV in a local OOV OOV far , feel OOV by the OOV of OOV .
The work of such OOV is OOV the OOV of local OOV .
<P> OOV , when we OOV of negotiations OOV within the OOV OOV OOV on the OOV of trade , we must take into account the different specific OOV in order to OOV OOV about OOV OOV of OOV OOV which could OOV to OOV OOV and the OOV of the OOV sector .
We must , therefore , OOV a OOV policy OOV on OOV trade , taking into account the fact that , in many countries , OOV from Europe are subject to OOV OOV which OOV the OOV OOV of the OOV market .
<P> OOV , we must OOV the fishing of certain OOV OOV which , in Europe , are subject to OOV OOV but which , in other countries , can be OOV and then OOV on the Community market .
<P> It would also be appropriate to OOV the system of OOV trade OOV , for OOV the level of development of third countries no OOV OOV the OOV of these OOV .
<P> Finally , we must OOV the European Union policy which OOV OOV to the Community market for OOV OOV from third countries OOV upon OOV for the European OOV to the fishing OOV of the countries with which we are OOV .
<SPEAKER OOV LANGUAGE="DE " NAME=" OOV " > Mr President , OOV Members , on behalf of the Commission , I should first like to thank all the OOV , the Committee on OOV and the other OOV involved for their OOV work in the OOV up to today 's debate .
I should also like to OOV OOV OOV to the OOV of the Committee on OOV , Mr OOV , for OOV all the work and for his OOV OOV report .
<P> Mr OOV , you make it quite OOV in your report that it is OOV to OOV the future of the common fisheries policy without taking account of the OOV OOV OOV fisheries .
OOV every other economic OOV , fisheries are OOV by OOV .
I fully OOV much of what you say in your report and in the resolution OOV to it .
You OOV the fact that European fishing is OOV to the principle of OOV , OOV OOV . the principle of a OOV fisheries OOV which OOV OOV OOV and OOV the OOV environment and OOV an important contribution to the economic and social OOV of OOV areas OOV in fishing .
<P> I particularly welcome your support in the OOV against OOV and OOV fishing .
We shall have an opportunity to OOV Community OOV to this OOV issue .
But I can already see that you , too , are in favour of a more OOV approach here .
<P> I think that we need further OOV on three points in the report .
OOV , the report OOV a certain OOV towards more OOV from international OOV on the OOV that fisheries provide a great many OOV in certain OOV areas .
That is certainly OOV , but if we OOV OOV that OOV must be OOV OOV with the help of the fisheries policy , without taking OOV local conditions in a OOV area into account , then we OOV the OOV , under certain OOV , of OOV in the OOV OOV .
That would be OOV , both for OOV OOV and for OOV .
<P> OOV needs to OOV on their own two OOV .
This may OOV , in OOV OOV , to a OOV in the OOV OOV , but when regions are OOV by such OOV OOV , then the Community must , of course , help .
The most OOV form of help we can provide is by OOV young people a future and OOV them OOV employment to fishing .
<P> OOV , I should like to OOV on the OOV negotiations which you OOV .
As you are aware , we do not yet know if a new OOV OOV will even start and , if so , to what OOV .
But even if there is a OOV OOV , I very much OOV that the Community would be OOV to OOV OOV in fisheries on the OOV at issue , such as OOV or the right of OOV .
OOV now , only OOV or OOV of an EU Member State have been OOV to OOV in the fisheries sector .
<P> OOV and OOV , I should like to OOV you that it has been OOV since the OOV of the common fisheries policy that the Community has one OOV and one vote .
This OOV OOV OOV is more than OOV by the OOV of having a greater say in the OOV of international fisheries policy .
OOV OOV , Mr OOV , your report OOV an important contribution to the OOV debate on the future of the common fisheries policy .
The Commission will certainly take your OOV into OOV OOV in its OOV OOV OOV .
<P> That OOV me to the reports and OOV for OOV from Mr OOV and Mr OOV .
OOV reports start from the same OOV .
The fisheries sector in the Community is under OOV OOV from OOV OOV .
OOV OOV are OOV , there is OOV OOV in the OOV and it is OOV more and more difficult to OOV third country OOV .
I am OOV that you OOV OOV to the OOV in the Commission report on the OOV of the system for fisheries in OOV
It is OOV that some progress was made - I need only OOV the OOV in OOV OOV management or the new OOV in the OOV OOV for OOV OOV or the OOV on OOV measures or the OOV of the OOV - but we still have to OOV that we have OOV to OOV the OOV OOV in OOV important OOV , such as OOV or OOV .
OOV OOV also OOV the following serious OOV , as OOV in the Commission report : OOV OOV has OOV not OOV or has been OOV , the OOV on OOV measures in the Mediterranean has been OOV OOV , the OOV OOV is not OOV OOV enough and OOV OOV have not been made OOV , as we OOV in OOV .
<P> OOV with various OOV of the fisheries sector have also OOV that we need OOV to improve or to OOV OOV OOV of the fisheries policy if we are to achieve responsible , OOV fisheries .
OOV of opinion OOV , the OOV of those OOV are agreed that we need to do more .
In particular , we need OOV OOV , we need better OOV of the rules , we need to OOV OOV , we need to OOV OOV OOV and we need to OOV those OOV , especially the OOV themselves , at an OOV OOV and more OOV when taking decisions on fisheries policy .
<P> The Commission therefore OOV to the OOV for OOV on OOV points .
However , it has the OOV , as OOV the OOV question of the OOV OOV , that the OOV of those OOV are in favour of OOV the OOV OOV .
<P> The Commission will OOV its OOV OOV in a few OOV ' time , together with the reports under OOV OOV OOV OOV of OOV OOV .
We must use the OOV debate to OOV how to OOV the OOV OOV in the reports and OOV OOV for OOV so in order to put the fisheries sector in the Community back on a OOV basis .
<P> On the OOV of the OOV for OOV , the main OOV of the OOV process OOV by all three OOV are as OOV : to OOV OOV OOV and improve OOV with environmental policy measures in order to OOV and OOV OOV ; to ensure that the people OOV OOV are more OOV involved in decision making and to OOV local or OOV problems more OOV in order to ensure that the rules are OOV to and OOV and fisheries management is OOV OOV - in other words , OOV which OOV as good OOV .
OOV , to OOV a fisheries sector which is both OOV and OOV OOV and OOV OOV - OOV at the same time OOV those who are OOV to look OOV for work ; to OOV a OOV OOV fisheries policy which is OOV OOV with other Community OOV in order to achieve responsible and OOV use of resources , and , most OOV , to OOV the Mediterranean OOV .
<P> This OOV me to Mr OOV 's report on OOV .
This resolution will OOV the OOV of the Community OOV in question , OOV at the same time OOV the local sector .
I am OOV that the rapporteur OOV our proposal .
The OOV of EUR OOV million now OOV will be used OOV to OOV the OOV OOV which OOV serious OOV during the OOV conflict in OOV .
This will help the Community OOV to make better use of the agreement .
<P> In OOV , we want to support the following OOV : OOV of the infrastructure , OOV on and OOV of the OOV and new OOV programmes .
I should like to make a few OOV here on the terms of OOV : a OOV of OOV % of the OOV OOV will be OOV out first , as OOV as the government has OOV an action programme .
The OOV , in other words the second OOV , will be OOV out once OOV has OOV a OOV report on the implementation of OOV OOV under the action programme and the use of the funds OOV for them .
<P> Finally , a OOV OOV on the OOV amendments .
OOV OOV OOV OOV , OOV and OOV OOV the OOV for OOV the OOV OOV to OOV .
I think this OOV OOV is both OOV and OOV and the Commission can therefore support it .
We fully OOV the concern OOV in OOV OOV No OOV but , as we already OOV the OOV OOV of all financial and OOV OOV under the terms of our OOV OOV , OOV OOV No OOV is in fact OOV .
<P> As far as the OOV to the debate on the current state of negotiations with OOV are concerned , I should like to thank Parliament for its OOV OOV in the Commission 's work .
I have to OOV you that the agreement OOV OOV OOV to OOV OOV OOV OOV , and that the OOV OOV was , OOV , not OOV to OOV into serious OOV on a new agreement OOV the end of OOV last year , in other words , just three and a OOV OOV OOV .
We did , however , make good use of the time up to OOV , with one OOV OOV a OOV in OOV OOV or OOV .
OOV were OOV OOV every OOV in OOV between OOV OOV and OOV OOV .
We really have done our OOV here .
For the OOV , it is OOV to say that we have OOV no support from the Council .
OOV the main countries OOV and the presidency have OOV us in our efforts and I think that , at the end of the OOV , the meeting between the OOV of OOV and our Commission President was a OOV one .
I hope that negotiations will again get OOV under way , and that OOV we shall OOV be on the OOV OOV .
<SPEAKER OOV NAME=" President " > OOV you , Commissioner .
<P> The OOV debate is OOV .
<P> The vote will take place OOV at OOV OOV .
OOV OOV OOV <SPEAKER OOV NAME=" President " > The next OOV is the OOV debate on : <P> the report ( OOV ) by Mr OOV OOV OOV , on behalf of the Committee on OOV and OOV , on the proposal for a Council decision OOV the OOV of the OOV OOV between the European Community and the OOV ' s OOV of OOV OOV - OOV ) OOV - OOV - OOV ; <P> the OOV question ( OOV ) by Mr OOV , on behalf of the Committee on OOV and OOV , to the Commission , on OOV .
<SPEAKER OOV OOV " OOV OOV OOV " > Mr President , OOV is OOV and OOV at the same time .
OOV in human resources , OOV in OOV means .
It is one of the world ' s OOV and most OOV OOV countries .
It is OOV OOV by OOV OOV .
This is why it is important for Europe to give as much aid as possible .
<P> The agreement with the European Union OOV OOV to good relations and OOV an excellent OOV to OOV up development cooperation and trade .
In OOV , the agreement OOV the OOV to the political OOV which OOV for human rights , good OOV and OOV OOV .
<P> On my recent OOV to OOV with Mr OOV , I OOV that they OOV far greater importance to relations with Europe than we often OOV .
The government as well as the OOV , but also OOV , OOV , industry and OOV organisations look up to Europe and OOV a great deal from us , more than OOV , for OOV .
We should not OOV them in this OOV , and make every OOV to OOV positive OOV .
<P> The following recent OOV can be OOV as OOV : economic OOV by more than OOV % , a OOV in the OOV increase , OOV OOV and greater OOV of women in the political and social OOV .
This is in OOV to the fact that the country OOV under the OOV of an increase in OOV OOV against women , but also in OOV on the OOV and in political OOV .
OOV women OOV for more than OOV % of the OOV in a OOV we OOV .
OOV OOV is still OOV , OOV the recent progress made and OOV OOV by the government and industry .
<P> OOV political OOV OOV OOV life in OOV to a OOV .
OOV OOV is only possible if the government OOV more OOV social conditions .
<P> There is also OOV OOV OOV .
There is a OOV OOV OOV between the two major parties , OOV the fact that you can OOV OOV them OOV in terms of OOV .
The OOV must OOV its OOV role .
OOV OOV cooperation between the OOV parties , the country cannot come out of its political and economic OOV .
It is therefore OOV for the OOV OOV to be OOV OOV .
The European Union should not OOV to OOV OOV , including OOV of this Parliament .
<P> In OOV to OOV and OOV of the OOV OOV , the OOV is also OOV on a OOV OOV from the OOV of OOV OOV .
In principle , the European Union can provide OOV aid to help OOV all of these problems .
OOV of the government OOV should take OOV OOV in aid OOV .
The state is OOV OOV in very many OOV , especially in the OOV and education OOV .
<P> It is OOV that with regard to aid , the European Commission does not have the OOV OOV OOV OOV which it should really have .
OOV , funds only become available after long OOV , it at all .
The OOV is not OOV involved in OOV the programme .
The OOV of OOV OOV to a OOV of OOV in OOV .
In OOV , this is a good , OOV example which OOV the need for OOV in the management sector .
<P> In order to provide OOV aid , it is OOV for the European Commission , the EU Member States and other OOV to OOV their OOV .
The many OOV organisations which are present OOV a OOV role in the implementation of programmes .
The resources are OOV OOV , which OOV OOV and OOV European OOV .
But the OOV OOV the OOV .
<P> OOV OOV OOV us that the OOV OOV peace agreement is being OOV to the OOV .
OOV our OOV to the OOV , we OOV a different OOV , if the OOV be OOV .
OOV the OOV Commission OOV the OOV Council were OOV .
The military OOV has not OOV up .
<P> European aid can only be given to this region if OOV progress is made when the peace agreement is being OOV , which , OOV is not yet the case .
<P> The development of OOV OOV on the good OOV of the country ' s own OOV .
Europe cannot OOV OOV but aid .
OOV OOV is that the country should not be as OOV as it is now .
OOV not .
If only the country ' s resources were better OOV .
<SPEAKER OOV OOV " NAME=" OOV " > Mr President , in OOV fact , OOV it to say that I OOV with Mr OOV OOV OOV , and I would like to take the opportunity to OOV how OOV Parliament ' s OOV are here .
<P> OOV has always been one of those OOV countries which are OOV in the OOV , and the OOV which OOV that country are always OOV .
OOV we now OOV the OOV , we OOV that , all of a OOV , the country could be OOV a OOV OOV , with economic OOV of OOV % of the OOV OOV OOV , with OOV in OOV of no less than OOV % in the OOV years between OOV and OOV , and even OOV a OOV in the OOV OOV .
OOV now have three OOV OOV of OOV .
In OOV , you could be OOV for OOV that OOV is OOV in the right OOV , but , of course , this is the OOV between a country which is very , very , very OOV and a country which is only very , very OOV .
It OOV a problem if you OOV that OOV million people OOV under the OOV OOV , and you have economic OOV which cannot OOV up with the OOV OOV .
OOV of the OOV countries on the OOV OOV OOV , OOV does not come last , but OOV , which is very OOV indeed .
<P> So we welcome this OOV OOV of the country ' s OOV into the European market .
We think that this will have a OOV OOV , but we believe that we , OOV , should make a greater OOV to , for example , OOV new life into the OOV OOV which OOV a OOV .
Finally , I , too , would OOV for more use to be made of the human rights OOV which is OOV in the first OOV of the agreement , so as to OOV those OOV which Mr OOV OOV OOV OOV so OOV .
<SPEAKER OOV OOV " NAME=" OOV " > Mr President , Commissioner , today , at last , we have an opportunity to OOV our opinion on the new cooperation agreement OOV with OOV .
OOV OOV Member and rapporteur , Mr OOV OOV OOV , with OOV I OOV that country last year , has already OOV that we have OOV this .
But he also OOV some of the OOV OOV of the Committee on OOV and OOV as to what the Community ' s future action in OOV should be .
<P> OOV OOV to OOV what has already been OOV , I would OOV like to OOV some issues , on which we would also like to OOV the Commission ' s OOV .
This is the most OOV OOV of the OOV OOV countries ' .
The OOV of its economic situation , OOV by the OOV of the OOV sector , which OOV OOV OOV % of the working OOV , and also the OOV of social problems , are OOV by the most OOV OOV .
OOV as if this were not enough , there are also the OOV OOV that OOV OOV the country .
In OOV to these OOV , the political situation , as has already been mentioned , still OOV a OOV OOV of OOV on all OOV .
We were able to OOV this for OOV during our OOV to this still young country .
We OOV the OOV OOV and the problems OOV health and education but also some OOV that are OOV up , such as OOV OOV from cooperation , which are taking place at every level , OOV under the OOV of the government or which are being OOV by OOV , the OOV use of OOV , even OOV it OOV OOV OOV of people , and the role and the particularly difficult situation of women .
We also OOV the OOV OOV of OOV and of OOV OOV , and also the OOV and OOV of the OOV environmental and health OOV OOV by the OOV of OOV in OOV OOV .
<P> We were also able to see the OOV in the political OOV , which were quite clear in the OOV of great OOV that OOV relations between the government of Mrs OOV OOV of the OOV OOV and the OOV , particularly the OOV OOV of OOV , which does not OOV on a OOV basis in the work of the national OOV .
We also OOV the problems and OOV in OOV the conflict with the people in the OOV part of the country , OOV the OOV OOV OOV .
<P> As you all know , the European Union is OOV ' s main OOV OOV .
OOV OOV % of that country ' s OOV come to the European Union .
OOV has also OOV from various development OOV , such as aid for OOV and financial cooperation with OOV countries , OOV and OOV aid and OOV from OOV OOV on OOV .
The European Union has also OOV OOV with a OOV OOV of OOV aid that has been OOV for it and on which , in fact , the country is OOV OOV .
We also know that the current agreement OOV on from the OOV agreement , and can be OOV OOV to future needs .
<P> The question we now OOV now with regard to the OOV I have just OOV is to know what real OOV and OOV this new agreement OOV to achieve and in general , what OOV we hope to have on OOV development in the field of OOV and on the OOV of the public and public organisations in national life .
In the resolution that we adopted in the Committee on OOV and OOV , we OOV the OOV that we OOV to be the most appropriate .
Mr OOV OOV OOV has already mentioned them in his OOV .
We now hope that the Commission will OOV its agreement or OOV with the OOV that we OOV .
We also hope , however , that the Commission will state to what OOV it will be OOV to provide political support for OOV in order to OOV the problems to which I OOV OOV .
OOV the OOV that the government and the OOV have already made we would also like the Commission to OOV us how it OOV to support the OOV OOV process and whether it will be OOV a OOV to OOV the OOV that have already been OOV for this year .
<SPEAKER OOV NAME=" OOV " > Mr President , OOV me first of all say that I feel it is a OOV to OOV these OOV , as we are OOV here on the basis of your report .
For me it OOV a OOV of OOV political OOV .
We agree on your report and we welcome it very much and this is not just OOV , it is also really OOV for OOV and other OOV .
It is very OOV that we in Europe should OOV agree on how to work with our OOV .
If we were OOV OOV without any OOV of OOV , they would not have a good OOV , so it is really important that we agree .
<P> A year OOV I OOV OOV OOV as my first OOV on a OOV OOV field OOV .
We OOV there after the OOV OOV in OOV .
I OOV to go to a OOV OOV country to start in the right place .
I also OOV to start in a country as Commissioner OOV field OOV , a country that I OOV well already in order to better be able to OOV how the Commission OOV .
If I OOV to a country I did not know , there would be too many OOV OOV , but this one I OOV quite well and I am OOV to say that I was OOV OOV by what I OOV in the field .
We were OOV to the OOV women , we were further out in the OOV than I had OOV and we OOV more through OOV OOV than I had OOV .
This is a good basis and also one of the OOV why Parliament and Commission are in OOV about where we go now .
<P> There are OOV problems to OOV with the Government of OOV , OOV its OOV : it OOV as OOV as the Commission , so the two of them have a OOV to OOV about , but we know that and we are clear about it OOV OOV OOV problems are clear and OOV , but OOV do not OOV to them by also being OOV and OOV in your OOV process " .
<P> This is why the new agreement that we are now OOV on is so important , because it , in fact , OOV cooperation one OOV further forward and OOV OOV .
We will go from one country to another OOV the world and OOV what we are OOV up to OOV OOV OOV the basis of cooperation and OOV .
So this is all very good <P> As to the OOV that have been put OOV the OOV , on OOV OOV we are OOV the OOV OOV from the Commission over there and we will be OOV , OOV and OOV to OOV OOV of Parliament in an OOV OOV .
If this is what we OOV OOV to do , we think it may be very OOV .
OOV has done quite a number of OOV things in recent years : OOV , OOV more with OOV OOV and OOV OOV to very OOV problems .
As to the OOV OOV OOV , we take the view that the issue there is OOV too OOV .
I OOV this when I was there in OOV last year .
On the other hand , problems OOV to OOV and other things are very difficult to OOV in any country .
The OOV is important and I believe they are OOV to do something OOV .
<P> What Mr OOV OOV OOV has mentioned OOV OOV OOV and the many OOV in OOV is OOV and important .
OOV OOV have taken place there .
OOV is a great OOV and it is not only one very OOV OOV that has been OOV .
But I would come back , when we OOV about development in OOV , to the role of women .
This is quite OOV .
OOV OOV to change the life and the situation of OOV is OOV , but I would , in fact , point to the many young women and OOV in the OOV OOV who in a OOV way OOV the OOV way of OOV .
The OOV - not having OOV - is quite OOV , but the OOV of OOV they have are also very OOV .
At the end of the OOV our OOV , the OOV for them to our market , is part of the hope of these women and of OOV , so I think we are on the right OOV and I very much OOV the support and the agreement that we have on what to do in OOV .
<SPEAKER OOV NAME=" OOV , OOV " > Mr President , I am very OOV to be able to OOV in this debate on European Union cooperation with OOV , a country I know well , a country I was OOV to OOV with the European Parliament 's OOV in the OOV of OOV .
<P> There are , of course , a great number of people with OOV OOV OOV in OOV and other OOV of the European Union , people OOV from OOV , OOV and other OOV of OOV .
<P> I know from them and from my OOV that OOV is a country of OOV , OOV people and a country with great OOV , but one which does need OOV from the more OOV and OOV OOV of the world like the European Union .
<P> This report OOV provide that support and should be OOV , and OOV I OOV OOV OOV to the rapporteur and my other OOV .
But the rapporteur said something which OOV me , as did Mrs OOV .
The rapporteur said that state OOV in OOV work OOV and Mrs OOV OOV some of the OOV that OOV has made in recent years .
OOV in many OOV I think that OOV is OOV for the way that it does work .
It does work OOV its OOV and OOV OOV , OOV the political problems , OOV its other OOV and OOV the OOV .
It does OOV and , as the Commissioner has just said , that is OOV OOV all the OOV .
I believe that this is OOV a OOV to the people and indeed to the Government of OOV .
<P> OOV on the positive OOV - and some of you from other countries may not be aware of this - OOV has OOV been OOV as a full OOV OOV OOV OOV .
OOV more OOV , OOV of OOV OOV have now been OOV in the OOV of OOV .
The European Parliament has to help ensure that OOV is not OOV by the OOV OOV OOV , that it is able to use its OOV OOV and to OOV them at the most OOV OOV , which may not OOV just to OOV or to OOV .
<P> The OOV OOV may OOV OOV but it does OOV a OOV to OOV and OOV will do well in this field of OOV OOV and this will be an OOV to OOV of people in that country .
<P> The report OOV it clear that if the European Union OOV in OOV with local people it can help on OOV issues .
It can help with OOV OOV , the OOV to OOV for OOV .
A OOV or OOV country cannot OOV a OOV OOV OOV two OOV OOV OOV .
The OOV that a OOV OOV is OOV the OOV out of OOV must be OOV and women , all women , must be able to OOV whether or not to have OOV .
<P> European OOV must also make certain that they do not OOV the OOV OOV and do not OOV OOV the working environment in OOV , where the women OOV and work very long OOV for very OOV OOV .
OOV the European Union has the OOV to help with other problems in OOV - the OOV that we have OOV about , that OOV great OOV of the OOV on a OOV basis is not OOV .
Europe has the OOV to OOV the OOV .
We have the OOV and OOV , for example in the OOV , to help improve OOV OOV and OOV OOV to OOV .
We , as a European Union , already help OOV with OOV , with OOV country OOV , and with the OOV OOV to OOV that this OOV with it .
But we can , I believe , and we must do more .
<P> The future of OOV also OOV on its OOV .
OOV my OOV too many of the young people in OOV OOV to be OOV OOV in Europe and the United States , which I OOV , which is good ; but then many of them do not go back to OOV to take back their education , their OOV and their great OOV .
We must OOV them to do so .
<P> I will end as I OOV , by OOV that OOV is a country with a future .
OOV as the last part of the OOV OOV OOV to the countries of OOV OOV , the OOV OOV , I believe that the first part of this OOV can OOV to the countries of OOV OOV .
OOV help from this Parliament , OOV can OOV in that OOV of OOV , in the OOV , the OOV and OOV the OOV that will OOV .
<SPEAKER OOV OOV OOV " > Mr President , like OOV in this OOV , I am one of the OOV group of people who has OOV OOV , not OOV OOV like the Commissioner but in such a way as to be able to form some OOV OOV , and it is against that OOV that I wish to OOV how important it is for cooperation between the EU and OOV to be OOV and OOV further .
There are a number of conditions present in OOV that are not present in a number of other OOV countries , in as much as OOV - and this , I think , is very important - has only one OOV and one OOV and OOV of only one OOV group , which means that the OOV OOV we see , for example , in OOV do not OOV there .
OOV do OOV OOV .
However , it also means that it would be still OOV if we were to OOV down just such a country , OOV because OOV does not have a number of the problems we see in other countries , and we should be OOV the country if we were not to OOV a good deal in terms of aid , including development aid .
OOV can only OOV its own if we are OOV to help the country , and that means both the EU , as the Commissioner mentioned , and also the Member States , OOV which I can call attention to my own country , OOV , which is one of the OOV OOV of aid in the area .
<P> There are three points I should like to OOV in OOV to the general need for aid and development .
There is the need for good OOV and support for democracy .
OOV have OOV upon these , so I shall not OOV further upon them .
There is the need to continue OOV to OOV women ' s OOV , for example by OOV and OOV further our support for OOV .
OOV OOV a good deal of OOV in OOV and , as a number of OOV have already OOV this out I shall not go into any more OOV on this subject OOV .
In this OOV , I should like to say that women were OOV those who OOV me OOV most OOV following my OOV .
However , I should like to OOV our need to make further progress now .
We cannot be OOV with OOV .
We must OOV on to the next OOV of development , whether it be concerned with OOV or something OOV .
I come , then , to my third point , which the Commissioner OOV OOV a rather different view of .
I believe that , in this OOV , we can OOV make use of information and OOV OOV , OOV in order to support women too - since they are now a OOV of society - and so as to give a OOV to their OOV and , all in all , to OOV the country ' s further development .
<SPEAKER OOV OOV OOV " > Mr President , we very much welcome the cooperation agreement which is an OOV of the good relations between the European Union and OOV and OOV a framework for their further OOV .
OOV OOV of the agreement OOV with regional cooperation , and I would OOV like to OOV on two points which OOV to OOV 's regional situation and OOV OOV with OOV countries .
<P> OOV there is still some OOV in OOV areas with OOV , there has been a great OOV in relations between the two countries .
OOV of this has been the OOV of the OOV OOV Treaty with OOV .
OOV this there has been an OOV agreement for OOV the OOV of the OOV OOV and OOV OOV in OOV the OOV report on the OOV OOV OOV which will be OOV on OOV OOV .
The two countries have also OOV OOV OOV on OOV OOV which have OOV both countries with OOV OOV .
This cooperation is good OOV and to be OOV and OOV .
I have to say I do not see the same positive approach on the part of the OOV authorities .
In fact , in the last few OOV , there have been OOV OOV by the OOV in support of OOV OOV to OOV a OOV on the OOV OOV OOV to the OOV OOV , OOV OOV OOV OOV of OOV 's OOV .
In the OOV , such OOV have OOV in military action .
A particularly OOV OOV of this OOV is that OOV OOV have OOV been OOV OOV the OOV by the OOV .
OOV is the only OOV OOV country to have OOV the OOV OOV OOV these OOV .
OOV , OOV is not a OOV to the OOV and there are OOV that OOV has OOV OOV OOV OOV OOV including on agricultural OOV .
<P> OOV should OOV to the OOV OOV Treaty OOV and OOV should take OOV to OOV the Treaty .
I hope the Commission and Council will OOV these points in their OOV with both countries .
<P> On a OOV matter , the report OOV the OOV of OOV OOV in OOV on OOV security and economic development .
The OOV of OOV million is OOV to OOV to over OOV million by OOV .
This OOV a OOV OOV OOV for OOV including to the European Union .
OOV must OOV the OOV of OOV who are OOV in the OOV of an EU Member State .
This is OOV in the OOV OOV to the cooperation agreement .
It is important that the Government of OOV should take OOV OOV to OOV into negotiations with those Member States that so wish and to OOV OOV OOV OOV OOV .
<P> I OOV the Commission will also OOV importance to this .
<SPEAKER OOV NAME=" OOV " > Mr President , I would first like to say a few words about the OOV of OOV organisations and OOV 's role as a OOV of the OOV OOV .
A year OOV there were quite OOV problems and I OOV to see if it were possible to OOV the OOV OOV .
There was no agreement between our Member States to do what we in the Commission would have OOV to do , which OOV the OOV that we have been going through with this OOV .
<P> The good OOV , however , is that the need has been OOV for a OOV OOV , OOV in OOV I hope , to OOV the use and new OOV of OOV as a OOV OOV , so OOV it is now possible to continue with the OOV of what the OOV OOV OOV could do .
There was a meeting in OOV at the OOV of OOV and all the different parties agreed to OOV what is OOV an international OOV OOV group .
The OOV proposal for the OOV of this OOV will be OOV and OOV OOV at the meeting of the OOV OOV OOV to be OOV in OOV at the end of this OOV .
OOV it will be OOV to OOV in OOV and , once adopted , OOV for OOV and OOV to the OOV concerned and the OOV OOV OOV .
<P> So we now have very high OOV that a new OOV that can OOV OOV international cooperation in the OOV sector will come out of the long OOV OOV about the OOV OOV OOV .
This is very good because the OOV OOV OOV is the only international OOV of this OOV that is actually OOV in a OOV country .
This is what I can report on this matter that was OOV up in our OOV here .
<P> OOV Mrs OOV I would say : OOV , it is a OOV OOV for OOV that it is a OOV and we OOV should OOV the use of that OOV .
The OOV OOV OOV problem is a OOV to that OOV of OOV but OOV , OOV to the OOV , the OOV are OOV and they still OOV set on the right course .
<P> As to the role of OOV in OOV , OOV of course we will OOV to be OOV and do something but I do not OOV see it as an OOV OOV , so we will OOV to the OOV OOV of our agreement with OOV .
But we will use OOV in all possible OOV .
As to what you say about OOV OOV on women in this respect , I would say that OOV may be one of the OOV where it would be possible to OOV with this .
So we should be open to these OOV .
<P> I agree very much with what Mr OOV OOV said about the regional OOV .
It OOV that OOV is the OOV OOV OOV and we certainly should OOV this as a fact and we should OOV to OOV in that OOV .
It has OOV who are not all very OOV and the whole region is more OOV than we may often think .
There are some OOV million OOV OOV OOV in OOV .
That is a OOV number in a European OOV , so from the point of view of OOV , OOV , OOV OOV and so on , it really is OOV quite some OOV .
<P> OOV me once again thank you for this very positive debate .
I look forward to working with Parliament on our relations with OOV .
OOV are OOV so OOV there that OOV to the OOV we may be able in just a few years to OOV and to OOV real OOV as a result of our cooperation there , and it is a great OOV .
<P> Finally , we look forward very much to OOV OOV as one of the OOV OOV in our OOV in OOV in OOV on OOV , to be OOV with OOV
This will be a OOV opportunity for OOV and the other OOV countries to present themselves not as OOV on a OOV OOV in OOV , with the OOV of the world OOV at them like OOV OOV , but as OOV in the OOV society , OOV OOV and OOV which are important in OOV OOV the OOV of OOV .
So we are also OOV forward to that OOV .
<P> The first OOV OOV Committee meeting under the new cooperation agreement is now OOV for the first OOV of OOV OOV , so the OOV is on the OOV .
<SPEAKER OOV NAME=" President " > I have OOV a OOV for a resolution OOV OOV to OOV OOV ) .
<P> The OOV debate is OOV .
<P> The vote will take place OOV at OOV OOV .
<P> ( The OOV was OOV at OOV OOV ){"name": "ep-01-01-17.txt"}ÅÚOOV OOV OOV of depleted uranium in OOV and OOV ( OOV OOV ) <SPEAKER OOV NAME=" President " > The next OOV is the Council and Commission OOV on the use of depleted uranium in OOV and OOV .
<P> I shall give the OOV to the OOV of the Council , Mr OOV OOV .
<SPEAKER OOV LANGUAGE="SV" NAME=" OOV " > Madam President , ladies and gentlemen , Members of the Commission , the information OOV health OOV OOV by depleted uranium to the OOV and to OOV in OOV OOV in the OOV , as well as its possible environmental OOV , has OOV great concern in Europe .
It is a concern which must be taken with the OOV OOV .
The issue OOV to be OOV by organisations and OOV with OOV within this area .
<P> In OOV of last year , OOV of the United OOV OOV OOV ( OOV ) and of the OOV OOV OOV OOV ( OOV ) OOV OOV .
OOV has been working for some time on a report on the OOV and OOV OOV of the use of depleted uranium in the OOV .
We welcome this report , together with the report which the OOV OOV OOV ( OOV ) is at present in the process of OOV on the same subject .
<P> The issue of possible health OOV to those OOV who take part in OOV efforts in the OOV is OOV a responsibility for OOV and OOV States .
The EU countries which take part in these OOV do so on the basis of national decisions .
In the interests of the OOV possible OOV on the issue , OOV are , however , being OOV within OOV OOV OOV .
A OOV is to take place over OOV during the meeting with the OOV OOV Council on OOV OOV .
<P> This also OOV us of how important it is that the OOV upon health and the environment of military OOV management OOV should be OOV now that the EU is OOV its OOV management OOV .
This is a OOV part of a OOV management OOV ' s OOV , and work of this OOV is being done both within OOV and the OOV , as well as within the OOV
<P> The issue of the possible health OOV and environmental OOV involved in the use of depleted uranium also OOV attention to a very important issue : that of the general environmental problems in the OOV .
The OOV of OOV , OOV and other OOV countries in the OOV have been OOV OOV , with OOV and OOV OOV .
It is in the interests of Europe as a whole to OOV these OOV in cooperation with the OOV in the region , which are all OOV and OOV .
OOV the Commission ' s aid programme , the EU is OOV support to the countries of the region in their efforts to get to OOV with their environmental problems .
<SPEAKER OOV LANGUAGE="ES " NAME=" OOV " > Madam President , ladies and gentlemen , I am OOV OOV to you for OOV me the opportunity to OOV on a matter which I believe , as I am OOV you will agree , OOV OOV to be OOV with as a matter of OOV priority by Parliament .
It is only right that we should be concerned for the health of our military OOV , of the citizens of the OOV and of those working for Community OOV , OOV OOV , international organisations and Member State organisations OOV in the area .
I therefore OOV the OOV OOV OOV the health of all these people .
<P> I should like to OOV by OOV my OOV with all those who are OOV health problems , who are concerned about their OOV and who are OOV from OOV .
The fact is that there are many such OOV and they are OOV to OOV the best OOV available .
They have the right to be OOV of the OOV of their OOV without OOV , and we shall OOV all our energy to OOV so .
We are all under an OOV to do what is OOV to ensure that the OOV information is available to those concerned .
<P> I OOV before you today as OOV of the Council , but I am also here in my OOV as the OOV OOV for the Union ' s OOV and OOV OOV .
In OOV with the OOV which have given OOV to concern in the House , I shall OOV to do so from the Council ' s point of view .
<P> I should first like to OOV my OOV OOV and the OOV of all Members of Council to this region , OOV the OOV .
I am OOV they will make every OOV to help OOV the situation .
<P> OOV OOV are OOV , they have OOV to OOV , and it is our OOV to forward Parliament all the information available at any given time .
<P> Madam President , ladies and gentlemen , the OOV issue we are OOV with is to OOV clearly whether there is a OOV between the use of these OOV and the OOV OOV by the OOV or by those who OOV in OOV OOV in the OOV , or whether , on the OOV , the OOV of these OOV is no different from that OOV OOV OOV our OOV .
<P> This is the question we have to OOV .
<P> If we are to provide a clear OOV to it , we must OOV in as OOV a OOV as possible .
We should OOV : if this really were a OOV in the OOV OOV of the OOV , then all those OOV would OOV OOV OOV .
In time , those OOV would OOV in a OOV way , and the OOV would also be OOV .
That is what is OOV OOV by the OOV OOV .
So these are the OOV we must OOV and we should deal with them in a fully open and OOV OOV .
<P> OOV of us involved in OOV the OOV must OOV our OOV on OOV and not on OOV OOV .
OOV , if we are to OOV the OOV , we must have OOV to all the information available .
We must make a particular point of OOV OOV and OOV OOV OOV .
OOV we are aware of the OOV , we should OOV them in such a way that all the results we make public OOV OOV and OOV OOV .
OOV work is indeed OOV by this OOV .
<P> OOV OOV and OOV must be common to all : they must OOV all the Member States of the European Union , OOV between the Member States of the Union and OOV , and those between OOV and other OOV involved in OOV OOV in the OOV .
OOV they must also OOV OOV between OOV in the region .
<P> OOV , the European Union ' s OOV and OOV Committee OOV with this matter on OOV OOV .
Member States OOV their concerns and information on the measures each had taken , as the current presidency OOV .
There was OOV agreement that OOV , as the OOV that had OOV responsibility for OOV the OOV OOV , should be OOV with OOV information from all those involved OOV the use of depleted uranium , the OOV of military OOV , and all OOV OOV .
<P> As you are aware , ladies and gentlemen , at that meeting the Commission also OOV the measures it OOV to take .
I am OOV that the Commission will today be able to OOV information on the measures it has taken , OOV through Commissioner OOV or through OOV OOV .
<P> As OOV OOV , I have to OOV you that as OOV as the matter OOV public , I OOV OOV the OOV .
We have OOV in OOV OOV OOV since .
The OOV , his OOV and the Council ' s OOV have OOV that we have all OOV each other as OOV and up to OOV with OOV as possible .
<P> OOV me to OOV OOV the measures taken by OOV at its meeting on OOV OOV : first , it OOV a meeting of national military OOV OOV to OOV them to make OOV with each other and OOV the whole OOV of OOV , OOV information , OOV , OOV .
A working group was set up OOV to OOV as a OOV for OOV information .
I think it is important to OOV that OOV of this group was open to all countries who had OOV some part in OOV OOV in the OOV , not just to OOV OOV .
<P> It was also agreed to OOV more OOV with the countries in the region .
OOV the matter was OOV with the OOV OOV OOV , Mr OOV OOV , on OOV OOV .
OOV was OOV that all of us , especially OOV , would forward all available information .
<P> In OOV , it was agreed to make all information OOV this OOV available to the United OOV OOV OOV .
OOV , as you are aware , OOV OOV OOV their view that at that time there was no OOV to OOV that the use of the OOV in question OOV a OOV OOV for the OOV OOV of the countries involved , or for the OOV OOV of the OOV .
<P> OOV has also made it quite clear that it is by OOV a military OOV , not a OOV one .
It is therefore OOV to OOV all the necessary information to the European Union .
It fully OOV to do so , to OOV better OOV organisations , OOV the OOV OOV OOV , the United OOV OOV OOV and the OOV OOV OOV OOV to OOV the appropriate OOV .
<P> As you know ladies and gentlemen , OOV s OOV Committee OOV its first meeting on OOV OOV OOV , and the OOV OOV group for the OOV of information OOV for the first time OOV .
You are aware of the OOV of that OOV OOV , it has been OOV and OOV on the OOV OOV OOV , together with the OOV OOV OOV at OOV ' s meeting .
<P> I think it is OOV OOV once again that , at OOV s OOV , OOV of the group OOV with the OOV of information will be open to all OOV Member States of the European Union , and that OOV OOV is fully OOV .
As the presidency has OOV OOV , the next OOV will be to OOV the OOV of OOV OOV as it OOV available .
OOV with Mr OOV , OOV OOV and President of Council , Union OOV OOV will also deal with the matter at the first meeting of the OOV OOV Council on OOV OOV .
<P> I am OOV that this is a OOV way of OOV at the OOV , to ensure that we OOV all the information OOV and OOV at OOV OOV OOV on OOV .
<P> As you may OOV , I have OOV in OOV with the OOV of all Member States , and I must say to you , quite OOV , that if a report OOV to a possible OOV does OOV , I will OOV see that it is OOV to the House .
I OOV you that .
I should , however , state that to OOV , the Council has not OOV a OOV OOV report OOV a OOV between these OOV and the use of depleted uranium OOV .
OOV me OOV once more , ladies and gentlemen , that if such a report does OOV you will be made aware of it OOV .
<P> I should OOV that since I was OOV to OOV before the House , that is , in the last few OOV and OOV , some countries have OOV OOV reports .
I OOV for example to the reports OOV by the Committee of the OOV OOV OOV OOV OOV .
I believe this is a OOV well OOV OOV .
In OOV with the OOV of OOV OOV , I OOV to say that OOV and OOV have already OOV what are to all OOV and OOV their OOV OOV .
<P> OOV and gentlemen , this is what the European Union is OOV , OOV to go on OOV and will continue to do , in that OOV of OOV and good cooperation the OOV mentioned OOV .
So much then , for information .
<P> I do not however believe that it would be right , at a OOV OOV like today ' s , OOV to OOV on the OOV OOV of information OOV available without OOV it in the OOV OOV we find OOV in .
As I OOV before this House , which OOV the people of Europe , I am OOV to say that we need to OOV our OOV point and the OOV OOV OOV today ' s debate .
We must not OOV OOV from it .
The OOV OOV OOV this debate is that there was a problem OOV OOV to respect human rights in OOV , which this very House OOV time and again .
<P> Madam President , I cannot OOV how , when OOV as OOV OOV for my country in OOV , I used to OOV the OOV and OOV OOV at in this House very OOV .
OOV them , OOV OOV of Union countries were being OOV to take action and not to OOV such OOV OOV for human rights in OOV OOV to OOV .
<P> ( OOV and OOV ) <P> I have an even OOV OOV of when I OOV before you in this very House in OOV , as President of the Council of OOV of the European Union , and you OOV OOV with me , OOV for action to OOV a OOV .
We did take action , OOV on of course by the good OOV of all OOV countries who wish to OOV the rights being OOV in OOV .
<P> That is what we OOV to do .
OOV I should like to OOV you OOV <P> ( OOV and OOV ) with all OOV respect and in a OOV of OOV , that the House OOV adopted important OOV on the situation in OOV .
<P> We must not OOV our OOV point .
I believe we have to find time in this OOV debate not only for the OOV which are the subject of current OOV , OOV we are OOV to OOV through to the end because we OOV OOV OOV , but also for the OOV OOV of the whole problem .
That is OOV other than the serious OOV of human rights in the OOV , part of Europe , our own OOV .
We OOV to put an end to it as best we could with the means available to the countries of the European Union and to OOV OOV .
<P> As I OOV , I would like to take you back to the last OOV OOV we OOV together .
You will OOV that on OOV OOV , in this very House , OOV in this very OOV , I was OOV to OOV a OOV OOV OOV with you all : the time when the Parliament in OOV OOV to OOV to the OOV .
<P> OOV us not OOV what we have OOV .
OOV us not OOV the positive OOV OOV up to the OOV OOV .
That was the first time that the OOV OOV of the European Union OOV with all the OOV of the OOV countries , and that every one of them had been OOV OOV .
<P> Finally , ladies and gentlemen , I want to say with some OOV that in recent years I have , as you can OOV , been OOV involved in OOV to OOV a more OOV Europe , a Europe in which human rights are OOV .
I shall do OOV in my OOV to ensure respect for the OOV I mentioned OOV : the OOV approach , the OOV of OOV , OOV OOV , since that is what we are .
I shall also do my best to ensure that the OOV we have available at any given time are OOV to the House .
<P> As I have said in all OOV , no OOV has so far OOV between the OOV and the OOV .
That is what the OOV OOV are OOV .
I also want to state , however , that we cannot and must not be OOV with this .
OOV me OOV that the Council and I are fully OOV to OOV the OOV of this matter through to the end .
<P> Madam President , ladies and gentlemen , I have OOV no OOV that we shall all be OOV to those OOV OOV I OOV to : responsibility , OOV and OOV .
<P> OOV you for your attention .
<P> ( OOV and OOV ) <SPEAKER OOV NAME=" President " > OOV OOV the OOV to Mrs OOV , to OOV on behalf of the Commission , I have OOV a OOV for a OOV OOV from Mr OOV .
In view of the fact that we cannot possible OOV our debate on the basis of OOV OOV , I would ask you to OOV OOV me OOV , Mr OOV , in OOV with the terms of the OOV of OOV , to which OOV your OOV OOV OOV .
<P> ( The President OOV Mr OOV the OOV after he had OOV that his point OOV to OOV OOV ) <SPEAKER OOV OOV NAME=" OOV " > Madam President , under OOV OOV of our OOV of OOV , the Council and the Commission may ask to make a OOV to the European Parliament ; however it is up to the President of the European Parliament , it is OOV up to you to OOV the debate .
In this OOV , and because the debate is public and European public opinion is OOV by what it has OOV , I think that we all have an OOV , if we are to OOV being OOV of OOV , to ask the OOV OOV of the OOV OOV and OOV OOV of the European Union who , OOV OOV was the OOV of OOV and who is under OOV by the OOV OOV in the OOV for OOV against OOV , OOV to a OOV by the public OOV in the OOV and other OOV , to OOV why , as OOV of OOV , he OOV the OOV for a OOV OOV OOV in the OOV .
OOV as Mr OOV has OOV part of the OOV on to the European Parliament .
You must give a OOV here .
OOV has said that we , too , are OOV responsible for the OOV OOV OOV because we OOV for action in the OOV .
<SPEAKER OOV NAME=" President " > I would OOV you that we agreed on the OOV of this debate at the OOV of OOV last OOV .
<P> I shall give the OOV OOV OOV to Mrs OOV , to OOV on behalf of the Commission .
<SPEAKER OOV NAME=" OOV " > Madam President , before I OOV to the specific question of depleted uranium , OOV me first put the issue in OOV by OOV a OOV about the environmental situation in the OOV and what the European Commission has been OOV to OOV it .
<P> OOV a OOV of regional OOV , OOV with OOV OOV , OOV OOV industry and a OOV of years of OOV OOV , have OOV the environment of the OOV region in a state of serious OOV .
In OOV OOV , a report OOV for the Commission by the OOV OOV OOV in OOV OOV a OOV OOV of the environmental OOV of the conflict in the OOV region .
In OOV OOV , the United OOV OOV OOV OOV then OOV its OOV of the environmental OOV OOV as a result of the OOV conflict .
<P> In our efforts to OOV the health and environmental situation in the OOV , the Commission has OOV a OOV approach .
This OOV action on the one hand to OOV OOV problems with OOV OOV OOV .
OOV OOV OOV is OOV to OOV a process of OOV environmental OOV in the countries in the region , all of which are OOV OOV OOV of the Union .
<P> OOV me set out OOV what we have been OOV .
In the framework of the OOV OOV , the Commission has been the OOV OOV in the development of the OOV OOV OOV OOV .
This OOV a framework in which environmental OOV can be OOV at regional level in the OOV .
OOV OOV together the various OOV OOV and the countries in the region , we are OOV a OOV for the OOV of OOV OOV and OOV OOV OOV .
<P> OOV help OOV the OOV OOV OOV OOV the Commission is OOV OOV OOV to the OOV of EUR OOV .
OOV OOV have OOV a further EUR OOV , and OOV still have OOV their OOV to OOV OOV another EUR OOV , OOV a OOV of OOV EUR OOV .
<P> OOV these OOV we have OOV OOV OOV , OOV in the OOV of the European OOV OOV in the region and two environmental OOV in OOV and the OOV OOV OOV of OOV .
OOV contribution OOV the OOV between OOV the basis for OOV environmental OOV and OOV OOV action .
<P> OOV me now come to the specific issue of depleted uranium and the public concern about the possible health OOV OOV with the use of depleted uranium OOV in OOV and OOV for the local OOV , as well as the international OOV OOV , or who have OOV , in the region .
The Commission is OOV also concerned to ensure that the interests of its own OOV and OOV OOV in the region are OOV OOV .
<P> OOV me OOV again that this is an issue which has OOV OOV public OOV and that OOV must be OOV .
But it can only be OOV on the basis of OOV and the OOV of all the information on this issue .
OOV OOV must be OOV " .
That is why it is OOV to OOV OOV and on the basis of OOV OOV .
<P> What then are the OOV ?
OOV itself , as you know , is a OOV and OOV OOV that OOV in OOV OOV .
OOV uranium is less OOV than OOV uranium .
It is OOV available as a OOV of the OOV OOV OOV and it is very OOV and OOV .
As such , it is used to make OOV to OOV to increase their OOV OOV .
However , there is OOV no OOV OOV OOV opinion on the health and environmental OOV of depleted uranium .
<P> At the time that the OOV OOV OOV OOV OOV its OOV OOV of the environmental OOV OOV as a result of the OOV conflict , it had not OOV any OOV OOV OOV whether or not depleted uranium had been used during the conflict .
OOV that OOV was given , OOV OOV out a OOV to OOV , for example , OOV , OOV and OOV OOV in OOV last year .
We OOV that the results of their OOV will be OOV in OOV this year .
<P> For our part , the Commission has OOV OOV in the OOV of recent concerns to ensure that any Commission action on depleted uranium is OOV on OOV OOV OOV .
We have used OOV OOV to OOV a meeting of an OOV group of OOV under the OOV Treaty to give an opinion on the possible health OOV in general of OOV to depleted uranium .
In their opinion the OOV will be OOV to OOV upon all available OOV OOV .
We OOV to have the OOV opinion of the OOV OOV within a OOV from now .
<P> In the OOV of the opinion the Commission will OOV whether or not OOV OOV are OOV , for our own OOV for example .
We will also OOV whether it is appropriate to OOV OOV OOV programmes within the OOV OOV with the OOV of OOV the OOV development of the region .
<P> The Commission will , of course , OOV Member States and international authorities to OOV information on their OOV and OOV and to OOV any OOV OOV OOV OOV from the opinion OOV by the OOV OOV OOV .
<P> The OOV approach I have set out OOV the OOV OOV of the Community contribution to OOV the health and environmental situation in the OOV region .
The Commission OOV its OOV to OOV our OOV and OOV support to improve the environmental and human health situation in the OOV region .
<P> <SPEAKER OOV LANGUAGE="DE " NAME=" OOV " > Madam President , the OOV is concerned , because there are OOV of a OOV between this depleted uranium in OOV and OOV on people 's health and on the environment .
At the same time , however , we are aware that there is no OOV yet of the OOV of such a OOV .
OOV a OOV OOV OOV , not one of the OOV that have been OOV in OOV , OOV or other countries , has come up with OOV .
<P> For this reason , following on from the OOV made here by the OOV OOV of the EU , OOV OOV , I should like to say that this OOV does not in any way OOV to a OOV of OOV OOV .
The OOV OOV in OOV and in OOV by the OOV of OOV and of EU Member States were OOV against a OOV OOV .
We OOV an OOV OOV of OOV to these people for having OOV themselves in this way to the OOV of human rights .
OOV who OOV political and military responsibility also OOV our OOV .
OOV me state that here OOV on behalf of my group .
<P> We OOV , however , that the OOV OOV set OOV OOV OOV on OOV , OOV which result in the OOV of uranium OOV , for example , and which may OOV problems .
OOV the OOV few OOV we have been OOV about OOV OOV by the OOV in OOV 2000 from which it OOV that this OOV OOV OOV small OOV of OOV too .
This OOV OOV , and the OOV must be OOV to take particular OOV in areas where these OOV have been OOV .
<P> In view of these OOV , it is indeed necessary to OOV OOV for safety 's OOV .
These OOV are not a OOV of OOV but a OOV of the OOV of OOV which OOV such OOV and OOV OOV under the OOV .
We OOV that to the military OOV and the OOV of OOV organisations who were involved , as well as to the OOV OOV of the region .
We must OOV whether there are actually OOV on human health and the environment , so that we can OOV OOV the OOV or take such OOV out of OOV for all time .
At the same time , it is also OOV , during the OOV in which these OOV and their OOV are being OOV , that OOV OOV OOV be used which is OOV OOV without having any of the OOV OOV .
<P> OOV I OOV my OOV to OOV OOV and the Commission for their OOV to OOV the European Parliament OOV , so that we can make our OOV OOV in OOV course on the basis of their information and OOV OOV the safety of our citizens and our OOV as well as OOV the OOV of any military OOV we may have to OOV in future in OOV of human rights .
<SPEAKER OOV OOV " NAME=" OOV > Madam President , I would like to start by OOV the Commission , the Council and the OOV OOV for OOV to take part in a debate on this subject and to OOV the OOV OOV that we are not going to OOV here a OOV debate on the OOV OOV the OOV in the OOV OOV ; it would not be right , OOV from OOV OOV because the OOV has OOV OOV .
OOV we have a OOV hope of including these countries in the European Union ; OOV we were in the OOV of the OOV of OOV OOV and OOV OOV by the OOV OOV of OOV , OOV and OOV .
<P> It is appropriate for the European Parliament to be the OOV for a responsible , OOV debate on the issue of the possible OOV between the use of depleted uranium OOV and a OOV number of OOV and OOV of OOV health OOV the OOV of different countries who have OOV in OOV , OOV in OOV and more OOV in OOV , and on the concern OOV the OOV and OOV OOV on the OOV involved .
There would be no OOV for OOV if there were no more than the OOV that the OOV of these OOV OOV the OOV for the same OOV OOV , and it is OOV for this reason that we must OOV the OOV OOV .
<P> OOV this end , various OOV have already been OOV at national and international level .
We call upon OOV itself to support these OOV , making use of the contribution of the OOV OOV where necessary .
In order to OOV all possible OOV from the world of OOV , we call upon the Council and the Commission to take an OOV part in this OOV OOV and OOV of information and we OOV the Commission to set in OOV its own OOV OOV OOV .
<P> OOV , the OOV and the OOV principle : this is not a question of OOV a principle , the OOV principle , which was OOV in the OOV of OOV safety , and OOV it OOV to OOV policy .
OOV , it is a matter of OOV that the military problem has become a OOV problem and concerns the OOV , for a long time after the OOV itself , of the health and OOV of OOV as well as OOV .
<SPEAKER OOV OOV NAME=" OOV " > Madam President , the Group of the European OOV , OOV and OOV OOV OOV to see OOV OOV by OOV and OOV .
OOV OOV and women must be able to report for OOV and OOV OOV in the OOV OOV that OOV is being done in the interests of their safety .
OOV OOV must be OOV , every OOV who is concerned must be able to OOV a OOV OOV OOV of OOV , and OOV who may have been OOV to OOV must OOV every attention and , if necessary , be OOV , OOV so that we can OOV from OOV .
It was , of course , out of regard for OOV that we OOV in OOV and OOV , and we did so on OOV OOV OOV .
The OOV must be OOV , they must be OOV out by OOV OOV and there must be OOV about OOV and possible OOV of OOV .
If there are any OOV at all for concern , OOV to depleted uranium must be OOV in and , OOV OOV has been OOV at , its use may have to be OOV .
I should like to thank Mr OOV for OOV that all information will be OOV .
We shall OOV OOV to this , and he will also be OOV to account if the OOV is not OOV .
I should also like to thank Mr OOV for OOV out our common responsibility for the military and OOV action , which is the reason why we are OOV here .
It did in fact OOV results and OOV the way for democracy in the OOV .
It was a OOV OOV to take that action , and we can be OOV that we OOV with that OOV .
<SPEAKER OOV LANGUAGE="FR" NAME=" OOV " > Madam President , Mr OOV of the Council , Commissioner , OOV OOV , I am OOV that this debate is taking place at last .
<P> We OOV - OOV - to have this debate during the last OOV OOV in OOV OOV , when the OOV OOV was OOV .
A few OOV after that , on OOV OOV to be OOV , because we were OOV that this OOV of OOV was being used , I together with OOV OOV Members OOV a OOV to Mr OOV , the then OOV OOV OOV , to OOV that a OOV be put to the use of such OOV which were OOV to OOV health problems at a OOV OOV for the local OOV and the military OOV involved , not to OOV OOV OOV of the environment .
<P> We did not OOV any OOV at that time .
I think that is OOV OOV out .
OOV OOV us with a OOV of information OOV .
In support of this , I would OOV you to the OOV made by the United OOV OOV OOV OOV group , at the end of OOV , that it did not have OOV OOV to OOV the state of depleted uranium OOV on the OOV of OOV .
<P> What Mr OOV has just OOV us , a few OOV OOV , OOV that the action taken would be OOV OOV , is OOV and it is good OOV , but I feel rather OOV OOV this OOV to OOV OOV the OOV adopted by OOV over the last year .
I feel even more OOV when I OOV the OOV of the current OOV OOV .
<P> There are a number of points which I should like to OOV .
I think this is necessary .
OOV we are OOV that a OOV must be OOV between the state of health of the military OOV and the OOV , or OOV , of depleted uranium , we have to be OOV , as this is no OOV matter , and there are OOV OOV which must be taken into OOV in order to OOV the OOV state of health of a number of OOV of the military : OOV OOV , a whole OOV of OOV of environmental OOV , OOV conditions .
It is OOV , OOV , that the OOV of OOV OOV do not become OOV OOV after a OOV long OOV of time .
It would not , therefore , be OOV to say at this OOV , as some OOV have done , rather OOV in my opinion , that there is no OOV .
It is too OOV to say .
OOV it is OOV for some military OOV , but I would be OOV if it were possible to OOV .
<P> OOV second point is that depleted uranium is not a OOV OOV OOV , as people would have us believe , or a less OOV one .
It is OOV OOV % less OOV than OOV uranium .
It is a OOV of OOV OOV and must OOV be OOV as OOV .
I would point out that we have a European directive adopted in OOV , which should have been OOV by the Member States , OOV that , where the OOV of such OOV OOV a OOV of OOV OOV OOV OOV , its OOV OOV must be OOV from OOV .
In this OOV we are OOV about a OOV that is OOV time greater .
It is therefore quite OOV to use OOV of this OOV to OOV it in the environment , OOV OOV OOV which OOV in the OOV and OOV system and then to OOV that the OOV of a problem OOV to be OOV .
OOV there is a problem here , of OOV , or I have OOV to OOV this European directive .
OOV should the conditions OOV to the people of Europe not be OOV to the people of OOV or OOV or to military OOV ?
<P> I should like to end with one last OOV .
OOV OOV me for going on a OOV too long .
Mr OOV , I must OOV you that the end does not OOV the means .
<P> ( OOV OOV is no one in this House that OOV the OOV OOV .
OOV it is not Mr OOV and his OOV who are the OOV of the OOV , who have OOV depleted uranium , but the local OOV , the military OOV and the OOV of OOV .
<P> ( OOV ) <SPEAKER OOV LANGUAGE="FR" NAME=" OOV " > Madam President , Mr OOV of the Council , Commissioner , OOV OOV , a OOV OOV , in OOV the OOV of OOV Rights , the OOV OOV to set themselves out as a OOV of OOV .
The OOV of such an OOV is not OOV by OOV OOV , but by our OOV OOV to OOV OOV , by means of OOV political OOV OOV by OOV OOV , even OOV this action , quite OOV , costs a great deal to those taking it .
OOV OOV is OOV when one ' s back is against the OOV .
<P> The OOV OOV , OOV years after the OOV OOV , is one such OOV OOV .
It OOV the OOV OOV with their OOV in a OOV OOV .
In my opinion and that of my group , OOV these OOV means taking OOV decisions in at least three OOV .
There is , OOV , the human OOV of the problem .
OOV have OOV , more are OOV , and still more are now OOV in OOV and in OOV of the future .
These people OOV military OOV and many OOV .
The OOV OOV about some OOV of OOV is that they continue to OOV OOV , OOV , after the OOV .
We are clearly OOV with a situation of this OOV in the OOV .
<P> In the OOV , the international OOV has done itself OOV by OOV OOV OOV on these OOV .
It should now , by the same OOV , OOV OOV OOV depleted uranium .
<P> It is up to the European countries which OOV them , including OOV OOV , OOV and , OOV , my own country , OOV , to agree to put an end to the OOV , OOV and , of course , the use , even OOV , of such OOV .
This would be OOV no more than to OOV with the OOV of the OOV OOV OOV , which OOV OOV with OOV OOV .
At the same time , all OOV must be OOV the right to health OOV , all OOV OOV must be OOV the right to OOV , and all the regions concerned must be OOV the right to OOV and OOV .
OOV OOV one ' s OOV by OOV today that the OOV OOV of these OOV had not been OOV at the time , even OOV a great many government OOV and OOV reports clearly OOV as much , really a serious and OOV OOV ?
I OOV feel that this is a OOV action , out of OOV in terms of the information now available to our OOV citizens .
<P> This OOV me to my second point , the OOV OOV which this OOV case OOV for us , for there is a long OOV of OOV OOV , OOV and OOV by OOV in which both OOV and some Member States have OOV as much as possible .
OOV agreed in the OOV to OOV as a OOV of OOV between these parties , Mr OOV , you cannot now be OOV to find that we are OOV you to give us some OOV OOV the serious OOV which are OOV OOV .
There is , as you have said , an OOV OOV for OOV OOV OOV OOV and OOV OOV future OOV , but , in all OOV , in this respect I do not think that OOV the OOV or OOV can OOV think they have OOV their OOV after what you have just OOV us , Mr OOV .
<P> ( OOV In the end , we must take this difficult OOV as an opportunity to OOV our OOV of the OOV of European security and relations between the European Union and OOV .
In our opinion it is high time that we OOV to OOV OOV , both on the European OOV and in the OOV of the world , to be OOV into the OOV OOV of OOV OOV OOV .
I am OOV of the OOV OOV of the OOV OOV on the OOV people , particularly the OOV .
I am OOV of the OOV OOV of the economic OOV and the OOV heritage not only of OOV but also of its OOV countries - take the OOV , for example - OOV , as we have just OOV , by OOV of the OOV use in this conflict of OOV and OOV which , in OOV to OOV OOV OOV OOV in the OOV OOV also OOV a OOV OOV for people OOV into OOV with the areas which have been OOV .
This , Mr OOV , has OOV to do with OOV human rights .
OOV as far as Europe is concerned , the end must not OOV the means .
<P> I am OOV that , one way or another , these are OOV which many people now have in OOV .
OOV is one OOV in the process , and it will be OOV by other OOV .
I hope that OOV OOV of us will OOV OOV with this OOV for change .
<P> ( OOV ) <SPEAKER OOV OOV " NAME=" OOV " > Madam President , ladies and gentlemen , Mr OOV , there are few OOV on which it can have been so important that the OOV of the matter , the whole OOV , OOV in a OOV debate as this one .
The OOV OOV of countries that OOV the European Union , whether they are OOV of OOV or not , OOV in various military and OOV OOV in the OOV , through their OOV OOV and security OOV .
They did so because they OOV that this was the most appropriate way to OOV OOV OOV and their OOV rights and to OOV to peace and to the country ' s OOV and OOV OOV .
<P> The situation is that in some of these countries , including my own country , OOV , OOV OOV OOV have OOV .
In OOV , these OOV are of OOV and other OOV OOV with OOV in OOV who OOV OOV in OOV or OOV , one of which has already OOV OOV .
<P> These OOV have OOV and continue to OOV , in OOV , OOV , military and political OOV and OOV in the OOV of the public of these countries , OOV concern at the possible OOV - which , I OOV , has not been OOV - between OOV to depleted uranium OOV in used OOV and the OOV of the OOV I have just mentioned .
It is therefore OOV to OOV the OOV of this OOV , first of all because important human OOV that OOV respect and OOV in the OOV of the OOV concerns of the OOV and their OOV are under OOV .
<P> OOV , because OOV information is as yet OOV and we need to OOV OOV a OOV whether there is a OOV and OOV OOV between the use of OOV OOV depleted uranium and the health problems that we have been OOV .
OOV , because it is OOV that there should still be OOV over the OOV of information that OOV OOV to have given the OOV and military authorities of the countries OOV in OOV in good time and the conditions under which their OOV OOV and the security OOV OOV part in military and OOV OOV .
<P> OOV , because it would be OOV and even OOV for our countries to have OOV in OOV for peace and to OOV human rights in the OOV region and to OOV OOV there an OOV public health and environmental problem that OOV OOV the OOV that they OOV to OOV .
This is a matter which , in any OOV , must be taken OOV and to its OOV , OOV of the OOV .
<P> Mr OOV , I thank you for your first OOV , not least because of the OOV of OOV that you OOV .
You were OOV of OOV at the time of the military OOV under question and you are now responsible for the implementation of the European Union ' s common OOV and security policy .
You are therefore in a position , if you like , to make an OOV contribution to the European Parliament 's OOV to find , together with the OOV of the Member States , OOV and other international organisations , the best OOV to this case at OOV , political or even military OOV .
That is what we hope for from the Council and from you .
<SPEAKER OOV OOV " NAME=" OOV > Madam President , ladies and gentlemen , in OOV , when I was OOV years OOV , a OOV OOV OOV the OOV world : in Europe , in our OOV , in OOV - they OOV without OOV as yet to OOV the OOV - and it was the OOV against OOV , the " OOV OOV .
It was the time of the OOV OOV by the OOV , by the OOV , by the OOV in OOV against the rights of the OOV .
The OOV OOV OOV , the OOV OOV OOV of you good OOV OOV of the OOV , OOV and OOV , OOV itself to OOV us that OOV , the " OOV OOV , was on the OOV OOV - this was before the OOV OOV in the OOV OOV - and was OOV OOV and OOV OOV to OOV the OOV , OOV society OOV the OOV OOV and his own people .
<P> OOV OOV , OOV OOV - for then you had the OOV OOV OOV at various OOV OOV , between OOV and OOV - a few OOV OOV here and there , would you OOV OOV us a OOV of OOV from your OOV OOV , from your OOV OOV to OOV OOV ?
You OOV very OOV .
OOV course the OOV OOV in the OOV OOV may not have been necessary and may have been OOV , but the OOV is that you do not OOV over this : you OOV will not OOV us OOV with your OOV OOV .
<P> OOV then , a European Parliament which is now OOV with a OOV OOV for such OOV is OOV , OOV , OOV and OOV : OOV in any case because it is OOV the OOV OOV for by OOV and OOV in OOV of need .
We cannot OOV to find out the OOV OOV about these OOV , but if they had been used to OOV OOV being OOV to the OOV as it was , we would have OOV the OOV of OOV , OOV of OOV of OOV , OOV , OOV and OOV in OOV .
<P> I therefore thank you , Madam President , and I OOV the OOV of the OOV which must be OOV in the OOV of our OOV to OOV and OOV it OOV <P> ( The President OOV the OOV OOV ) <SPEAKER OOV NAME=" OOV " > Madam President , we need to OOV the OOV in this case .
We have OOV certain OOV from Mr OOV but we know , and our OOV OOV in particular will OOV us of this , that it will be difficult for those OOV OOV have OOV of OOV to OOV that OOV OOV .
<P> These OOV we cannot OOV OOV OOV when better health and OOV OOV to have OOV us so OOV to OOV .
We now need to OOV Mr OOV 's OOV with OOV OOV OOV as OOV as possible and with the OOV OOV from the OOV authorities .
I have been OOV , particularly by my OOV OOV OOV , who OOV the area of OOV where OOV of these OOV has taken place , to OOV that the question as to the possible OOV upon the OOV OOV should be taken into account when this OOV is OOV out .
If he is going to OOV to this debate , Mr OOV might like to OOV that point .
<P> There were a OOV number of OOV OOV in the OOV OOV and , of course in the OOV , and as a OOV OOV I will say this : OOV course , we are concerned about the possible OOV of the use of depleted uranium , but against the OOV of Mr OOV 's OOV , we do not believe that OOV should OOV a OOV on the use of such OOV .
We have to OOV OOV OOV against OOV people .
OOV a OOV could place our OOV at a OOV OOV and OOV OOV OOV more OOV than the OOV OOV .
<P> As Mrs OOV has said : The real and OOV OOV in the OOV OOV from general environmental OOV following years of OOV , OOV and OOV .
This is what the European Union needs to OOV OOV we OOV very OOV the results of OOV OOV .
<P> In OOV OOV me say that Mr OOV 's contribution was very OOV of the OOV OOV of the OOV which OOV to OOV the European Union from the United States and would result in OOV Europe of any real OOV in the world .
<P> ( OOV from the right ) <SPEAKER OOV LANGUAGE="DE " NAME=" OOV " > Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , it is a quite OOV as well as a OOV debate that we are OOV here .
I am OOV OOV to OOV any OOV in a OOV about which OOV of OOV OOV is the better .
OOV yet that is what we are OOV today .
I have OOV taken any part in OOV about which OOV are OOV and which are OOV OOV .
That is not our subject today .
We have a different subject to OOV .
In the OOV , we have OOV said that , if it is necessary to use OOV OOV - and we have always agreed on this - we must ensure that our OOV has no more OOV than is OOV OOV and that it does the least possible OOV to the environment and to the health of those who OOV it .
<P> This , of course , is why we have OOV OOV and OOV OOV OOV , for example , and have always agreed that these OOV must OOV be used , because the OOV they OOV on the environment and on human health is out of all OOV to their military OOV .
If we are OOV today whether OOV OOV uranium do or do not OOV OOV , then I have no OOV to OOV OOV OOV us , not even OOV OOV , OOV I OOV respect , whether or not there is OOV OOV .
We are not OOV about OOV OOV , and when we OOV in this House about our own health and about OOV , we certainly all agreed that the OOV principle had to be OOV , even OOV we were OOV able to OOV that OOV OOV are the OOV of OOV OOV OOV .
<P> <P> We OOV OOV the OOV principle and put it to the vote , and we said that we must OOV particular OOV or OOV if there are OOV concerns about them , even if there is no OOV OOV .
We know today that there are OOV OOV of OOV .
OOV as long as the OOV are still OOV , as long as all of us do not know which of the OOV is OOV , we must agree that this OOV cannot be used OOV every last OOV of the issue has been OOV .
OOV OOV less than a OOV on this OOV would be an OOV decision for us to take today .
But in OOV to this we must also OOV for the people who OOV in the regions , for their health and the health of their OOV .
<P> ( OOV ) <SPEAKER OOV OOV " NAME=" OOV " > Mr President , I OOV a OOV OOV on OOV OOV this OOV which was OOV on behalf of the OOV OOV before the OOV OOV .
It OOV said that OOV which is OOV through the OOV of depleted uranium OOV a OOV if it OOV up OOV the OOV .
So the OOV involved were OOV OOV to the OOV OOV .
OOV the OOV aware of this before the OOV OOV and before the OOV , which , I OOV to OOV , I do not OOV ?
OOV the OOV and the military know ?
If so , why were OOV not given OOV in a OOV way ?
OOV are you now OOV today that the OOV did not have any OOV of OOV ?
OOV OOV OOV having been to the OOV , just as they did after the OOV OOV .
OOV OOV how many more will OOV OOV in those regions .
OOV will provide them with a OOV OOV OOV ?
The OOV on the use of depleted uranium will be the only OOV which can OOV OOV .
<P> <SPEAKER OOV NAME=" OOV " > Mr President , the OOV OOV from OOV in particular points clearly to a OOV increase in OOV of OOV where OOV OOV place during the OOV OOV and where OOV OOV of depleted uranium were used .
It is now OOV that the depleted uranium OOV were used by the OOV which OOV out OOV on the OOV of OOV and OOV during the OOV OOV .
<P> The people of the OOV are OOV to full and OOV OOV with regard to the OOV OOV of the depleted uranium OOV which were used during the OOV .
This Parliament and the European Union should , and must , be most OOV in OOV full OOV to these most important public health and human rights issues .
<P> On a OOV but OOV matter , I was quite OOV to OOV that depleted uranium OOV have been OOV into the OOV OOV by OOV OOV of OOV OOV at the OOV OOV between OOV and OOV and also at a OOV on the OOV OOV , just OOV OOV from a OOV OOV OOV .
This depleted uranium has been used in OOV up to OOV , and it is OOV that as many as OOV depleted uranium OOV have been OOV into the OOV OOV , which is an OOV of the OOV OOV .
<P> As a Member of the European Parliament , OOV OOV , which is OOV the OOV OOV , I am OOV concerned at these OOV .
I am OOV on the OOV government to make a full OOV on the matter .
I want to know whether there are any possible public health OOV from the use of depleted uranium OOV in the OOV to which I have OOV to today .
It is up to the OOV government to make a OOV on these OOV .
<SPEAKER OOV LANGUAGE="FR" NAME=" OOV " > Mr President , the OOV of the depleted uranium OOV is just the OOV OOV in the OOV OOV you have OOV against OOV .
Mr OOV , you are OOV OOV now that the OOV has OOV but you are two years too OOV .
OOV you take us for OOV ?
OOV you really think the United States will OOV you get OOV with this even OOV it has taken OOV years to see the OOV , the OOV and the OOV of the human OOV they OOV out on their own OOV on the OOV OOV following the OOV OOV OOV ?
<P> OOV we know , at any OOV , is that you have OOV OOV OOV to the OOV principle that people OOV OOV on about here .
OOV we know , as Commissioner OOV has just said , is that the OOV OOV of your OOV , Mr OOV , OOV the use of these OOV .
OOV we know is that the OOV of OOV OOV our OOV is OOV high .
If a OOV OOV were to be OOV , then you would be responsible for a OOV OOV , as the OOV made OOV only to military OOV , as if the uranium were OOV of OOV between military and OOV OOV .
<P> OOV OOV , ladies and gentlemen , if you want the OOV , then look for it OOV , and do not OOV Mr OOV , the European OOV OOV , to OOV Mr OOV , the OOV OOV OOV of OOV .
<SPEAKER OOV OOV " NAME=" OOV " > Mr President , today we are OOV an extremely important subject which OOV great OOV over extremely long OOV of time , and , OOV , we are OOV so on the basis of a OOV of OOV which , OOV as we are not OOV , is OOV to the OOV we are OOV to OOV out here .
<P> OOV regard to the OOV principle , to which OOV OOV have OOV , I am OOV concerned because , although we are OOV the issue of OOV , I do not OOV OOV would OOV OOV OOV that we should not OOV any OOV of OOV , even in the OOV of OOV OOV results .
<P> As the Commissioner , with OOV I am in OOV agreement , said just now , we must first OOV what the environmental situation in the region was , but we must also OOV , with great OOV of course , the OOV of OOV and OOV between the OOV used - the OOV - and the OOV on health .
I must , OOV , point out that depleted uranium is used in civil OOV in many other OOV , and we should certainly OOV these extremely OOV .
<P> We must also OOV in OOV the OOV of OOV OOV , where OOV OOV are adopted , OOV those who OOV OOV to the region and those who are OOV there by the Member States .
It is my view that we should OOV this issue extremely OOV and OOV that we certainly all have good OOV to be OOV to OOV for its OOV and future OOV .
We do not support the call for a OOV .
<SPEAKER OOV LANGUAGE="DE " NAME=" OOV > Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , we are OOV this debate today because of the concern we have for people .
OOV of these people are the military OOV , our OOV , who are there , but we are also concerned about the OOV OOV , the OOV who OOV in OOV and in OOV .
We do not OOV to OOV here and now whether the OOV in OOV was OOV or not .
It would be OOV to OOV in such a debate .
What we must do - and I OOV agree here with the OOV OOV of the OOV - is to OOV with the OOV OOV and OOV whether a OOV OOV between the OOV of OOV and the OOV of OOV with depleted uranium which were OOV during the OOV in OOV and OOV and in OOV too .
<P> If we OOV to do that , we must OOV OOV to certain important OOV , so that we at least , as OOV OOV of the OOV of Europe , can OOV the OOV which OOV has OOV through this and OOV OOV .
OOV priority OOV to OOV and OOV OOV by international OOV with the aid of every possible OOV OOV .
<P> OOV , we need a OOV change in our information policy , and in this respect I must thank the Council , and OOV all the OOV OOV of the OOV , for their OOV to make all information available to Parliament .
<P> OOV , and OOV , we must OOV an OOV OOV on all OOV and OOV of this OOV OOV we have the OOV results of the OOV we have OOV , so that we can then take our decisions in a responsible OOV .
<SPEAKER OOV OOV " NAME=" OOV > Mr President , to become OOV in a OOV debate , in which many see a OOV - and some do not - between the use of depleted uranium and an increase in the number of OOV , is every OOV ' s OOV .
There is the OOV that in this way , the political debate OOV over into a OOV one .
I believe we should OOV the OOV of the OOV , which is OOV , in my opinion .
<P> OOV of all , the European Union ' s responsibility is towards the local OOV .
It is up to the Member States to OOV responsibility for their OOV .
In my view , it should be the OOV s responsibility to look after the local OOV out there .
<P> The second responsibility we have is not to be OOV into OOV all OOV on the use of depleted uranium .
There might well be other OOV for the OOV number of OOV .
I therefore believe that a OOV OOV should be OOV into all the OOV which OOV OOV and in the national OOV .
<P> Finally , something which OOV me no end is that Mr OOV , as well as a number of OOV OOV , OOV a OOV OOV between the end and means to used to OOV the end , or the OOV between the OOV and the means OOV .
I was in favour of OOV in the OOV , but I am against taking OOV OOV .
<SPEAKER OOV LANGUAGE="FR" NAME=" OOV " > Mr President , the OOV OOV of the OOV OOV , and the OOV OOV for the military and OOV OOV that have been in OOV with the OOV of these in OOV , OOV and OOV , is a matter that we must approach OOV and OOV .
<P> We must be OOV , as has been said , for , OOV the OOV OOV , it has not been possible to OOV any clear OOV between the use of these OOV and the OOV of OOV that OOV to OOV following these military OOV , but also , you should be aware , during the long process of OOV and OOV these OOV .
<P> The OOV of OOV must , of course , be OOV .
We can therefore only welcome the OOV of OOV OOV at every level within our States , the OOV and the European Union .
However , the OOV OOV by the OOV of recent OOV must not OOV us down the OOV of what I would call OOV OOV " at the very time , Mrs OOV , when the European Union is OOV itself to OOV the OOV OOV of the OOV principle in order to OOV it being OOV OOV .
<P> OOV , the OOV OOV OOV in our various countries are the OOV best OOV of OOV OOV , since OOV OOV in OOV OOV have made the use of OOV OOV and OOV OOV OOV .
You should be aware that the development of new OOV will take many years .
<P> OOV this OOV can we OOV our OOV on the OOV of OOV OOV ?
I do not think so .
That is why I shall OOV the OOV for a OOV which has been OOV in point OOV of the OOV resolution when it is put to the vote before this House .
<P> I would OOV that the present debate does have one OOV : the fact that it OOV , if there were any need , that we must not OOV of a OOV OOV , something I have always OOV as not OOV an OOV but an OOV OOV .
OOV is always OOV because its OOV is to OOV human life .
It can only be OOV as a OOV OOV when every other means of OOV or OOV OOV on human OOV and OOV have OOV , and OOV , Mr OOV , that was the case in both OOV and OOV .
<P> <SPEAKER OOV OOV " NAME=" OOV > Mr President , we have a responsibility towards two parties : on the one hand , the young people who OOV part - OOV - in the military OOV in OOV and OOV and , of course , their OOV , and , on the other , the OOV of those OOV OOV , the OOV OOV .
<P> It is OOV , the OOV or OOV OOV between the use of depleted uranium OOV and the OOV of OOV , which are OOV , has not yet been OOV OOV , although the OOV OOV more than OOV , but these OOV OOV and are so OOV as to OOV the OOV concern .
It is therefore right to OOV , with a OOV approach , all the OOV OOV necessary to OOV the OOV of this OOV of OOV on health and the environment , but , in the OOV , it is also right to OOV the OOV principle , which has OOV been so appropriate as on this OOV , and that is why it is OOV and OOV to OOV a OOV .
<SPEAKER OOV LANGUAGE="DE " NAME=" OOV " > Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , OOV , and indeed OOV OOV , we OOV new information about OOV OOV .
That is why it is very OOV that Parliament is OOV with this issue today .
I thank the OOV OOV for OOV us OOV information and OOV .
For us too , it is a new OOV to be OOV OOV of security and OOV policy in this way .
It will certainly OOV European security and OOV policy to be OOV OOV the OOV that OOV in the Member States , where OOV and OOV are OOV OOV to OOV political points on these issues .
In OOV , for example , the OOV OOV Government under their OOV of OOV has been OOV all these OOV , which is something that has certainly not been OOV here in Parliament .
<P> We in the European Parliament have an opportunity to OOV OOV OOV and information , and that is a very good OOV .
What is OOV - and it has been a OOV of this debate too - are OOV OOV about the OOV OOV and the OOV in OOV .
Mr OOV , if you OOV the OOV of OOV Rights and our high European OOV in this OOV , I must OOV you that , at the time when OOV European OOV were at OOV , when OOV OOV , OOV and OOV were the order of the OOV in the OOV , your political OOV OOV OOV on the OOV .
This also has to be said in such a debate .
<P> We are OOV for OOV information to be OOV , for the information available in the Member States to be OOV at the European level with OOV OOV through the OOV OOV of the United OOV and OOV to Parliament again .
OOV OOV conflict must always be OOV by the OOV that no more OOV may be used than is necessary to achieve the military OOV .
For this reason we need information and OOV on OOV systems which are less OOV than the one we have been OOV today .
This is where the European Parliament can OOV its responsibility in the framework of European security and OOV policy by making its own OOV OOV .
<SPEAKER OOV OOV " > Mr President , OOV , the OOV which you had for action in OOV was not a OOV to use OOV which the OOV of OOV OOV and OOV and the OOV OOV of which , as OOV now , was OOV to military OOV at the time .
<P> If now that OOV have OOV and more will OOV , you feel OOV by this fact , to OOV OOV in this Parliament that is , I am OOV to say , OOV of OOV and OOV OOV .
<P> Mr President , we are OOV about the OOV of these OOV in the OOV , we are OOV about the OOV who OOV part and we are OOV about the OOV of the areas which OOV OOV .
We call for a OOV environmental OOV into any OOV in the environment OOV the OOV .
OOV concern has OOV OOV which you cannot OOV to OOV here in the House , at least OOV public opinion in my country .
<P> The OOV OOV for a resolution also OOV for a OOV OOV <P> ( The President OOV the OOV OOV ) ( OOV ) <SPEAKER OOV OOV NAME=" OOV " > Mr President , just three points , because a great deal has already been said .
<P> OOV : I should like to say to Mr OOV that when , in OOV , we and some of our OOV OOV OOV to find out if depleted uranium was being used in OOV , there was a OOV and Mrs OOV - I have the OOV here - said in OOV to a question that there was still no OOV that depleted uranium was used in the conflict .
That is what it OOV in the OOV report .
<P> OOV : depleted uranium is a OOV and OOV OOV , especially when used in OOV because on OOV it OOV , OOV uranium OOV and OOV into a OOV which can be OOV and the uranium OOV is OOV OOV and can get into the OOV and OOV OOV .
OOV - and you must know that there is no OOV OOV which does not actually OOV OOV , even in small OOV - an OOV OOV OOV is OOV both in the OOV and in OOV and , of course , in OOV , although any results there , if they do OOV , will not do so OOV a OOV OOV .
<P> OOV : if we OOV , and you Mr OOV OOV , that this OOV is OOV , in OOV , to OOV the OOV , should the OOV principle not OOV ?
If OOV OOV to me , or to OOV for that matter , look , we need to OOV out a OOV because your OOV may OOV , am I going to OOV OOV OOV the OOV is OOV out or am I going to get out and OOV for the results ?
It OOV to reason and I do not OOV that depleted uranium is the only OOV at OOV 's OOV ; it has a OOV of other OOV OOV in its OOV .
<P> <SPEAKER OOV NAME=" OOV " > Mr President , we here have now been OOV from various OOV that information will be given and OOV OOV OOV .
OOV now that OOV has been OOV .
OOV we must have the right information to support our action , but I have the same OOV as have been OOV here with regard to OOV the OOV principle into OOV .
We have as our next point for OOV the issue of a OOV OOV OOV .
In this OOV we clearly have to OOV a position on our approach to the matter of people ' s health , although we might not see a OOV OOV , for OOV , with OOV .
It is very possible that other OOV OOV , for example in OOV with OOV OOV , will be OOV in the long OOV .
OOV we really work on the basis that when we do good and OOV OOV , at the same time we will be OOV the OOV OOV so much OOV and OOV in the future ?
<SPEAKER OOV NAME=" OOV " > Mr President , I find it OOV OOV to OOV about the OOV principle in OOV to OOV , which are after all OOV to be OOV for your health .
The problem , of course , is that you only have to OOV the OOV OOV " and there is an OOV of what can only be OOV as OOV OOV .
<P> OOV course , the OOV and OOV must be OOV and I welcome the action taken by OOV OOV OOV to that end , but we have to make a OOV on the OOV and the OOV are very clear at the OOV .
There is no OOV between depleted uranium and the OOV .
If we look at the OOV of OOV OOV OOV that was done in the United States and OOV that with the OOV of the OOV group , there is no OOV in the OOV OOV , or OOV OOV , or the OOV of OOV between the two OOV .
We must ensure that we are working on the basis of OOV fact and that is why it is not appropriate to call for a OOV at the OOV , when there is no OOV OOV between the two .
<P> There are a OOV of other issues to do with the OOV OOV which we should be OOV , like OOV OOV OOV and the environmental OOV which the Commission has OOV , but OOV us OOV to the OOV .
<SPEAKER OOV LANGUAGE="ES " NAME=" OOV " > Mr President , I would OOV like to thank all the Members who have OOV , since the way they have OOV and their OOV clearly OOV that we all OOV the same wish for OOV on this situation .
The OOV concern we all must have is OOV for the people who are OOV OOV and those who may become OOV and OOV in the future .
I therefore once again OOV to provide all the information I can .
What you cannot ask me to do is to provide information when I am OOV to do so or when I have no information .
<P> This is an issue which by its very OOV OOV within the OOV of national OOV and we are OOV therefore OOV on the information OOV by the OOV OOV .
As I said in my OOV OOV , I am in OOV with the OOV and organisations working on this issue and once again I can OOV you that the Council and I OOV will make available all the information we have with the OOV of OOV .
It would be rather difficult to provide you with information we do not have .
<P> OOV , I would like to say that , as some of you have OOV out , we must OOV all the OOV open in the OOV OOV .
We must not OOV on certain OOV and OOV OOV which may have OOV which are OOV OOV to health .
I am therefore OOV to have OOV both the Commission and some of the Members who have OOV OOV a OOV to OOV all the OOV which may have an environmental OOV .
I can OOV you that I , too , am a OOV , a OOV , by OOV .
I am not going to OOV you with all I OOV at the time , even if I could OOV much of it , but I do think it important for us to OOV a OOV OOV to this problem and to OOV to OOV all the available information before OOV the full OOV .
OOV now , OOV should have any OOV but that all the countries and all the international organisations are OOV their OOV to find a OOV to this problem , OOV together the most OOV information as OOV as possible .
<P> A great many things have been said , all very OOV .
I have taken OOV of OOV , but I do not want to go through each point OOV since not many OOV OOV have been OOV .
I would , however , like to OOV to some of the OOV that have been made in order to OOV any OOV .
OOV me , in all OOV and OOV , OOV that I OOV the OOV from the OOV of the Group of the OOV OOV OOV and - as they themselves know , because I OOV to them - I OOV the OOV and made the OOV available to the OOV of Government and OOV of the Union .
The OOV was OOV OOV and not in OOV , but you are aware that the decision which the OOV OOV was to continue OOV the OOV they had already OOV in OOV , which was the time I actually OOV the OOV .
So , OOV do not think that no one OOV any attention to the OOV I OOV .
The OOV was taken into OOV , but the OOV still OOV upon a course other than that OOV in the OOV .
OOV from any of the OOV of political OOV in this Parliament are always taken into OOV , and I would like you to be OOV of that .
<P> I have two OOV which are OOV OOV OOV .
OOV , I make a very clear OOV between OOV and means .
I would not like to be OOV of OOV the OOV with the means .
I am OOV OOV of OOV between OOV and means and I know very well that OOV are the important OOV and that OOV the OOV OOV very much on the means OOV .
OOV means , and our OOV of them , change over time .
There are OOV when the information available OOV that particular means may be OOV or may have OOV to be OOV , and in OOV these OOV we have to take account of the information available at the OOV time when decisions are taken .
I would therefore like to make it clear that that I am not OOV OOV with means .
I have OOV done so and I would hope OOV to do so .
<P> I would like to say something to those who OOV me of having OOV this Parliament for its OOV .
In no way am I OOV Parliament for its OOV , not now , not OOV .
You OOV the will of the people of the European Union and you are responsible for your own OOV .
What I have , and what I believe I must OOV with you , are the OOV when we have agreed years or OOV OOV .
That does not OOV I am OOV Parliament or making it OOV .
If I say it once or if I say it a OOV OOV , I fully OOV my OOV , I always have and I always will , that is my OOV , without the need to make OOV OOV .
What I need to do is to ask you to OOV your own responsibility .
I am OOV OOV and you must OOV OOV .
OOV we cannot OOV that the OOV adopted by this Parliament OOV me OOV for OOV .
OOV OOV were important to me when I OOV the Council of OOV of the European Union and also to the OOV of State and Government of the European Union .
That is not making OOV OOV .
That is OOV responsibility like the responsible OOV all of us are here .
We must be able to OOV and to OOV our OOV responsibility .
<P> I have OOV OOV to say .
I would like to thank you and also to OOV you that I shall be OOV back here on OOV OOV for a debate on the OOV OOV , but I shall OOV at your OOV during the OOV OOV to continue OOV this very important issue since it is one in which we have a OOV at OOV , OOV our OOV and also our OOV to continue to make progress in the area of European Union OOV management .
In this respect , ladies and gentlemen , OOV be OOV that you can OOV on me , at least on my good will .
That you can OOV on my OOV is not so certain .
<P> <SPEAKER OOV NAME=" OOV " > Mr President , I also want to start by OOV thank you to all the Members of the European Parliament for their OOV , because they have OOV the need to take OOV the OOV and OOV in respect of all those who OOV from OOV and OOV as well as the need to OOV all available information and to OOV also the OOV health OOV .
<P> The Commission , I OOV you , will do all in its OOV and OOV to OOV a OOV OOV basis in OOV to this issue and we will also , of course , OOV fully with other national and international OOV working in this field : OOV , OOV , OOV and the OOV OOV OOV .
<P> The Commission 's efforts will be OOV into our OOV programme of support in the OOV with respect to health and the environment , because we must look at the OOV OOV .
We also welcome the opportunity to report back to the European Parliament on the progress of our efforts to OOV a OOV OOV basis on the OOV of depleted uranium .
We would like to come back to report to you and of course we are always OOV to OOV any OOV that you might have .
<SPEAKER OOV LANGUAGE="SV" OOV " > Mr President , I just want to take the opportunity of OOV Commissioner OOV and OOV to OOV in their OOV OOV OOV here in the OOV - in Mrs OOV ' s case , Swedish .
<SPEAKER OOV NAME=" President " > OOV you very much , Mrs OOV .
The OOV of OOV Rights OOV that the European Union is a OOV of OOV countries , and OOV is OOV to OOV in OOV OOV he or OOV OOV .
<P> <SPEAKER OOV NAME=" OOV " > Mr President , on a point of order .
I have just been OOV at the OOV of the OOV OOV for a resolution .
I should like to point out that the OOV OOV as OOV for the OOV Group , the OOV OOV , is most welcome to OOV our Group .
I should like to place on the OOV how OOV we are to have a new OOV today who OOV on our behalf .
<SPEAKER OOV NAME=" President " > OOV , by the time of the vote we shall have OOV which OOV OOV OOV does and does not OOV to .
<P> I should like to OOV the House that I have OOV OOV OOV for OOV under OOV OOV OOV ) of the OOV of OOV as well as one OOV OOV for a resolution OOV by OOV OOV .
<P> The debate is OOV .
<P> The vote will take place at OOV OOV OOV .
<SPEAKER OOV OOV OOV " > Mr President , on a point of order .
OOV we could just OOV that point of order now .
OOV OOV is , and OOV , OOV a OOV of the OOV OOV Group .
<SPEAKER OOV NAME=" President " > Mr OOV OOV , I cannot OOV you to make OOV on behalf of OOV OOV OOV you have OOV OOV from OOV .
<SPEAKER OOV LANGUAGE="FR" NAME=" OOV " > Mr President , since we are OOV the OOV resolution on the OOV OOV , I would just like to point out that my own OOV and that of my group have been OOV OOV on this OOV resolution .
<SPEAKER OOV NAME=" President " > Mr OOV , I OOV said a OOV OOV for a resolution OOV by OOV OOV , not OOV .
I am OOV OOV with the OOV of your group on this point , which is why I OOV it quite OOV .
OOV OOV OOV OOV OOV <SPEAKER OOV NAME=" President " > The next OOV is the report ( OOV ) by Mr OOV OOV , on behalf of the Committee on OOV OOV , OOV Rights , OOV OOV and OOV OOV , on the proposal for a Council OOV OOV ) OOV - OOV - OOV OOV on the OOV of a OOV OOV OOV .
<SPEAKER OOV NAME=" OOV OOV " > Mr President , this proposal is about OOV for an OOV , OOV OOV by the Union to OOV .
It is first OOV - for those who OOV Union OOV - and is OOV by the Commission .
It is not a military , OOV OOV OOV , which is , of course , second OOV , and OOV by the Council of OOV .
<P> However , I have been OOV , OOV and OOV how I am going to OOV the Committee on OOV OOV , OOV Rights , OOV OOV and OOV OOV 's OOV , OOV and OOV .
I have been OOV whether we are going to use OOV OOV in OOV and to OOV a OOV of OOV OOV .
I want to make it OOV clear that this is OOV to do with the military OOV OOV OOV : this is a financial OOV for the Commission to OOV to OOV very OOV .
<P> OOV the Commission will OOV the OOV as OOV as is necessary , Parliament OOV OOV as one OOV of the OOV OOV .
We shall vote the OOV and we shall look forward to the reports from the Commission on how it has OOV the OOV .
We OOV the Commission to OOV the OOV on OOV to OOV by OOV OOV , OOV OOV or OOV , OOV OOV to OOV the OOV , OOV or OOV - OOV is OOV - to the OOV , OOV it is - not OOV within Europe .
<P> In the OOV the Union has been OOV OOV for being OOV in OOV to OOV .
We have OOV to OOV an OOV OOV when it was most OOV OOV , and this proposal is part of Commissioner OOV 's OOV efforts to improve the Union 's aid programme , which is in a OOV of a OOV , to say the least .
<P> I hope very much that Parliament will support it , and I will come back to that .
We would be very OOV to know whether , when the Commissioner OOV to this debate , he would be able to OOV the OOV of OOV that he OOV this may be used for - although , of course , we have some OOV OOV .
<P> I have been OOV by a number of OOV who have OOV the report why , if it is such a good OOV , there are so many amendments in it .
The OOV Commission proposal was OOV OOV last year , but after that OOV OOV .
It was OOV , it OOV , by the OOV Presidency , with no OOV of what was OOV .
So I OOV a question at OOV OOV OOV for an OOV and OOV - but OOV there was no OOV - the OOV Presidency and the Commission OOV together to OOV to OOV the OOV .
They OOV up with an OOV OOV but , I am OOV to say , the Council has OOV had the OOV to OOV Parliament of the new OOV of the OOV .
So the many amendments in my report are an OOV to OOV the OOV proposal and for us to OOV on the new OOV OOV which we OOV to OOV , even OOV it was OOV given to us OOV .
<P> Parliament has only one OOV on this , which is another OOV which was not OOV at the OOV OOV of the OOV OOV .
It should , of course , be OOV , but it is not .
However , we were able to OOV to use our OOV OOV to OOV it - like the OOV OOV case some years OOV - and if we OOV an opinion , OOV further can OOV .
So we have an OOV OOV .
<P> But , OOV , the committee in Parliament has OOV at this proposal in great OOV and is in favour of it .
OOV the many amendments OOV by the committee .
<P> Finally - I am not going to go into the OOV of the amendments - I am OOV to say that the committee adopted the amendments OOV OOV , with the OOV OOV of the OOV OOV .
They will no OOV OOV why that was so .
That was the OOV which I OOV OOV to OOV because it had become OOV OOV about Europe .
I very much hope that when we vote on this proposal they will at last feel positive and give it their OOV support .
<SPEAKER OOV NAME=" OOV > Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , the Committee on OOV OOV the OOV OOV OOV OOV .
We support this Community OOV , which is OOV to make resources available for OOV OOV OOV OOV to OOV management and conflict OOV .
It is right and OOV that the European Union should help to OOV or OOV public order and to OOV OOV , OOV , OOV and the OOV of human rights OOV .
<P> OOV of this , however , can only be OOV or become OOV if the OOV really is able to OOV OOV .
That is why we OOV support the Commission 's proposal that implementation be OOV on the committee system , including the OOV of an OOV committee , with the OOV on the OOV OOV ' .
<P> OOV over the years , as you know , the Commission - with OOV OOV , I OOV to OOV - has been OOV a OOV of OOV OOV OOV from the OOV of the common OOV and security policy , in other words from the second OOV of the European OOV process , to that of the Community , the first OOV .
This OOV is OOV by the current proposal for the OOV OOV OOV .
So far , so good .
But the funds for this OOV must be OOV under OOV OOV of the OOV OOV .
OOV all Members of this House have been made aware by at least the last two OOV OOV just how OOV our OOV are in the OOV OOV .
OOV year , this OOV has been the subject of our OOV OOV OOV with the Council .
We have no need of a OOV OOV to OOV a OOV situation this year .
<P> For that reason we have OOV the OOV committee to do two things : OOV , to call on the Commission and Council to OOV their OOV and particularly to OOV how they OOV to OOV up OOV between themselves in this field and how they OOV to OOV the OOV OOV , and , OOV , to OOV a OOV to the OOV OOV OOV quite clearly that OOV OOV OOV must be OOV within OOV OOV . OOV that be OOV , OOV must be made for a OOV of the OOV OOV .
In OOV , we want an OOV to OOV Parliament on each action to be OOV under the OOV .
The rapporteur and the OOV committee have OOV with these OOV OOV .
For this we are very OOV to them .
<SPEAKER OOV OOV " NAME=" OOV " > Mr President , the European Commission OOV a whole OOV of OOV which are important in terms of a civil contribution to OOV those OOV under OOV which OOV to get out of hand .
OOV OOV can be OOV in the OOV OOV following a OOV conflict , to OOV the situation from OOV OOV point again .
In OOV to the OOV aid OOV , these OOV also OOV OOV , the OOV of government OOV , OOV and OOV .
They OOV into OOV and aid policy OOV OOV to OOV OOV to a certain region .
<P> We very much welcome the OOV of political and OOV OOV in all these civil OOV in the form of a OOV OOV OOV .
In this way , the OOV s responsibility for the international legal order can be OOV much more OOV .
OOV , it OOV the Commission and the OOV Commissioner a OOV to OOV forward their own OOV and proposals in this field .
<P> In our opinion , the OOV between the rapporteur and the Commission has OOV to an excellent resolution .
OOV efforts have been made to OOV OOV or OOV OOV OOV which OOV the OOV process .
The rapporteur is right to point out the need for OOV this OOV and the need for a OOV OOV for financial management and implementation .
<P> OOV group OOV the Commission OOV to the rapporteur ' s amendments on a number of OOV .
For OOV , I find the OOV of OOV and OOV in OOV OOV ( OOV ) , which is what the OOV OOV OOV will OOV to achieve , very OOV .
<P> The report OOV the clear OOV of the European Parliament in the policy .
OOV the OOV OOV of the Member States , also in the future , the report is right to call for a system of information OOV .
OOV OOV whether more OOV OOV and OOV will be possible in the time to come .
<P> We OOV from our OOV , OOV with some OOV .
OOV and OOV are important OOV where a great deal OOV OOV and , OOV but OOV , we OOV from our OOV .
The OOV OOV OOV is , as far as this is concerned , an OOV OOV forward .
We hope , of course , that it will need to be OOV as OOV as possible , but that is OOV OOV .
We know that in OOV , it is OOV to have this OOV up your OOV , as a OOV to the OOV OOV military OOV which OOV within the OOV of Mr OOV .
<P> We think that in future , the European Union ' s civil OOV will matter most in the OOV of OOV law and order , and this is , of course , also what we want .
For we too , like OOV OOV , would like to OOV civil OOV over military OOV , but we need not OOV this point too much in this OOV , given the OOV OOV of OOV OOV the need OOV to OOV military OOV .
<SPEAKER OOV OOV " NAME=" OOV > Mr President , I would like to start by OOV Mr OOV OOV , who OOV us so OOV through this OOV OOV of the report in the Committee on OOV OOV , OOV Rights , OOV and OOV , and has done so again .
OOV way of example and OOV , I can OOV that only one OOV was OOV for the OOV with regard to his report .
OOV group will , OOV , support that OOV .
<P> The proposal to OOV a OOV OOV OOV by means of which financial resources can be OOV up OOV , OOV the OOV support of my group .
It is our OOV OOV to OOV civil OOV first in the OOV of a OOV conflict situation .
This is the second OOV OOV in that OOV , after OOV the OOV of a OOV OOV OOV OOV .
We are OOV with OOV OOV for a OOV proposal for a OOV OOV with OOV OOV OOV " in this area .
<P> We would like to see a OOV OOV between the EU efforts in the OOV of civil and military OOV management .
The EU must be able to OOV OOV in OOV OOV with a OOV and OOV OOV of OOV at its OOV .
This is why OOV OOV are being OOV for the OOV OOV OOV .
OOV can be OOV by OOV within the Community framework .
However , in OOV this OOV the number of countries where the OOV can be OOV , but we do not OOV any OOV problems .
OOV is the European Union not OOV ?
<P> In OOV where the Commission OOV a OOV proposal - which is OOV - to OOV the OOV so as to OOV the implementation of EU programmes , we would like to see the OOV OOV policy ' OOV .
This will OOV the OOV .
<P> In order not to OOV OOV , we have OOV not OOV the financial OOV OOV , or including OOV in the OOV .
The OOV OOV OOV must be OOV by OOV .
<P> We would ask the Commission , especially in the OOV , to OOV out many and OOV OOV , and to report on these to our Parliament .
In this OOV , we are also very OOV to find out how the OOV will OOV to the OOV programme .
This is a new OOV , and we can OOV from its OOV OOV .
<P> Finally , I should like to ask whether the Commissioner would be OOV to OOV possible OOV for OOV at some point in the future , for we are now OOV about OOV , but we must also OOV about the OOV OOV at some OOV , and for this OOV , a OOV OOV would , I believe , be very OOV .
<SPEAKER OOV OOV " OOV OOV OOV " > Mr President , when things go OOV in a certain region , the world has come to OOV OOV more from Europe , and OOV so .
We have the means , the OOV OOV and OOV to help in OOV OOV , and from that point of view , OOV can OOV OOV OOV from OOV under OOV .
<P> That is why I welcome the Commission proposal to set up a OOV OOV OOV OOV the military OOV and to OOV OOV .
This new OOV will certainly OOV a need , so much so that OOV could OOV OOV OOV .
In my opinion , the resources available for this year are an OOV to the serious OOV of the OOV .
OOV if the OOV is OOV or OOV in OOV years , it OOV a OOV OOV to the many OOV which can OOV for OOV action .
It is about OOV OOV , OOV and OOV .
The OOV OOV of OOV from the OOV excellent OOV OOV report OOV , therefore , as a OOV of a OOV .
It OOV many important OOV of a not OOV OOV OOV , such as OOV education , OOV OOV or OOV OOV .
OOV the Commissioner OOV what , OOV to OOV , the OOV of OOV will need to be , also in the OOV of OOV financial resources ?
<P> The OOV initiative , a first OOV OOV under the OOV of the Commission , OOV to me .
It is of OOV importance for our Parliament to be OOV involved .
OOV we be OOV about OOV action in good time ?
We often OOV about issues of OOV and OOV between Mr OOV and Mr OOV ; a OOV of OOV between the OOV and the Commission in terms of military and civil OOV is very much an OOV on OOV , but could well OOV to major problems in OOV .
OOV the Commissioner give us any OOV in this respect ?
European OOV , military and OOV action must be OOV OOV .
This is another OOV which the world has of us , and OOV so .
<SPEAKER OOV LANGUAGE="DE " NAME=" OOV " > Mr President , OOV since OOV the Union has been OOV OOV its role as a OOV OOV for OOV in Europe .
The only problem is that it does not even OOV OOV with which to OOV OOV .
OOV the OOV OOV OOV , the Union has now OOV some OOV at least , and I do welcome that .
However , I should have OOV to see this OOV OOV OOV itself with OOV too , but Members of this House are OOV those who have OOV us that , OOV this OOV does not OOV all our needs , OOV OOV are OOV OOV OOV .
OOV , the OOV is a OOV forward , but I must OOV that it is still a OOV OOV , because it only funds action after the OOV .
OOV greater importance OOV OOV to action before the OOV , to OOV measures .
OOV OOV OOV cannot OOV OOV , which is why we also OOV OOV to be OOV for the European OOV peace OOV that Parliament OOV for in its resolution of OOV , and we ask OOV OOV to OOV these things more OOV .
<SPEAKER OOV LANGUAGE="ES " NAME=" OOV OOV " > Mr President , I would OOV like to OOV Mr OOV OOV on his report and for the OOV with which the committee has taken on OOV all OOV of OOV .
We consider the Commission ' s initiative to be an important one .
OOV , I must point out that , although in our Group , the OOV Group of the European United OOV OOV OOV , there is , OOV , no OOV point of view on this issue , the OOV of us are in favour of this OOV OOV OOV .
We believe that it is important , that it must be OOV as a European Community policy , and that greater OOV must be OOV on conflict OOV as part of Europe ' s contribution to peace .
<P> We would therefore have OOV to have OOV greater OOV OOV , and better OOV between the various OOV programmes to improve their OOV , as well as greater OOV when it OOV to the OOV - and OOV , OOV , necessary - military OOV , which would OOV not become necessary if the OOV OOV were OOV out OOV .
<SPEAKER OOV OOV " NAME=" OOV " > Mr President , the OOV on the OOV OOV OOV is OOV to OOV .
Member States are still not agreed on the OOV and OOV of this OOV .
OOV , it will also be some time before agreement is OOV , and that OOV the financial OOV for the Member States are OOV .
There is no need for them to increase their OOV to the Union ' s OOV policy , they only need to OOV OOV to OOV the OOV of OOV resources .
OOV negotiations have once again OOV that OOV OOV OOV one of the Union ' s OOV OOV OOV in OOV because of the OOV OOV OOV by the national Member States .
<P> OOV the OOV OOV of programmes OOV by the Union is not a OOV for the European Union to OOV OOV in the world at will .
I therefore OOV the OOV which have been OOV to the report of the Committee on OOV OOV , OOV Rights , OOV and OOV OOV with regard to this proposal .
This OOV OOV OOV on OOV within the OOV of European programmes .
This OOV can provide help where the implementation of those programmes is at OOV OOV to OOV OOV .
<P> However , I do not OOV the OOV of the report on a different OOV .
OOV , OOV the rapporteur , I wish to OOV the OOV committee from the Commission proposal .
In this way , we will OOV a situation from OOV where OOV OOV with OOV OOV within Member States .
OOV , we will OOV the Union ' s and Member States ' OOV the necessary OOV .
OOV OOV , in the OOV of all the OOV which the Union ' s OOV action has had to put up with over the years .
<P> I also have my OOV about the OOV made in the OOV OOV with regard to the OOV of the legal basis of this OOV .
OOV OOV is the only OOV on which this proposal can be OOV .
OOV , I OOV whether the OOV of OOV OOV will OOV the OOV of this OOV .
It OOV to me that OOV for Parliament will OOV OOV OOV .
What we do need to be able to do is to call the Commission to account OOV on the use of this OOV .
<SPEAKER OOV LANGUAGE="DE " NAME=" OOV " > Mr President , the proposal for a OOV OOV a OOV OOV OOV is one of those which are OOV on OOV OOV OOV but which are OOV to OOV as a result of OOV OOV and OOV OOV .
The European Union has OOV a rather OOV role OOV in the OOV of OOV OOV and conflict resolution .
The reason for this does not OOV to OOV so much in a OOV of OOV or financial OOV as in a OOV to OOV , plan and OOV OOV and OOV .
OOV that as it may , the OOV of OOV to become more OOV in the resolution of OOV and in OOV management must be OOV as an important OOV in the right OOV .
The EU has OOV done OOV things to improve the situation in OOV areas , especially with financial resources .
But OOV is no OOV for political will and political OOV .
If the EU OOV to OOV a more OOV role in future , it must have the political will to OOV itself more OOV in the implementation of appropriate measures .
<P> I am only the OOV of a small country , but I can OOV you that OOV , with its long OOV of OOV and OOV , has OOV a particular OOV of OOV in the OOV of political OOV and OOV management , which OOV parties to a conflict more OOV to OOV it as a OOV .
OOV this is one of the very areas in which the EU should be making greater use of the OOV of its OOV countries .
OOV management and OOV OOV are not so much about OOV financial resources and OOV OOV organisations as about the OOV that OOV parties are OOV to place in an OOV of OOV .
OOV this is OOV where the EU has been OOV .
<P> We have an OOV problem in the OOV of the parties to the OOV OOV in the world today .
That cannot be OOV with new OOV OOV and financial OOV OOV .
What is really OOV is a OOV OOV to OOV greater OOV responsibility in the OOV of OOV and OOV management .
<SPEAKER OOV OOV OOV " > Mr President , I hope I have the Commissioner 's attention , as he is in OOV with Mr OOV at the OOV .
OOV this Parliament we have been OOV for the Commission to OOV more OOV financial management and OOV OOV so that it can OOV OOV OOV and OOV its programmes such as OOV action OOV , in OOV of OOV or when OOV are at OOV .
It OOV to us that this was the OOV OOV OOV Mr OOV 's proposal for the OOV OOV OOV .
I hope this is the case and I would ask for a OOV on this point from the Commissioner .
<P> It is a OOV that the OOV " OOV OOV OOV " has been used for what after all should be a OOV matter , a financial management OOV .
It is OOV OOV with " OOV OOV OOV " ; it has been OOV in the OOV and even in Parliament 's own OOV OOV this OOV .
OOV in the interest of OOV and to OOV OOV , the Commission could change the OOV to something like " OOV OOV OOV .
<P> We support the principle as I have OOV it , but one or two OOV OOV OOV to have OOV in .
OOV , OOV of OOV to the OOV in the OOV of OOV and the Commission 's own first OOV OOV OOV , it has been put into the OOV of the common security and OOV policy .
OOV we have OOV our concerns about the EU OOV in military OOV on many OOV and our OOV have not been OOV by OOV at OOV .
This is a OOV issue .
The Commission 's financial OOV should not be OOV up with these OOV issues .
<P> OOV , there is a OOV of political OOV OOV through the proposal .
I am OOV for OOV by the OOV that the OOV against OOV OOV would OOV into the OOV management OOV , OOV the use of the OOV OOV OOV .
<P> OOV , for us more OOV , Mr OOV OOV , the rapporteur , has taken the opportunity to OOV an OOV in OOV of one of his OOV OOV , OOV the OOV of a European public security OOV , in other words a European OOV or OOV OOV .
This is the main reason why we cannot OOV this report .
<P> We do not want a European OOV and we certainly to not want a European OOV OOV .
We do want the Commission to OOV out its OOV OOV with greater OOV and we welcome measures to that OOV .
<SPEAKER OOV OOV " NAME=" OOV > Mr President , the European Parliament has always OOV the need to increase the European Union ' s OOV OOV OOV .
We therefore welcome the Council ' s proposal and support Mr OOV OOV s report , which OOV forward proposals that improve the OOV .
These are clearly issues which come under the first OOV .
OOV , we all know that , in the OOV of the second OOV , the military OOV of a OOV OOV OOV , OOV to OOV OOV OOV , is being OOV .
It is OOV that these OOV will be OOV out in third countries where the OOV OOV OOV OOV will also OOV .
But how , and in what OOV ?
What OOV of OOV will this OOV OOV ?
What OOV of OOV ?
I therefore think it would have been OOV for the OOV to have OOV this OOV as well .
As a Member of this Parliament , I wish to OOV to the OOV down of some of the OOV that OOV OOV of OOV from one another so that greater cooperation within the European Union is OOV .
<SPEAKER OOV NAME=" OOV " > Mr President , my OOV fully OOV the need for the OOV countries to make available resources for international OOV and for our OOV to be OOV and OOV .
In this OOV , the Commission 's proposal OOV OOV in that it OOV the OOV for OOV a OOV to OOV OOV .
<P> However , we believe that for our efforts to be both OOV and OOV , they should be OOV , OOV and OOV on a OOV international OOV , OOV the resources and the OOV of the whole OOV world , including the OOV OOV and the good will of the United States .
<P> The OOV for OOV this already OOV in the form of the United OOV and its various OOV .
OOV OOV and always OOV of OOV , these OOV have OOV good OOV and have OOV much OOV .
For the future , the way to ensure that OOV are OOV is to continue working through these OOV , OOV that resources are used OOV and OOV .
As far as the Commission 's proposal is concerned , this is OOV OOV the OOV , OOV the political OOV of the European Union before the needs of OOV people .
<P> OOV in OOV need a European OOV OOV OOV as much as a OOV needs a OOV .
We should OOV these OOV OOV and OOV support and OOV the OOV OOV which have a better OOV OOV that the EU will OOV have .
<SPEAKER OOV NAME=" OOV " > Mr President , in OOV this matter I very much welcome the proposal from the Swedish OOV OOV that I have just OOV today for a OOV action plan for conflict OOV , because as I have said before , we in the European Union should be OOV a OOV for peace to areas of conflict and not just OOV .
<P> The European Union is the best example in the OOV of the world of conflict resolution and that is something we OOV to OOV .
OOV at the last OOV : the first OOV of it was OOV by the OOV conflict the world had OOV OOV : two world OOV and OOV of people OOV and OOV .
OOV who could have OOV that in the second OOV of that OOV those same people would come together in the European Union .
<P> As I know from my own OOV , the OOV at the OOV of European Union will OOV conflict OOV they are OOV in the world .
OOV do you not think it is a very positive and OOV OOV for the European Union to have a OOV that does OOV that ?
In other words , the Commission should have a OOV of peace and OOV and a Commissioner for peace and OOV to go to areas of conflict in OOV and OOV the OOV of conflict resolution , particularly those OOV at the OOV of European Union itself .
<SPEAKER OOV NAME=" OOV " > Mr President , I am very OOV to have OOV in the debate OOV from my own region in the OOV from different parties say that they will be OOV this report .
I am OOV to support the OOV OOV OOV and I do so as a Member of Parliament 's OOV Committee .
<P> In the OOV that OOV people OOV OOV after the OOV in OOV OOV , this European Union must be able to OOV more OOV just as we OOV to do in OOV to the OOV of OOV OOV in that same country back in OOV .
I ask Commissioner OOV in OOV the debate , first to OOV us that the OOV will be OOV in OOV to OOV OOV in support of the EU 's development OOV and not just in Europe 's own OOV .
<P> OOV , could he OOV us how he could make such a OOV when year after year the Commission OOV OOV OOV in OOV and OOV Europe and in the OOV OOV at the OOV of OOV OOV OOV the OOV countries .
<P> OOV , will he OOV to OOV forward a OOV OOV OOV between the OOV OOV OOV and the OOV of OOV and indeed OOV why he has not at one and the same time OOV forward proposals to OOV up our OOV OOV as part of the OOV programme which he OOV we support .
<P> Finally , can he OOV us is he OOV our OOV that development is the best form of conflict OOV and to OOV OOV to OOV the EU 's development programme to OOV the need for OOV OOV in future years .
<SPEAKER OOV NAME=" OOV " > Mr President , I am OOV to be able to OOV to the excellent report by Mr OOV OOV , on the OOV OOV OOV .
OOV is a OOV and OOV .
We used to be , indeed , OOV OOV before he OOV , I hope OOV , OOV the OOV , but I am not at all OOV , OOV the OOV , that this is such an excellent report .
<P> The OOV OOV OOV , as it is OOV in the report , is of course now OOV the OOV OOV OOV to OOV any possible OOV with the OOV OOV OOV over which , OOV me OOV for the OOV of OOV of OOV of the OOV from the country I know best , I have no responsibility OOV .
That is a OOV OOV " rather than an OOV OOV , just for the OOV of the OOV OOV of The OOV OOV .
<P> I have to say I did OOV to the OOV by my OOV , Mr OOV OOV .
I OOV that it was a good example of OOV on OOV .
I must say that his OOV OOV concerned what I think is OOV No OOV and , as I shall say OOV we are OOV to OOV No OOV . But , if there is some OOV about the OOV of what we are OOV to do , I have to say that it is OOV because of what some of those who agree with the OOV OOV have been OOV about these proposals .
<P> If OOV like my OOV OOV do not OOV of this , I have to ask the question , not OOV OOV , what the OOV will they OOV OOV of ?
In the OOV when I was OOV of the OOV of which the OOV gentlemen is a OOV , we actually OOV in OOV to OOV up the OOV of financial OOV .
We actually OOV in OOV to OOV through OOV OOV .
So , I OOV what the OOV my OOV OOV and his OOV actually believe in these OOV .
I think it would be OOV to look OOV those OOV OOV of The OOV OOV for one 's information on an important subject like this .
<P> OOV , I am responsible for OOV that the Commission is able to OOV OOV and OOV in a OOV both on its own and , as is OOV more OOV to be the case , as part of an OOV European Union OOV to OOV including those in which the European Union OOV OOV OOV might find itself OOV .
The OOV of recent years has been very clear .
OOV to OOV very often OOV the OOV of a OOV OOV of OOV , OOV OOV the military , OOV including OOV and programmes for which the Commission has a responsibility or OOV from trade policy to OOV aid , from the OOV of OOV OOV to OOV on the OOV with OOV OOV , OOV management , OOV to the OOV OOV and so on .
<P> OOV often in the OOV , take the OOV for example , we have just not been able to OOV with the OOV or OOV that OOV in the real world OOV .
OOV , we have had to OOV through OOV OOV in OOV which has OOV down OOV who should have been OOV every OOV to OOV the OOV done in the field .
That , I OOV , was my OOV when I OOV into this OOV .
We are OOV to OOV these OOV .
OOV is OOV by real OOV , not OOV OOV .
<P> I have OOV a great deal of my attention since I OOV a Commissioner to OOV to improve that OOV on the OOV .
I think we have OOV to make progress , as I believe our OOV to recent OOV in OOV has OOV .
There the Commission was in the all too OOV position of being OOV by the local government and by other OOV for the OOV with which we were able to OOV .
But this is still too OOV , and OOV help where it is OOV OOV still OOV a great deal of OOV on the part of our OOV to OOV their way through OOV OOV .
<P> We OOV it to them and to those we are OOV to help to OOV them OOV to do the OOV .
That is what this proposal for a OOV OOV OOV is all about .
OOV as the OOV OOV which we are OOV to our OOV OOV programmes OOV the world are OOV to ensure that the European Union aid programme OOV to OOV and to OOV a OOV for OOV .
The OOV OOV OOV will OOV us to OOV very OOV and to OOV OOV Community funds in OOV to OOV or OOV OOV .
The OOV OOV under OOV in the Council OOV the amendments OOV by Parliament .
We want to ensure OOV OOV both OOV and OOV , OOV with OOV OOV rules , for example , in favour of OOV OOV of information to the Council and the European Parliament and OOV as much as possible the OOV process .
<P> The OOV will be for the OOV OOV OOV to be OOV to OOV with the OOV OOV OOV of a OOV , OOV the OOV on OOV of the OOV Community programme , be it OOV or OOV , or OOV .
OOV under the OOV will be OOV in time and OOV up to EUR OOV OOV each time .
<P> OOV before OOV OOV to the amendments OOV me OOV to one or two points in the debate .
<P> OOV Mr OOV OOV and Mr OOV - who OOV OOV after OOV - OOV that I should give OOV of when the OOV OOV OOV would be OOV .
OOV the first problem I had to deal with when I OOV a Commissioner was how to OOV OOV OOV to the OOV OOV OOV in OOV .
OOV , it OOV our OOV OOV to get that done .
We have actually OOV to do it in a way which I believe OOV the Court of OOV as well as OOV OOV into those OOV very OOV .
The only other country , the only other OOV which actually OOV involved as well , because of the OOV of what we were taking on , was OOV to which I OOV particularly OOV OOV , but it was a difficult OOV , it would have been OOV if we had had this OOV in place in order to do it .
<P> I was OOV about conflict OOV and I very much agree with what the OOV OOV , my OOV OOV I might say even OOV we are not OOV of the same OOV , Mr OOV , had to say about this , who OOV more about conflict OOV than most of the OOV of us put together .
The important OOV about conflict OOV is that it should be OOV and OOV , and I OOV the OOV OOV .
<P> OOV , Mr OOV OOV me to say whether I OOV that development OOV is the best form of conflict OOV .
OOV course I do .
OOV used development OOV OOV with a OOV and OOV OOV to the OOV relations between countries is by far the most OOV way of OOV to OOV with OOV , a point made OOV the other OOV in an excellent OOV in The OOV OOV by OOV OOV OOV together the OOV of a number of OOV OOV on OOV in OOV and in other OOV .
So of course I agree with that , but the Commission will actually be OOV forward in the next OOV or two a OOV on conflict OOV in which we will OOV to OOV together some of the OOV OOV which are being OOV both in the Commission and OOV for conflict OOV which is OOV , as we have to OOV with the OOV OOV of OOV , the major subject on the OOV of OOV and OOV OOV .
<P> But in OOV the OOV , in OOV the resources to deal with conflict OOV , I just want to make one point .
It is not a question of the Commission OOV one OOV in order to find OOV OOV .
The Commission only has the OOV which the OOV OOV OOV , which the Council and which Parliament OOV , and my view , which I will be OOV once again in the OOV OOV Council next OOV , is the Commission for too long has OOV OOV to get OOV without OOV OOV and has been OOV with all the political OOV of OOV OOV itself .
I think we need to OOV Parliament and OOV much more in OOV the OOV between our political and development OOV and our OOV OOV OOV the world , because if we only have a OOV OOV of OOV to OOV , as we will have for the OOV future , for OOV as long as there is a OOV OOV , we will always have to make very difficult OOV between OOV , and not OOV will like what those OOV are .
But I agree with what the OOV Member said about development OOV and with his view that it should be OOV OOV towards the OOV of OOV .
<P> OOV me deal with the amendments OOV by Parliament .
OOV the OOV put forward , the Commission can take on OOV OOV , OOV as they are or with small OOV OOV .
That is a OOV of how OOV we are on this issue .
<P> We have OOV with OOV amendments .
OOV , OOV No OOV : the first part OOV about the need for the OOV OOV OOV to be OOV by the OOV up of civil OOV OOV .
We are OOV with that OOV , but we cannot go OOV with the European OOV OOV OOV OOV in the second part of the OOV , which is OOV well OOV the Commission 's OOV .
I hope my OOV OOV , Mr OOV OOV , OOV OOV of that and that I can at least OOV that OOV .
<P> OOV No OOV OOV a new OOV on the financial OOV OOV the OOV OOV OOV for the OOV and its OOV OOV .
This OOV OOV to OOV from an OOV OOV of the whole OOV which OOV OOV in the European Parliament have OOV up .
It is now very clear that there is no question of OOV OOV or OOV out of OOV or to OOV OOV under that OOV into a Community framework .
The OOV is OOV a Community OOV , and so is the OOV of its OOV .
<P> We cannot OOV OOV No OOV , because the " Community " is not the OOV OOV .
OOV the OOV OOV is OOV to OOV OOV financial OOV in the OOV .
<P> Finally , the Commission would not of itself have been against OOV No OOV , but we have in a OOV of OOV OOV the OOV put forward by the Council to OOV the OOV of OOV , given the OOV OOV OOV in other OOV .
<P> These are not , I am OOV as OOV Members will OOV , OOV OOV OOV .
That is because OOV we OOV the same OOV : to improve our OOV OOV , to improve our OOV in OOV .
That is , I OOV , what this OOV is all about .
I very much welcome the support which OOV most OOV Members have given it OOV far .
I hope very much that OOV Members will give it a OOV OOV this OOV because , like you , I want to have it OOV as OOV as possible .
<P> This is all about the OOV and the OOV of the European Union OOV the world .
If OOV Members do not support this , I OOV , OOV OOV what they think the European Union is for .
<P> OOV OOV OOV OOV <SPEAKER OOV NAME=" President " > The next OOV is the following OOV OOV : <P> OOV by Mr OOV , on behalf of the Committee on OOV OOV , OOV Rights , OOV OOV and OOV OOV , to the Council , on the OOV OOV 's OOV of OOV , <P> OOV by Mr OOV , on behalf of the Committee on OOV OOV , OOV Rights , OOV OOV and OOV OOV , to the Commission , on the OOV OOV 's OOV of OOV .
<SPEAKER OOV LANGUAGE="DE " NAME=" OOV " > Madam President , ladies and gentlemen , OOV me to say a few words on the question OOV by the Committee on OOV OOV , OOV Rights , OOV OOV and OOV OOV , especially on the basis of the OOV OOV by Mr OOV and other OOV of OOV on their OOV to OOV OOV .
I believe that we in the European Union have a more important role to OOV there than we have OOV done and that our policy cannot OOV at support for the OOV programme .
It is certainly OOV that , with OOV Member States having now OOV OOV OOV relations , we have not been able to OOV a OOV approach in our OOV with OOV OOV .
<P> OOV year was an OOV OOV one in the OOV OOV , especially on account of the OOV between OOV and OOV OOV and the OOV of OOV that was made possible by this OOV in OOV relations .
We must be aware that this area still has the OOV to be a major OOV OOV , but there is OOV a real political opportunity now to achieve a OOV peace OOV .
That is why it is OOV that the European Union , as an international OOV in a OOV political world , should become OOV in this OOV .
<P> It is a matter of OOV a policy which can OOV the way for democracy and human rights in OOV OOV and which , on that basis , can OOV a OOV part in the development of OOV greater OOV between the two OOV of OOV , an OOV which , following the meeting between the two OOV , has OOV OOV the first public OOV about national OOV for many OOV .
<P> OOV a policy must also be OOV with a means of OOV OOV of the OOV situation and the health system in OOV OOV and must OOV us to OOV appropriate measures of aid into a political OOV so as to OOV about an OOV in the general situation and OOV also to OOV the development on which the OOV peace of the region OOV , for the peace of that region , of course , is of OOV importance too .
As an OOV OOV , OOV OOV is an important OOV on the world OOV , and its development of OOV OOV of OOV OOV and OOV systems OOV it a country which could OOV OOV a serious OOV to other OOV of the OOV OOV and to other OOV .
<P> Madam President , I believe that we must therefore OOV OOV in these OOV , so as to OOV the OOV of OOV and OOV OOV to OOV OOV .
<P> I hope that you will support this OOV for a resolution and that the Council and the Commission can agree on a OOV approach with Parliament which will OOV us to make our contribution in that part of the world , not least in our own interests .
<SPEAKER OOV LANGUAGE="SV" NAME=" OOV " > Madam President , ladies and gentlemen , during the meeting OOV in OOV between OOV and OOV OOV of last year within the framework of the political OOV , the European OOV OOV the most important OOV of the European Union ' s OOV towards the OOV OOV ' s OOV of OOV - OOV which had been OOV by the Council at its OOV on OOV OOV and OOV OOV .
<P> OOV me just OOV to OOV the three most important of these OOV .
OOV of all , the European Union ' s support for work on OOV OOV peace between the two OOV States .
OOV , the importance of the OOV OOV ' s OOV of OOV ' s OOV a responsible OOV when it OOV to the OOV of OOV OOV and OOV OOV , as well as OOV a OOV to OOV of OOV .
OOV , respect for the OOV s OOV on OOV Rights .
<P> OOV it OOV to OOV OOV relations with the OOV OOV ' s OOV of OOV , the Council agreed on OOV OOV of last year that the OOV parties must OOV between themselves and OOV the Council of the OOV of their OOV with OOV .
<P> The Council has OOV OOV the OOV OOV ' s OOV of OOV to OOV fully with its OOV under the OOV Treaty and OOV to OOV , OOV or OOV any OOV or OOV OOV .
The European Union has also OOV upon the OOV OOV ' s OOV of OOV to OOV and OOV the OOV OOV OOV OOV Treaty .
OOV , the European Union has OOV the OOV OOV ' s OOV of OOV that it OOV OOV measures to be taken on these issues .
<P> In all OOV with the OOV OOV ' s OOV of OOV , the European Union has OOV its great concern about the serious OOV of human rights in the country , about the number of political OOV , about the OOV of national legislation and about the OOV authorities ' OOV to OOV with international OOV in OOV of human rights .
OOV have been made for OOV on these issues .
<P> We shall continue to OOV the importance of these issues .
The European Union OOV the decision by the OOV OOV ' s OOV to OOV its OOV under the OOV OOV on OOV and OOV Rights during the year 2000 and OOV that the country will now , on the basis of its own report , be able to OOV into a OOV and OOV OOV with the OOV OOV Rights Committee <P> On the issue of measures to be taken , the Council has OOV upon the Commission to OOV OOV with the issue of OOV measures of support which may be taken within those OOV to which priority has been given .
The Council and the Commission will , as OOV as possible , be OOV what measures are possible in order to open the European market to OOV OOV OOV .
OOV OOV will be OOV in those areas OOV as having priority .
The European Union will make efforts to OOV the political OOV with the OOV of OOV , OOV efforts to OOV a OOV between the two OOV States are fully OOV by the European Union .
It is also a question of OOV areas in which OOV measures might be taken , for example on the issue of OOV aid and economic cooperation with the OOV OOV ' s OOV of OOV .
<SPEAKER OOV NAME=" OOV " > Madam President , I very much welcome the opportunity of OOV a few words on this extremely important subject .
OOV OOV on the OOV OOV are of great interest and concern to all of us in Europe and the contribution that we make in OOV to OOV OOV on the OOV OOV , in OOV to OOV , as it were , the OOV OOV government and society in out of the OOV .
OOV efforts OOV the OOV to which Europe has a OOV role to OOV and they OOV , in a OOV , the role that OOV has been OOV the OOV - OOV to support OOV there .
We OOV have OOV in other OOV .
<P> A European Union approach towards recent OOV in the OOV OOV was agreed at the OOV OOV OOV of OOV OOV and OOV OOV last year .
This approach OOV , as I have said , to support the OOV OOV process in order to OOV about peace and OOV on the OOV OOV .
OOV this approach as the basis for Commission action , the Commission will OOV and is OOV OOV its OOV to OOV OOV .
OOV , in the last few years , that OOV has OOV - including the contribution to the OOV OOV OOV OOV OOV - about EUR OOV .
<P> However , any OOV should be OOV in OOV to OOV of progress of the OOV in areas of OOV concern to us and , I know , to Members of this House .
OOV , for example , for human rights ; OOV issues ; OOV for the OOV to OOV aid ; better OOV conditions for OOV - a point I was able to make to the OOV OOV OOV in OOV last OOV - and the OOV up of the OOV 's OOV and the OOV OOV that will be a necessary part of that .
<P> This approach has been OOV to the OOV OOV authorities at the recent OOV OOV OOV meeting in OOV at the end of OOV .
I OOV that my services are OOV Parliament fully OOV of this issue .
Parliament has OOV an OOV interest in this subject for some time .
<P> The OOV and OOV OOV OOV to the OOV - OOV EUR OOV since OOV - will continue .
A new OOV security programme for 2000 , OOV EUR OOV , has just been adopted by the Commission .
I should point out that we have OOV from OOV OOV aid to OOV OOV OOV and , in particular , the OOV of OOV and OOV OOV to OOV agricultural OOV .
The implementation of OOV OOV OOV in the year 2000 will OOV well into the OOV of this year .
<P> OOV aid - OOV OOV , OOV , OOV and OOV OOV - is OOV to continue on a more OOV basis , but at a level OOV to OOV to real OOV needs .
We also have the OOV to OOV , with OOV OOV , any further progress made by the OOV authorities , OOV in terms of OOV to the most OOV OOV and the OOV of working conditions for OOV organisations .
<P> In OOV , the Commission is now OOV possible measures in the OOV of OOV OOV and trade , which could be OOV OOV if OOV OOV OOV progress in the areas I have mentioned .
As a first OOV , these measures OOV a general increase in the OOV OOV OOV by OOV % , OOV % in the case of a few OOV OOV .
<P> A OOV OOV OOV will be OOV OOV to OOV needs and OOV areas in which OOV OOV OOV OOV could be OOV .
But they certainly OOV an area which , I know , has been of interest to Mr OOV - that is the whole question of the energy OOV in OOV OOV which will be so important to the country 's economic future .
<P> As to the OOV of OOV relations between the European Community and the OOV , the Commission is OOV the appropriate OOV of such a OOV in OOV OOV with Member States .
<P> Finally , clearly the OOV OOV , President OOV OOV , has been OOV OOV in the efforts that he has made to OOV OOV on the OOV .
OOV clearly , President OOV OOV has been very OOV about what can be OOV in the OOV OOV .
I do not think he OOV OOV OOV about the OOV and development .
<P> What is important is to OOV our OOV on the OOV and to OOV working towards it .
We should take our OOV from President OOV OOV , who is one of the great OOV of our OOV .
I hope that with his OOV the European Union will continue to OOV its part in OOV that the OOV OOV , the region and , indeed , the world , OOV peace and OOV .
The OOV if we were to continue to OOV the OOV , if the OOV was to continue to be OOV to be OOV , are too OOV to OOV .
<SPEAKER OOV LANGUAGE="FR" NAME=" OOV " > Madam President , the resolution on OOV OOV , on which Parliament is about to vote , has a political OOV of the first OOV .
OOV only will the European Parliament itself OOV its position on the OOV OOV of the OOV OOV , but it will also have OOV the new OOV of this position for all the European OOV .
In my OOV as OOV of the OOV OOV OOV , OOV OOV to OOV OOV OOV the OOV of this resolution , I should like to OOV three OOV OOV with you .
<P> The first is the OOV of a new OOV in OOV relations between the two OOV , OOV by the policy of OOV , or OOV OOV , of President OOV OOV OOV , who made an important OOV OOV with his OOV OOV in OOV 2000 to OOV .
Europe has a OOV to support the efforts of the OOV people as a whole and the OOV political OOV with a view to OOV OOV and OOV peace in OOV .
This is the OOV in which our policy on OOV must be OOV and the OOV of our policy OOV must be OOV .
<P> OOV , OOV is the last OOV in the world that is still OOV by a OOV .
OOV the example of OOV and OOV , OOV can now OOV to see the OOV of cooperation with a view to OOV this OOV OOV .
Europe , which the two OOV OOV have OOV to OOV them in OOV new economic and political relations within OOV , must OOV the OOV and point the OOV towards the OOV to OOV after a long and difficult time as a OOV OOV .
The European example of the OOV OOV of area without OOV OOV is being OOV upon to OOV as an example in this OOV .
OOV again we have a political responsibility to provide every OOV aid to a OOV which is OOV OOV its OOV OOV .
<P> Finally , I would like to OOV you that , more OOV as OOV OOV OOV , OOV and OOV must be OOV to the OOV once and for all .
The OOV OOV OOV OOV OOV to be open and to OOV OOV with OOV OOV , the United States , Europe and OOV , and although , in the OOV OOV , they must be OOV on their OOV , I am OOV that a European policy of OOV , OOV and OOV OOV , will make a OOV contribution to OOV in the OOV OOV ' s OOV of OOV that will OOV the OOV world .
<SPEAKER OOV NAME=" OOV " > Madam President , can I say we have made OOV progress over the last three years in terms of relations with the OOV
We have now had three OOV OOV OOV and the resolution OOV for the OOV to come here again to continue the OOV .
We have OOV the European Commission OOV from not OOV to the OOV OOV to having an OOV OOV in OOV and we have now OOV from OOV Member States with OOV relations to , I OOV , OOV in the process of OOV OOV relations with the OOV
<P> I would like very much to see the European Community also OOV OOV relations with the OOV
We give OOV to the OOV OOV as Mr OOV has said , we give OOV and OOV aid and are OOV to give other OOV OOV , a OOV of EUR OOV OOV .
It is OOV to be OOV that without having the OOV to have a political OOV .
We need a OOV on human rights , we need a OOV on OOV OOV , we need a OOV on economic development .
<P> The OOV is that with the OOV of the OOV OOV , the OOV to make the OOV from the OOV OOV OOV of the OOV to the new OOV OOV and a OOV of OOV OOV , the OOV is in OOV OOV .
OOV are OOV that the OOV OOV OOV has OOV to the OOV OOV of OOV million OOV OOV , one in OOV of the OOV .
OOV their only OOV are OOV OOV and military OOV .
<P> If we can find a OOV , we can help the people of the OOV to help themselves with OOV aid and OOV in OOV and OOV OOV , OOV and OOV energy OOV .
OOV if we OOV OOV in OOV the OOV to OOV military OOV then we may OOV the OOV OOV OOV to OOV its OOV OOV OOV to national OOV OOV with the OOV to world peace and OOV that OOV .
I would like to OOV President OOV OOV of the OOV of OOV on his OOV to the OOV policy which will OOV the OOV of OOV relations and welcome OOV OOV OOV 's positive OOV .
<P> OOV is the way forward .
Europe should OOV this not only because it is OOV the policy of the OOV of OOV but because it is the right way to go .
OOV OOV is that we are not OOV or the United States and we can OOV as OOV OOV in this most OOV area of the world .
<SPEAKER OOV OOV " NAME=" OOV > Mr President , it would OOV that the OOV OOV by the OOV OOV between the two OOV from OOV and OOV OOV are not going to be OOV .
The OOV is OOV .
OOV OOV is OOV it difficult to make good those few , OOV OOV OOV it made in the military field , it is OOV the OOV of OOV who were OOV by the OOV and have OOV so for OOV years and it is OOV no OOV of OOV to make the OOV OOV of OOV OOV OOV to OOV , OOV for OOV this year , a OOV OOV , and it is not yet OOV when or whether this will take place .
<P> President OOV 's decision not to go to OOV OOV , even OOV he OOV to in order to OOV his presidency with a OOV OOV , could now OOV a long OOV in OOV 's process of OOV up to the OOV world .
In OOV of this , I OOV OOV of OOV and I see European countries OOV up - Mr OOV OOV on the issue just now - and OOV over themselves in the OOV to OOV the OOV OOV OOV , OOV a OOV OOV to what OOV on in the country , to the OOV OOV of human rights .
<P> OOV , I say : OOV , certainly , OOV us OOV OOV between the two OOV ; of course we must provide OOV for the OOV OOV to OOV them from OOV to OOV - Mr OOV mentioned this just now - but , at the same time , we must OOV down OOV conditions to ensure that the aid OOV the OOV where it is OOV OOV and does not OOV to support a OOV , OOV OOV which is OOV to OOV to the OOV of OOV and OOV OOV to ensure its OOV .
<SPEAKER OOV LANGUAGE="SV" NAME=" OOV " > Madam President , I should like to thank the OOV Members for the OOV OOV that have been made in this OOV on the important issue of the European Union ' s OOV with the OOV OOV ' s OOV of OOV .
OOV me just to make a few OOV OOV OOV .
<P> It is OOV that an agreement has now been made within the European Union to make a better OOV to OOV the issue of OOV OOV relations with the OOV
A number of EU Member States , including my own country , have had OOV relations with the OOV OOV ' s OOV of OOV the whole time .
OOV have OOV OOV to OOV relations , OOV a further group is OOV to take a decision on OOV relations .
<P> I OOV believe that a OOV OOV is of great importance .
OOV years OOV , I OOV had the opportunity to OOV in OOV and know what it means to be OOV OOV with the OOV of that country .
<P> I would also OOV you of the OOV made by OOV OOV ' s President OOV OOV OOV on his OOV to OOV in OOV with OOV the OOV OOV OOV in OOV .
OOV made a public OOV at that time for a more important role for the European Union where the situation on the OOV OOV is concerned .
I believe we must take his OOV OOV .
We should be OOV also to OOV to this OOV of OOV when the time is right .
It is important for us to agree within the European Union about what we are to do when we OOV a position on such measures .
We OOV to have an agreed view on to what OOV there are OOV OOV of making progress in what we are OOV , and it is OOV also important for conditions in the OOV OOV ' s OOV of OOV to be such that it OOV OOV to do something .
<SPEAKER OOV NAME=" President " > OOV you , OOV .
<P> I must OOV you that I have OOV a OOV for a resolution under OOV OOV ) of the OOV of OOV .
<P> The debate is OOV .
<P> The vote will take place at OOV OOV .
<P> I OOV OOV the OOV .
We shall OOV at OOV for the OOV .
<P> ( The OOV was OOV at OOV OOV and OOV at OOV OOV ) OOV OOV OOV <SPEAKER OOV LANGUAGE="DE " NAME=" OOV " > Mr President , our group , as you know , did not vote for the OOV report in committee .
We would support it here , however , if OOV OOV OOV and OOV were adopted .
We have OOV this with the other OOV .
In the case of OOV No OOV , I am OOV that other OOV would be able to support the OOV if two OOV OOV were made .
The first is the OOV of the OOV OOV ' by the OOV OOV ' as the OOV OOV of the OOV OOV ; this is only a OOV OOV .
<P> The second , however , would be an OOV OOV .
We ask that the OOV OOV in the OOV OOV of OOV No OOV be OOV by the OOV OOV and that the OOV OOV OOV OOV ' be OOV OOV by the OOV OOV ' .
OOV I ask you to OOV this OOV OOV and to put the OOV OOV of OOV No OOV to the vote .
<SPEAKER OOV LANGUAGE="SV" NAME=" OOV " > Mr President , I am OOV to support those amendments that have just been OOV OOV OOV No OOV , because the proposal including these OOV is OOV better than the OOV OOV .
I would therefore OOV OOV to OOV the OOV amendments which Mr OOV OOV from the Group of the European OOV ' s OOV .

As Commissioner OOV OOV out during the debate , it is not the " Community " which OOV the OOV OOV , it is the OOV OOV .
I should like to OOV OOV that we OOV the OOV " Community " and OOV OOV the words " OOV OOV , so that the OOV would now OOV : " The OOV OOV shall each year set a OOV OOV for OOV action under this OOV . "

I would point out that only OOV country of employment principle ' is OOV to in the OOV , when it should OOV OOV country of OOV or employment principle ' because of course I cannot OOV what OOV the Commission has to make , it must do that for itself .
But I would like to OOV OOV country of OOV or employment principle ' , OOV .
<P> OOV OOV No OOV <SPEAKER OOV OOV " OOV OOV " > Mr President , it has been agreed with the rapporteur , Mrs OOV , that when it OOV to OOV No OOV of OOV OOV , we should regard this OOV as an OOV to the OOV OOV .
This means , therefore , that if OOV No OOV is OOV , the OOV OOV will also have to be put to the vote .
<SPEAKER OOV OOV " NAME=" OOV " > Mr President , I would OOV we vote on OOV No OOV first , and then on the OOV OOV two , because that would be a more OOV way of OOV .

So long as that is the OOV OOV .
<P> ( Parliament adopted the resolution ) <P> OOV resolution ( OOV ) , on behalf of the Committee on the OOV , OOV OOV and OOV OOV , on the OOV implementation of environment OOV <P> ( Parliament adopted the resolution ) <P> OOV ( OOV ) by Mr OOV , on behalf of the Committee on OOV and OOV OOV , on the situation and OOV of young farmers in the European Union OOV OOV OOV <P> ( Parliament adopted the resolution ) <P> OOV ( OOV ) by Mr OOV OOV , on behalf of the Committee on OOV , on the common fisheries policy and the OOV of economic OOV OOV OOV <P> ( Parliament adopted the resolution ) <P> OOV ( OOV ) by Mr OOV , on behalf of the Committee on OOV , on the Commission report to the Council and the European Parliament on the OOV of the Community system for fisheries and OOV in OOV <P> OOV ) OOV - OOV - OOV OOV <P> ( Parliament adopted the resolution ) <P> OOV ( OOV ) by Mr OOV , on behalf of the Committee on OOV , on the Commission report on the regional OOV OOV by the Commission in OOV on the common fisheries policy after OOV <P> OOV ) OOV - OOV - OOV OOV <P> ( Parliament adopted the resolution ) <P> OOV OOV for a resolution ( ) on depleted uranium in OOV and OOV <SPEAKER OOV NAME=" OOV " > Mr President , you mentioned that I had OOV that OOV on behalf of the OOV Group .
I want to make it OOV clear that this is a OOV , or if it is not a OOV , it is some OOV OOV by the OOV OOV OOV of the OOV OOV .
<P> I was OOV a OOV and I OOV that I will OOV a OOV .
<P> ( OOV ) <SPEAKER OOV NAME=" President " > We would OOV have OOV OOV .
It was a OOV on the part of the services .
<SPEAKER OOV NAME=" OOV " > Mr President , I would like to make it just as clear that although my first OOV is OOV , I have not become a OOV .
<P> <P> ( Parliament adopted the resolution ) <P> OOV for a resolution ( OOV ) , on behalf of the Committee on OOV OOV , OOV Rights , OOV and OOV OOV , on relations between the European Union and the OOV OOV 's OOV of OOV <P> ( Parliament adopted the resolution ) <P> OOV OOV OOV OOV report ( OOV ) <SPEAKER OOV LANGUAGE="FR" OOV and OOV > .
( OOV ) We think the report OOV by OOV OOV , on behalf of the OOV Group of the European United OOV - OOV OOV OOV , on the OOV of OOV OOV in Europe is particularly important , especially for OOV , as this is one of the countries where the implementation of the OOV OOV , which is now over OOV years OOV , and the OOV OOV OOV , which is now over OOV years OOV - as well as the OOV of the OOV 2000 OOV - has OOV the OOV OOV , to the point that it has been OOV OOV .
OOV , the more time that OOV , the more the ( OOV OOV OOV are OOV , and the more difficult it OOV to OOV or to OOV the OOV in all their OOV and OOV .
<P> OOV from being OOV " , the need to OOV and OOV OOV ( and OOV the OOV of the OOV ) OOV out as a political issue of OOV importance , with OOV OOV for our OOV conditions ( including for OOV change ) .
It is not a matter of OOV up OOV OOV " where OOV would be OOV as if they were in a OOV , but of OOV environmental concerns in all Community and Member State policy .
The implementation of the OOV and OOV OOV OOV must OOV be OOV OOV and OOV OOV the OOV .
<SPEAKER OOV OOV " NAME=" OOV OOV OOV " > .
( OOV ) The OOV ( OOV OOV ' s Union ) OOV OOV OOV and OOV OOV did not support the amendments OOV by the OOV and OOV OOV in OOV to the OOV directive .
We regard these amendments as an OOV to OOV the OOV OOV directive .
We would point out that the OOV OOV directive OOV the government OOV opportunity to OOV in when the implementation of OOV OOV is OOV by the OOV OOV .
OOV all , OOV OOV ( OOV ) of OOV OOV OOV : " If , in OOV of a OOV OOV of the OOV for the OOV and in the OOV of OOV OOV , a plan or OOV must OOV be OOV out for OOV OOV of OOV public interest , including those of a social or economic OOV , the Member State shall take all OOV measures necessary to ensure that the OOV OOV of OOV 2000 is OOV .
It shall OOV the Commission of the OOV measures adopted . "
The OOV OOV have since OOV a OOV question to the Commission , OOV it to provide an OOV of all the OOV it has OOV in this matter since the directive OOV into OOV .
<SPEAKER OOV LANGUAGE="FR" NAME=" OOV " > I am in OOV agreement with the OOV OOV and its OOV in terms of OOV the OOV OOV OOV heritage of the countries of the European Union .
<P> This heritage and its OOV and OOV OOV are the OOV ' s most OOV OOV and we must indeed ensure that they are OOV , OOV and OOV down to future OOV .
<P> OOV so , I OOV against the OOV report for two OOV OOV .
OOV , it is OOV to OOV European OOV OOV to our countries by making them OOV , in OOV OOV , upon OOV with the OOV OOV as it OOV .
<P> If it were OOV a matter of OOV that European funds are not used to OOV OOV OOV these OOV OOV , then I should have OOV the resolution and OOV in favour of it , but it is OOV and OOV to make a European Union policy OOV upon OOV with another and that social conditions should be subject , for example , to environmental conditions .
<P> OOV second reason is that the resolution does not OOV the OOV of OOV " and the legal OOV , which is so OOV OOV that legal OOV could be OOV , which might OOV to OOV on OOV OOV where these are OOV under the OOV OOV and the OOV law in the OOV .
<P> It is OOV because the European Union OOV OOV this OOV that some countries OOV problems in OOV their " OOV 2000 " OOV and in OOV the OOV OOV OOV , without OOV on the part of the farmers in those countries , even OOV OOV OOV the OOV OOV of the OOV of the directive .
<P> OOV report ( OOV ) <SPEAKER OOV OOV " NAME=" OOV " > Mr President , last OOV I OOV on OOV to OOV , and , as is my OOV , I OOV a few words with one of the local OOV OOV , or rather with a OOV from OOV would have OOV OOV to have become a OOV .
OOV been OOV that I am the OOV of the OOV OOV ' OOV , he OOV to me : " I go out to OOV to OOV , I work OOV it is possible and I would like to work many OOV so that I can have a OOV as well .
However , OOV , because our OOV is OOV by European Union fishing OOV , I cannot find enough work to OOV to a OOV , and I do not see OOV of the European Union OOV OOV to the Government of OOV for the Government does not give me OOV at OOV .
<P> I therefore OOV for the report , but on OOV that things improve in future .
<SPEAKER OOV LANGUAGE="FR" NAME=" OOV , OOV and OOV " > This report and its amendments deal with financial support to OOV in the fisheries sector .
OOV our many OOV , we OOV in favour of them out of OOV with the people of that country , especially its OOV .
<P> OOV , because the OOV of the fisheries OOV between the European Union and third countries are , as is OOV OOV in some other reports , OOV to OOV European Union fisheries resources and , OOV , to increase OOV from the OOV of other countries .
OOV , because we do not know OOV how this aid will be used and what its OOV OOV OOV will be .
OOV , however , too much of this aid is often OOV more than a OOV OOV OOV OOV to the European OOV OOV in these countries .
OOV , such aid is often also OOV by the local OOV .
<P> OOV all that , at the end of the OOV , this OOV , which is OOV to OOV the local people , will , even so , be better OOV over there than the OOV given to major OOV over here who are OOV OOV .
<P> OOV OOV OOV report ( OOV ) <SPEAKER OOV OOV " NAME=" OOV " > Mr President , after OOV in OOV for a OOV last OOV , I OOV on to OOV , where I did not OOV very long for it is not a very OOV State .
I OOV an OOV OOV there as well , and he , aware that I am the OOV of the OOV OOV ' OOV , OOV me : " But what is a OOV ? "
OOV , Mr President , the people of OOV are so OOV OOV that they do not even know the OOV of the OOV OOV " .
So I said to OOV : " OOV the OOV OOV OOV OOV is put to the vote , OOV to vote for the OOV , OOV , but also OOV that we OOV to OOV the OOV and ensure that the aid given to the people of OOV through this agreement also OOV to provide a OOV or two with a State OOV " .
<SPEAKER OOV LANGUAGE="FR" NAME=" OOV , OOV and OOV " > The Committee on OOV and OOV OOV the fact that the OOV of OOV of OOV ' s OOV industry is OOV that of the country ' s OOV OOV .
These OOV , however , are OOV OOV the work of the major OOV , OOV OOV , which have set up OOV in this country .
<P> OOV there is no OOV that these OOV are OOV OOV by OOV the OOV workers of this country , including OOV , this is not about to OOV OOV to OOV from its OOV state or to OOV its working OOV to OOV OOV .
<P> The report OOV for an increase in " the OOV and OOV of the OOV sector " on world OOV .
This is a clear OOV of who it OOV to OOV from the OOV of the OOV OOV " , especially " transport and energy infrastructure " , as well as making " the financial system OOV " , or OOV " a OOV and OOV OOV environment " , a OOV for taking action to OOV OOV who , in the OOV OOV , OOV the OOV OOV .
<P> In these OOV , the proposal to OOV European funds is OOV OOV at OOV the OOV of the OOV State and at having the European OOV OOV the costs of the development of infrastructure that the OOV OOV need in order to OOV them to OOV most OOV from one of the OOV OOV in the world .
<SPEAKER OOV NAME=" OOV " > .
I am OOV to OOV with our OOV in the OOV Committee in OOV my full support for the Commission ' s proposal for a new OOV OOV with OOV .
<P> This new agreement is a further OOV of our OOV wish to OOV our relations with OOV .
I hope it will OOV the way open for the OOV government to also OOV their efforts to OOV the OOV of OOV as a further means of OOV the OOV and OOV OOV in the region .
<P> The report by Mr OOV OOV OOV and the OOV resolution clearly set out the main OOV of the OOV OOV and the many OOV OOV the government , its OOV , its OOV and its people .
<P> OOV is one of the OOV OOV countries .
OOV OOV of its OOV of OOV million people is OOV OOV the OOV OOV .
It has OOV with and is OOV OOV with the OOV of OOV and OOV .
OOV this , it has OOV to OOV some OOV in the OOV of OOV over the OOV OOV years .
OOV OOV in the OOV have OOV OOV OOV with OOV , on OOV , OOV to OOV % during the OOV OOV .
<P> OOV is very OOV on OOV aid .
The EU is a major OOV of OOV % of all funds .
The EU is its OOV OOV OOV .
In OOV we OOV OOV % of its OOV .
OOV has a trade OOV with the OOV
OOV a OOV OOV have been OOV by the EU since OOV for OOV OOV : EUR OOV million were OOV for OOV and OOV aid ; EUR OOV million were OOV for the OOV of OOV and for OOV .
<P> I fully OOV the OOV of the OOV programmes to : OOV OOV the OOV and improve the OOV security of the OOV ; help to improve OOV of very OOV women and OOV to quality health and public health services ; improve the OOV of these OOV to education .
This is of OOV importance to the future of OOV .
<P> I was particularly OOV that OOV OOV the OOV ' s programme for the OOV of OOV OOV in OOV and that OOV OOV progress OOV has been OOV since then .
I welcome these efforts and look forward to further progress in this regard .
I want to fully OOV the main OOV of the agreement , OOV : support for OOV economic development , especially as OOV the OOV in society , women and OOV .
<P> The OOV Committee ' s resolution OOV the importance of the OOV general OOV in OOV in OOV of this year .
The European Union should OOV OOV to the OOV OOV from both the government and the OOV to OOV OOV OOV as was the case in the OOV and OOV general OOV .
I hope that OOV of the European Parliament will form part of the OOV .
<P> OOV OOV report ( OOV ) <SPEAKER OOV LANGUAGE="SV" NAME=" OOV " > Mr President , I certainly OOV against OOV No OOV about OOV a European OOV OOV OOV .
I OOV OOV in favour of the report as a whole because I think it good that the European Parliament should once again make it clear that the EU OOV to give priority to OOV OOV management measures .
That is an important OOV that cannot be OOV often enough .
<P> OOV that OOV , I OOV that the OOV , in any case , OOV to the European Parliament ' s OOV OOV to OOV a civil peace OOV .
I think it is good for that to be OOV .
That too cannot be OOV often enough .
<P> OOV , the countries OOV the presidency - OOV , OOV and OOV - OOV not to OOV any attention to the European Parliament ' s OOV OOV .
OOV that OOV , I think that the Swedish Presidency has a OOV opportunity to take the initiative .
I have on a number of OOV had OOV to OOV this OOV to OOV OOV OOV and OOV OOV OOV .
OOV , however , it would OOV that the Swedish Government has not OOV OOV what is OOV by a civil peace OOV but OOV that other measures under way are the same as a civil peace OOV .
It is OOV that it does not want to OOV the report OOV and that it does not respect the European Parliament 's point of view by at least OOV something .
<P> I hope that this is a OOV between OOV and the Swedish Government .
In OOV of our having OOV this many OOV , OOV may of course OOV .
I therefore wish to take the opportunity to OOV the Swedish Government once again .
OOV that OOV has the Presidency of the Council , it should , if it is serious about the OOV s not OOV a military OOV but a OOV for peace , OOV ensure that an initiative is taken in OOV with the European Parliament ' s OOV for a civil peace OOV .
<SPEAKER OOV OOV " NAME=" OOV " > Mr President , what is the OOV OOV OOV ?
I OOV OOV this question when , upon my OOV in OOV to have my OOV put in OOV , I OOV some OOV OOV a small OOV against the OOV of a OOV , which OOV OOV OOV .
But then , as I OOV this OOV 's OOV , I OOV that the OOV OOV OOV is a major financial initiative which will make it possible for Europe to OOV OOV and OOV in order to take peace to OOV where peace is under OOV .
This is a OOV OOV , and I therefore OOV for the report , but I OOV that it may be too OOV for us to OOV since we do not yet have a OOV OOV Europe .
<SPEAKER OOV OOV NAME=" OOV , OOV and OOV " > - ( OOV ) We have OOV in favour of the report because the OOV OOV OOV OOV management are OOV .
At the same time , however , we would OOV that it is in OOV OOV to OOV OOV civil OOV from OOV military OOV .
OOV , we call upon OOV to be OOV out through international organisations such as the OOV , the Council of Europe or the OOV
<SPEAKER OOV LANGUAGE="FR" NAME=" OOV , OOV and OOV " > .
( OOV ) OOV that OOV OOV OOV is , like OOV , the OOV of OOV by other means , and in view of the fact that we have no more OOV in European Union policy than we do in that of Member States , we are OOV to any form of military or OOV OOV by the European Union , OOV it may be .
<P> The report OOV the OOV as an example , but an OOV " European OOV OOV OOV would be no better than that OOV under the OOV of the United OOV , or the United States , in other words .
At the most , it would support the position in the region OOV by the major European OOV OOV that are OOV OOV OOV at the market for the OOV of what the OOV OOV OOV .
<P> OOV , the OOV wish that " the OOV will have no OOV OOV " OOV OOV of OOV to OOV the OOV OOV OOV in OOV or OOV , like those that OOV has OOV in the OOV to OOV OOV from the OOV of their OOV , or like those that OOV OOV is OOV at this very OOV in OOV OOV .
<P> We therefore OOV against the OOV of the OOV OOV OOV , just as we shall vote against any OOV OOV to support it .
<SPEAKER OOV LANGUAGE="FR" NAME=" OOV " > We must welcome the fact that the Council proposal OOV on OOV from the OOV of the OOV , OOV and OOV European OOV which OOV the Union to OOV and make more OOV use of resources in OOV OOV management . "
<P> The European Union has OOV OOV and the resources necessary to set up , at very OOV OOV , OOV such as the OOV of OOV , OOV OOV , OOV OOV OOV and OOV .
This OOV must be OOV to the full , especially as the Union has not been OOV of OOV OOV enough and the OOV for OOV OOV of this OOV were not OOV enough .
<P> The European Commission does not provide for any OOV OOV " to the OOV OOV OOV ( OOV ) .
It does , however , OOV that the OOV must have a " OOV life OOV " .
If OOV call for more OOV OOV , then the resources OOV available , such as the OOV programmes , should be used .
<P> OOV the OOV OOV , by way of example , the OOV will be used in particular for the OOV of OOV OOV OOV and cooperation in OOV OOV .
<SPEAKER OOV OOV OOV " > .
( OOV ) The proposal for a OOV OOV a OOV OOV OOV is OOV more than the framework for what may well be OOV but which is OOV OOV political and economic OOV What the OOV OOV of the European Union want is a OOV OOV to OOV human and financial resources which can OOV OOV not just when there is a " OOV " ( which the OOV of the OOV would do well to OOV ) , but even when there is OOV concern that OOV OOV and cooperation programmes with these countries might be at OOV or even OOV OOV .
OOV course , the OOV OOV the OOV do not OOV their OOV to OOV the OOV measures with the European OOV OOV OOV OOV OOV ) which can be OOV in OOV and order OOV " .
<P> OOV enough , the Committee on OOV OOV OOV the Commission with its amendments OOV the EUR OOV million OOV on each OOV , the OOV Committee and the OOV OOV on each OOV .
<P> The OOV of the OOV OOV of OOV will OOV OOV to OOV this EU policy , which OOV to make third countries OOV and OOV OOV and OOV the OOV OOV .
<P> OOV only are we OOV to any form of OOV OOV or even OOV OOV OOV , we shall do OOV within our OOV to OOV all the people in these countries against any OOV OOV to OOV them and to OOV the place which they OOV in a new , OOV , international order .
<SPEAKER OOV LANGUAGE="FR" OOV and OOV > In OOV to OOV the OOV of a European OOV , the OOV OOV has OOV a new OOV in the OOV of the European Union .
For OOV years , it has been OOV to OOV OOV OOV by OOV to be OOV a social Europe .
OOV with OOV , following the OOV conflict , it has had a change of OOV .
It now OOV OOV that its OOV is the OOV of a European OOV that will OOV European interests " all over the world " .
The OOV OOV of this is OOV to see .
It will do so in OOV with the United States within OOV .
In future , by OOV its OOV and military OOV , the EU will be OOV to OOV what its Member States have done OOV OOV the last OOV .
This is to be OOV out in the OOV of OOV " or OOV " peace , and OOV OOV " .
<P> OOV within and OOV OOV , which is OOV by the United States , the EU is OOV to OOV ' us on its OOV in the OOV of Europe ' s OOV " OOV the United States .
We do not need this OOV .
We are just as OOV OOV to this European OOV as we were to the OOV OOV , as the first OOV will be a OOV increase in the military OOV , which will OOV go hand in hand with OOV OOV OOV .
OOV and OOV OOV will be OOV OOV into the military sector .
It will OOV an OOV OOV of the state OOV to OOV in that sector , with the OOV of OOV a European military industry ( OOV , OOV , OOV ) OOV of OOV the better of the United States .
The workers have OOV to OOV and OOV to OOV in the OOV s OOV " OOV OOV .
<SPEAKER OOV OOV " NAME=" OOV " > .
( OOV ) There is clearly no OOV that it would be OOV appropriate to OOV a OOV OOV OOV and , OOV , the three Community OOV have already OOV positive OOV .
However , over and OOV our common OOV , we feel that certain OOV of the Council 's proposal OOV OOV OOV .
<P> The first is OOV OOV : the OOV of the OOV in question do not OOV to be very clear , OOV from the OOV of OOV OOV .
The rapporteur OOV so far as to OOV OOV the OOV of a European OOV OOV .
<P> OOV if this were the case we could consider the proposal , but it would have to have a different legal basis and , most OOV , a different Community OOV system from that OOV by the recent OOV OOV at OOV . <P> In OOV fact , in our opinion , the OOV OOV of the OOV OOV OOV is to make Community OOV and programmes OOV more OOV and to OOV that OOV more OOV .
<P> OOV , the OOV OOV OOV from the OOV of the conditions for OOV the OOV , which , being very general , still does not give a OOV OOV of them , when it would have been enough , without OOV to the OOV OOV conditions OOV down by Community OOV , to OOV those conditions which , on the basis of their OOV , OOV the OOV OOV .
<P> OOV , it OOV OOV that the OOV of the States within which the OOV may be OOV are not OOV the parties OOV of the OOV of the OOV .
OOV , it OOV OOV that they are not OOV , since they have been OOV by OOV and programmes which , in the case in point , need to be OOV .
<P> Finally , OOV could be OOV to the increase in the OOV of information OOV to the European Parliament , even through the OOV OOV OOV , but , since we hope that the OOV of OOV subject to OOV will be OOV , we feel that , in specific OOV of OOV or political importance , the Commission must not OOV back from OOV Parliament .
<P> In the OOV of these OOV , we support the OOV OOV by the rapporteur and we have therefore OOV for the OOV .
<SPEAKER OOV OOV OOV " > .
For the OOV OOV OOV , OOV OOV have been OOV for the Commission to OOV more OOV financial management and OOV OOV so that it can OOV OOV OOV and OOV programmes , such as OOV action , OOV in time of OOV or when OOV are at OOV .
They support proposals with these OOV in OOV and therefore welcome the Commission initiative for a OOV OOV OOV ( or OOV ) , in OOV of its OOV OOV and some OOV OOV OOV .
<P> OOV OOV OOV is to the amendments which OOV to use this proposal as a OOV for OOV a " European OOV OOV OOV " .
This OOV , for some OOV of European OOV , has OOV OOV and no place in the Commission proposal under OOV .
<P> We were OOV to support the Commission proposal if it did not OOV these amendments ( OOV or OOV ) but OOV if they were OOV .
<P> OOV report ( OOV ) <SPEAKER OOV OOV " NAME=" OOV " > Mr President , as OOV of the OOV ' OOV , how could I not OOV on this OOV , which OOV down how the OOV and health OOV of OOV and other workers , who work in different regions from those in which they OOV and work at other OOV of their OOV , should be OOV .
A OOV from the OOV between OOV and OOV , which is OOV to these OOV , OOV me whether it was OOV that the OOV of people who work in other States of the European Union had been OOV .
" If only they had OOV "
I OOV .
" I would be very OOV , and so would you , for you would be able to find much more , much better work in the other European States .
In any case , I will OOV the issue when I give my OOV of vote on the OOV report , which OOV with this subject " .
<SPEAKER OOV OOV NAME=" OOV , OOV , OOV , OOV and OOV " > - ( OOV ) The OOV OOV OOV importance to OOV OOV to the OOV OOV of OOV .
We have therefore OOV this OOV report which OOV greater efforts to OOV the problems OOV by OOV in social and OOV systems .
However , we are not in favour of OOV a directive OOV the Member States to OOV the OOV of new legislation on OOV workers .
<SPEAKER OOV OOV NAME=" OOV , OOV and OOV " > - ( OOV ) The OOV OOV OOV have today OOV in favour of Mrs OOV s report on the situation of OOV workers in the European Union .
We have done so because this report OOV the many serious problems OOV by OOV workers .
A OOV OOV of these problems can be OOV if the Council OOV a OOV for action .
In OOV of the OOV to OOV OOV OOV OOV in this area at the OOV OOV in OOV , we want to use our vote today to OOV a OOV OOV to the Council and call upon them to OOV a OOV OOV and OOV of OOV No OOV .
<P> We believe that the rules for OOV must be OOV and OOV to OOV .
We cannot therefore support a new directive which OOV new OOV to OOV No OOV .
In OOV with the debate , we have OOV that we cannot support the OOV in the report OOV the OOV of social security OOV through OOV .
In OOV , we want to OOV that we do not consider , OOV , that health OOV such as OOV OOV can be OOV with general services , and that responsibility for this area must continue OOV to be the responsibility of the Member States .
<SPEAKER OOV LANGUAGE="FR" NAME=" OOV , OOV and OOV " > For the most part , this report OOV itself to general OOV without OOV forward any OOV decisions .
OOV when it does put forward a positive OOV such as OOV to OOV OOV by OOV OOV OOV of OOV workers , OOV OOV workers and OOV OOV of their OOV to health OOV OOV and OOV " , the Council is OOV only " with all possible OOV to OOV a position " .
OOV we support this OOV , we OOV from the vote on the report .
<P> OOV the workers of the European Union OOV to OOV from the same social OOV , with each of the OOV areas ( social security , OOV OOV , OOV OOV ) OOV OOV to the OOV of the country where they are most OOV to workers .
<P> In the OOV , in order to improve the situation of OOV workers , they and their OOV should be able to OOV , in each of these areas , between their country of OOV and their country of employment , OOV to the situation most OOV to them .
<SPEAKER OOV LANGUAGE="DE " NAME=" OOV " > .
( OOV ) OOV OOV OOV to the problems of the OOV OOV OOV OOV also means making people aware and OOV of the OOV market and the OOV of OOV it OOV .
This is why I OOV welcome the fact that Mrs OOV 's report OOV a number of these problems and their OOV as well as OOV measures which will OOV the OOV of these OOV between the systems of OOV and social OOV for those who are OOV by them .
<P> The OOV between national legal OOV and the principle of OOV OOV are OOV OOV to the fact that OOV OOV is OOV and , because of the many OOV that have OOV in the OOV since its OOV , can no OOV OOV OOV the legal OOV they OOV .
The OOV OOV of this OOV OOV is that OOV workers are often at a OOV in terms of OOV OOV , OOV , OOV OOV and health OOV .
<P> In the OOV area , I particularly welcome the initiative of OOV in the health sector to OOV OOV ' services which take account of the specific OOV of OOV OOV .
OOV as OOV legal OOV have OOV in the OOV of health and social OOV , a OOV situation has OOV in the OOV of OOV legislation , and the various OOV OOV OOV have not OOV in OOV these OOV .
This OOV areas of OOV , both between OOV OOV and between local authorities , and these can only be OOV in the OOV future through OOV of all our OOV systems on a European OOV .
<P> For this reason , we cannot but support Mrs OOV 's proposal that a directive be adopted which OOV the Member States to OOV all OOV OOV OOV OOV and social OOV for their OOV on OOV OOV and to OOV OOV OOV .
OOV OOV OOV that have been OOV by the European Parliament in favour of the OOV of social and OOV legislation , and OOV the OOV by the Commission of OOV proposals for the OOV and OOV of OOV OOV , the OOV of the Member States have been OOV this necessary OOV process in the Council , OOV OOV the OOV market from OOV a OOV for people in Europe .
<SPEAKER OOV LANGUAGE="DE " NAME=" OOV " > - ( OOV ) The report on the situation of OOV workers with which the Committee on OOV and OOV OOV has OOV us OOV OOV from the OOV OOV of OOV that OOV workers are not subject to OOV in terms of OOV , working conditions and social security and of OOV the problems that still OOV in these areas .
That is what we all want .
<P> However , it is an OOV to OOV , as the OOV OOV of this report OOV , that the OOV market , of which the OOV OOV of workers is a OOV , is an OOV OOV in the OOV OOV of these people .
That is just as much OOV from OOV as various OOV in the resolution ; some of the OOV it OOV are OOV to OOV at open OOV , at least in OOV to the OOV of the OOV OOV workers in OOV .
<P> It is OOV OOV that OOV OOV are OOV from OOV and OOV in the country of employment .
<P> OOV course there are OOV between OOV OOV and the public OOV systems , but such OOV OOV OOV to those who are not OOV workers .
<P> OOV course there are OOV systems of OOV for the OOV .
These not only OOV from one Member State to another but even OOV within Member States .
OOV OOV OOV would be greater if I had been OOV in the public sector .
That , however , is not a problem that OOV concerns OOV workers .
<P> OOV course there are OOV between Member States in terms of the OOV of OOV OOV , OOV and OOV OOV .
The OOV workers who are OOV in OOV OOV in these OOV , because our OOV are far more OOV than those in OOV , OOV and OOV , where our OOV workers OOV .
<P> OOV some OOV of the social security system are OOV in OOV , this does not result in OOV , because OOV workers are also OOV to the OOV OOV , such as those under the OOV OOV , a right which even OOV in OOV and OOV .
<P> The resolution OOV the fact that there is no OOV a clear OOV in Member States between social OOV and social security .
This is not OOV OOV .
OOV OOV is not really a problem for OOV workers at all , because they are OOV with no need of social OOV .
<P> OOV do I OOV what OOV of OOV have to do with OOV workers .
There is , of course , a directive OOV OOV OOV by their OOV , but that directive cannot be OOV to OOV workers .
<P> OOV as far as the OOV of the European Court of OOV in the OOV and OOV OOV are concerned , it is clear that all citizens of the Union , and OOV OOV workers too , can OOV from health services in other Member States .
OOV too , the report is OOV to OOV an open OOV .
<P> I OOV it was important to make this clear , because it is not the first time that Parliament has made such OOV OOV in one of its reports .
OOV in OOV , when we OOV the OOV report , I OOV that it was OOV to OOV that there was any OOV OOV against OOV workers .
At that time the OOV OOV had made the OOV proposal that a OOV OOV be OOV for OOV of OOV OOV by OOV workers .
<P> It is important to OOV workers that there should be no OOV with the principle that OOV OOV and OOV OOV are OOV in the country of employment .
This is the OOV if OOV workers are to OOV all the social OOV that are OOV in the country of employment to workers who OOV there and to their OOV .
<P> That is how it is in OOV , and that is how it is OOV to be OOV - no more and no less .
<P> OOV for a resolution on environment OOV ( OOV ) <SPEAKER OOV LANGUAGE="FR" NAME=" OOV OOV " > OOV the OOV on OOV of OOV OOV , the OOV of OOV and OOV , and the OOV of OOV from OOV OOV are only OOV OOV in the Member States , this does not OOV by any means that these are OOV OOV which must be OOV , as some people in this House would OOV to have us believe .
<P> These OOV fully OOV up to the OOV of the citizens of Europe , who are OOV that greater attention be OOV to environmental OOV and are OOV OOV from the European authorities .
The great OOV of OOV and OOV OOV by the Committee on OOV OOV environmental OOV and OOV of these OOV OOV to these OOV .
<P> The fact is , if the OOV are only OOV OOV , it is because the Member States had not OOV the OOV when OOV them .
They had not taken on OOV the OOV of the financial costs or the amendments , which could be OOV , that these OOV would OOV in their OOV .
This is OOV both of the OOV OOV and the OOV OOV since they both OOV the OOV of agricultural and regional OOV OOV which may OOV OOV or OOV of OOV OOV .
<P> The implementation of the OOV OOV is OOV to provide OOV OOV for a European OOV of OOV OOV OOV OOV and to OOV them from future OOV in order to OOV OOV in OOV use or OOV to those OOV .
These OOV have , OOV , been very OOV OOV in the Member States , OOV OOV very OOV OOV between the OOV and OOV of these areas .
OOV there was no OOV of positive results in those OOV where OOV OOV was OOV , since the OOV OOV does indeed make it possible to support OOV management OOV by making OOV OOV available .
<P> This OOV OOV is OOV OOV in terms of regional OOV and OOV OOV in that it OOV the management and the use of OOV OOV OOV in order to make the best use of OOV .
OOV this end , the European Union must make every OOV to support the implementation of this directive .
<P> The European Union OOV must not OOV to the OOV interests which would OOV the very OOV of the directive .
<P> The Commission , as OOV of the OOV , must OOV OOV a OOV OOV with regard to the Member States in order to ensure that they OOV these OOV and , OOV , to OOV OOV against OOV to OOV these OOV even before they have been able to OOV their full OOV , particularly in the areas of OOV with OOV OOV in OOV and OOV and OOV the OOV of OOV OOV OOV .
<P> For the OOV OOV , the Group of the OOV OOV all the reports OOV , particularly the OOV report , which will OOV to OOV the implementation of the OOV OOV .
<P> The reason why we OOV , then , is that we do not feel that the OOV OOV to change the OOV of the report , OOV to OOV the OOV OOV and to OOV that it be OOV , are in OOV with OOV the OOV on which we are OOV .
<P> OOV report ( OOV ) <P> OOV ( OOV ) .
( OOV ) Mr President , I would be most OOV if you would OOV just a OOV of your attention , which I am OOV is in no OOV OOV , for the OOV of my vote for the OOV report on young farmers .
I would OOV the importance of OOV OOV by young farmers and of OOV the OOV at this difficult time for the OOV world .
I OOV a OOV from the OOV , OOV by the OOV OOV OOV with OOV OOV in the OOV OOV .
There was a OOV of OOV OOV all the OOV to OOV OOV .
OOV was extremely OOV and the OOV OOV to OOV the OOV to OOV OOV .
OOV then , I would like OOV OOV to be made to the European citizens now as well , so that farmers can OOV their OOV , which is , I OOV to say , under OOV from OOV OOV .
<SPEAKER OOV LANGUAGE="DE " OOV " > Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , the subject of the OOV report is the future of young farmers in the European Union .
OOV again we OOV OOV for new OOV , for OOV OOV aid .
I OOV against the report .
The report OOV the situation as if all were well with the OOV world .
But OOV is well with it .
OOV has OOV OOV on the OOV agricultural system .
We OOV OOV OOV OOV OOV of our OOV OOV on OOV every year .
That , indeed , OOV OOV of the European OOV .
We are OOV to ask OOV what we get in OOV for this OOV - OOV OOV , OOV OOV , OOV OOV and now the OOV OOV .
<P> I believe we are OOV OOV OOV by this OOV OOV we OOV and OOV OOV with OOV too .
OOV of OOV and OOV , we are OOV OOV with OOV of OOV OOV , OOV OOV and other OOV , and I believe this is OOV the point that must now be OOV in this OOV .
The use of OOV OOV and OOV in OOV OOV is the OOV OOV of a OOV agricultural policy , which OOV has to be OOV to an end right here and now .
We must OOV first OOV , so that these OOV OOV , the OOV of a OOV OOV , can be OOV to the OOV OOV .
That is OOV what we have to OOV the young farmers .
We must OOV about that with young farmers , about the fact that they will have to be able to OOV in the market without OOV .
This is certainly not the OOV of the report , which is why it must be OOV .
<SPEAKER OOV OOV NAME=" OOV " > .
( OOV ) The report by the Committee on OOV and OOV OOV is a OOV in the right OOV .
OOV funds are OOV to set young farmers up and OOV the OOV towards the OOV .
OOV farmers may be the OOV to OOV OOV areas , small OOV and OOV OOV from which the life OOV is OOV .
What we need is to use new OOV , such as the OOV , to OOV a new OOV , cultural , OOV OOV environment with a human OOV for them to work in .
<P> OOV important point not OOV in the OOV Committee report is that young farmers need to be given a basis on which to OOV OOV , OOV , OOV OOV , given that OOV OOV OOV OOV OOV to OOV OOV .
<SPEAKER OOV LANGUAGE="SV" NAME=" OOV , OOV , OOV OOV , OOV , OOV OOV and OOV " > - ( OOV ) We Swedish OOV OOV welcome many of the measures OOV by the Committee on OOV and OOV OOV in order to improve the situation for young farmers .
<P> We OOV believe that the OOV s agricultural OOV OOV to be OOV OOV and are therefore OOV to the OOV for an increase in the agricultural OOV , OOV in OOV OOV , OOV and OOV of Mr OOV ' s report .
<SPEAKER OOV LANGUAGE="FR" NAME=" OOV , OOV and OOV " > We are in favour of OOV young farmers without financial resources to OOV the OOV OOV involved in OOV up OOV , OOV OOV and OOV .
We therefore OOV in favour of this report in OOV of our OOV , for there is no OOV that the OOV , if not all of this aid will not go to the OOV of OOV OOV OOV and that , once again , those least well OOV will be OOV by the OOV .
At this OOV OOV , we would OOV the OOV of these funds to OOV the OOV of OOV OOV OOV .
<SPEAKER OOV NAME=" OOV " > .
I believe that the report from our Committee on OOV and OOV OOV is most OOV and should be OOV .
As a OOV of a OOV OOV , I am OOV aware of the concerns OOV by farmers over the very future of OOV in OOV .
It OOV OOV but it is OOV , that in OOV , where OOV has long been one of the economic OOV of the country , farmers are now OOV to OOV whether their OOV or OOV will be able to OOV on the OOV OOV .
<P> Mr OOV ' s report is very OOV , and the OOV on " The OOV of OOV OOV in the European Union " by OOV OOV which was OOV at his OOV at the OOV of last year OOV a OOV OOV on the whole issue .
<P> OOV farmers are an OOV part of the OOV future .
They OOV a very important role in the social life of OOV and OOV OOV , OOV a whole OOV of OOV and OOV in local OOV .
OOV help to OOV a OOV and OOV OOV by OOV the OOV .
<P> In OOV the OOV OOV OOV for OOV OOV a OOV OOV of measures which will OOV young farmers OOV on their OOV OOV .
These OOV a new OOV OOV of OOV OOV to OOV the OOV of OOV by OOV farmers and OOV young farmers as they first set up in OOV .
OOV OOV million has been OOV for this OOV , which I hope will OOV be OOV by the Commission .
<P> In OOV , a OOV OOV of OOV OOV are in place , OOV at OOV the OOV of OOV OOV .
These OOV OOV OOV OOV , OOV OOV , OOV OOV and OOV OOV .
<P> OOV with the OOV OOV OOV , it is clear that the OOV available to young farmers OOV out on a OOV in OOV will be of OOV OOV , and these measures should OOV in the OOV and more OOV OOV of OOV to OOV farmers .
<P> OOV young farmers taking over a OOV have to make necessary OOV OOV in order to OOV OOV OOV and to ensure the economic OOV of their OOV .
<P> In this regard some OOV OOV million have been OOV for OOV OOV under the OOV OOV OOV .
OOV OOV will OOV OOV OOV OOV , OOV in OOV OOV OOV and OOV and OOV OOV for OOV OOV .
<P> These OOV will be open to an OOV number of OOV and OOV farmers , including young OOV farmers , and will OOV to OOV the OOV of many farmers .
They will OOV in particular on young farmers .
<P> It should also be OOV that the OOV of these OOV OOV a clear OOV to the OOV of the environment , an issue which will OOV OOV in the future development of both OOV and European OOV .
<P> OOV OOV , it is OOV that we , at European level , OOV OOV towards OOV a future for European OOV .
The OOV OOV OOV has been a European OOV OOV , and we want to OOV it that way .
The future OOV with our young farmers and with agricultural OOV which are OOV and OOV the environment .
We must OOV our full support to these OOV .
<SPEAKER OOV OOV " NAME=" OOV " > .
( OOV ) The situation and the OOV of young farmers OOV a great deal on the situation and OOV of OOV in the EU itself .
As we all know , OOV and the OOV world are in OOV , a OOV in which the common agricultural policy has OOV a OOV part , OOV , as it does , OOV OOV , OOV of OOV , the OOV OOV of agricultural OOV , all of which OOV to OOV and OOV OOV , as OOV by a OOV in the number of those OOV and in the number of OOV of OOV OOV % and OOV % , OOV , since OOV .
<P> OOV farmers OOV the new OOV of OOV and are OOV to OOV the future of OOV in the various regions of the OOV
The OOV of OOV OOV % , in the last OOV , in OOV OOV OOV are under OOV years of OOV OOV the current OOV OOV .
<P> OOV measures for Community support for young farmers are therefore OOV , although the OOV problem OOV in the need for a OOV change in the OOV
The OOV report , with which I OOV agree , OOV its OOV of OOV , does not OOV on the necessary OOV to policy .
It OOV with the OOV framework .
OOV , three amendments which I OOV and which I believe to be important have been adopted .
These are : <P> the need to OOV OOV to OOV , OOV agricultural OOV , which OOV OOV which are OOV and have a high OOV OOV , through support for OOV OOV , support for OOV OOV and the OOV of OOV of OOV and the OOV of support OOV for regional OOV of OOV quality ; <P> OOV OOV for OOV development and OOV funds to support and OOV OOV public OOV OOV , OOV OOV and give a OOV to local OOV in the OOV world ; <P> the need to OOV and OOV legislation OOV young farmers .
<SPEAKER OOV NAME=" OOV " > The fact that we are OOV a report on the situation and OOV of young farmers in the European Union OOV very OOV OOV in the OOV of the OOV OOV .
<P> What has OOV since the well and OOV OOV OOV of the OOV in most of our Member States will OOV do OOV to OOV young people to OOV in OOV , OOV OOV OOV them to see their future in OOV areas , where , as the report so OOV OOV , they have a very important role to OOV in the social life of OOV and OOV OOV , OOV and OOV the OOV and OOV to the economic , social and environmental needs of the OOV , <P> We have greater OOV for concern about the future of OOV in the European Union than OOV before as a result of this OOV OOV OOV of OOV , given that the number of farmers under the OOV of OOV has been OOV the OOV OOV for some time and now OOV at OOV % and that the OOV of farmers in the OOV of OOV every Member State is OOV .
OOV report OOV all the most important and OOV OOV as well as all the OOV which have to be OOV if OOV OOV of young people are to continue to see their future in OOV .
<P> This is a OOV of OOV to which not only the European Commission but also the Council and all the Member States must OOV themselves if they want to OOV the OOV , OOV and OOV of OOV areas in the European Union and the OOV OOV of our social and cultural problems .
<P> In the EU we need OOV , OOV agricultural OOV .
We must OOV and OOV the OOV of OOV of our quality OOV , such as our OOV , in the OOV world , including the OOV OOV OOV , because our future in the European Union and that of our OOV trade OOV on OOV OOV , for which there is a OOV and OOV OOV market within and OOV the OOV of the Union .
<P> There is a OOV to put the OOV for the present problems , and especially for the OOV OOV , on the agricultural OOV , which is OOV to OOV OOV OOV OOV .
OOV I was a OOV of the OOV ' OOV Council of the European Commission for many years , I should also like to OOV here to the responsibility of OOV organisations , which , OOV of OOV ' OOV , have been OOV OOV for OOV OOV OOV for OOV .
OOV and again in the OOV and OOV , and more OOV too , they OOV out against the OOV of appropriate OOV OOV in the framework of the common OOV of the OOV in agricultural OOV .
So they too are OOV responsible for the OOV of OOV , for the fact that OOV have been OOV into OOV and that the right of farmers to OOV OOV OOV for their efforts has been OOV .
This has to be OOV in the present debate .
<P> I am an OOV OOV of this report , because it OOV and clearly OOV all the things that are right and important for the OOV of OOV OOV in Europe , without which there can be no support for OOV OOV with its OOV regional OOV , which OOV must OOV to OOV and for which they must be OOV to OOV a OOV OOV .
<SPEAKER OOV LANGUAGE="FR" NAME=" OOV " > It has been OOV that the situation of young farmers is a serious problem in the European Union and they do not have any real OOV OOV the support OOV by the Union and the Member States .
This is why I consider this report to be so important and why I am OOV that we have OOV in favour of it .
<P> The economic situation is OOV and OOV extremely serious , particularly for young people .
There is a real OOV of OOV for young farmers , as well as a OOV OOV in the OOV of farmers in general , with an increase in the OOV of those OOV .
<P> What can the European Union do ? <P> The Committee on OOV , OOV , OOV , the OOV and OOV , having been OOV to give its opinion on this subject , did not wish to OOV on OOV which OOV within the OOV of other OOV .
We therefore OOV to OOV the issues OOV with education , OOV and information OOV and the social and cultural life of young farmers .
<P> We OOV that young farmers OOV problems OOV from education and OOV that is often OOV OOV to their needs .
OOV OOV 2000 OOV these OOV important OOV .
<P> The European Union must OOV , through its OOV and OOV OOV , measures to OOV education and OOV OOV for young farmers in order to OOV their OOV to the OOV level .
OOV OOV must be set up .
OOV OOV must become a OOV , and young farmers must be able to become OOV with OOV OOV and OOV management systems so as to OOV their OOV OOV .
OOV may be OOV , in particular by OOV public services in OOV areas OOV , OOV OOV , transport services ) , and social OOV may be OOV by OOV the resources of OOV OOV , for example , or by OOV to the use of OOV services .
<P> If the right conditions for OOV OOV are OOV , then young OOV OOV OOV about OOV and OOV to improve their quality of life will be able to OOV in the country and OOV OOV will no OOV OOV the OOV OOV on to them by their OOV .
<SPEAKER OOV LANGUAGE="SV" NAME=" OOV " > - ( OOV ) The Swedish OOV OOV have OOV against the OOV report since we find it OOV with the principle of OOV , in OOV of the fact that the subject as such - the situation of young farmers - is of OOV importance .
<P> We especially OOV to OOV OOV in which the OOV proposal is made that the OOV should consider making it OOV for the Member States to provide OOV OOV of OOV aid to young farmers ' .
In our view , this is OOV not a OOV issue .
<P> OOV OOV report ( OOV ) <SPEAKER OOV OOV " NAME=" OOV " > Mr President , the OOV ' OOV , which I OOV at the European Parliament , OOV that the Commission , Parliament and the Council should change a major part of the fisheries policy and OOV upon them to do so .
The OOV in question is the part which OOV to the now OOV OOV of fishing the OOV of other countries and then OOV our OOV by OOV a OOV of OOV to the OOV OOV OOV we have OOV .
I have always been OOV to give to those who have not .
However , I am OOV that we OOV are not OOV OOV OOV but are going to OOV the OOV of OOV OOV .
I am quite aware of the problems of OOV , which we do have to OOV , but we must OOV them in some other way , not to the OOV of the OOV OOV only OOV is fishing .
<P> OOV report ( OOV ) <SPEAKER OOV NAME=" OOV " > Mr President , I wish to OOV by OOV , on behalf of my group , that we are very OOV in favour of OOV a form of common fisheries policy within the European Union , because we OOV that the management of resources is the best way forward for OOV OOV for the OOV of social and economic development in a OOV of OOV regions of the European Union , which would have no other OOV and could not get employment or other OOV OOV from their own OOV resources , for example fishing and OOV .
<P> However , that said and OOV OOV where OOV is OOV , we must also OOV that there are a OOV of OOV within the common fisheries policy .
In particular , the OOV OOV to having a OOV policy within the common fisheries policy is OOV .
This House has OOV that proposal again today .
OOV does not OOV OOV or OOV OOV from a Community OOV ; it means OOV OOV which are OOV each other and are fishing OOV OOV the opportunity to come together to OOV those OOV .
<P> On OOV of that , we must also put greater OOV on a OOV OOV system OOV all European Union OOV and give more OOV to the Community OOV to ensure that all OOV are being OOV OOV .
<P> Finally , I must say that there is a need for OOV .
We have OOV a OOV OOV in the fishing OOV within the European Union OOV .
The way to OOV OOV OOV is not by OOV to different OOV OOV and OOV them into a OOV system , but by OOV that we have certain OOV areas where we can OOV fishing OOV to OOV .
This example has already been OOV in certain areas by OOV OOV in OOV OOV and by OOV of these OOV areas - OOV OOV areas , to give the OOV with the common agricultural policy - for a certain OOV of time .
That is the one way of OOV that we can OOV a OOV OOV going , provide employment and OOV environmental OOV within our fishing OOV .
That is why we OOV the OOV report .
<SPEAKER OOV OOV " NAME=" OOV " > Mr President , I OOV for this report on the common fisheries policy , but I call upon the European Parliament , the Council and the Commission to OOV more OOV one of the OOV OOV to in OOV OOV of the report , which is OOV , OOV how and whether the OOV of the OOV and situation of the OOV in the fisheries sector and , in particular , in the OOV fishing sector , are OOV .
We have a responsibility to OOV to concern OOV , as well as with all the other important OOV of fisheries , with how the national States OOV OOV OOV , as they are the last to OOV OOV OOV in the area of OOV .
<SPEAKER OOV OOV NAME=" OOV " > .
( OOV ) OOV group OOV in favour of the resolution .
However , I must OOV one particular issue .
OOV to current Community legislation , OOV OOV have OOV fishing rights within a OOV of OOV OOV OOV , as OOV to the OOV OOV OOV which OOV to the other Member States of the EU , especially the Mediterranean countries .
This means that OOV OOV are not being OOV OOV and are at a OOV OOV with the other countries under the common fisheries policy .
<P> OOV that , OOV to the OOV in OOV OOV , OOV OOV of OOV OOV to the OOV OOV on the OOV of the OOV , the Community has OOV responsibility for OOV and OOV OOV OOV OOV and , by OOV , the OOV to OOV the OOV rules and OOV , the Commission should make use of these OOV and give OOV OOV OOV fishing rights within a OOV of OOV OOV OOV .
OOV , the European Parliament OOV in resolution OOV OOV ) for the Commission to OOV OOV the OOV fishing OOV to OOV OOV OOV in order to OOV a OOV OOV policy and OOV for the interests of OOV areas .
The Commission should OOV this resolution by the European Parliament .
<SPEAKER OOV LANGUAGE="FR" NAME=" OOV " > The OOV reports on which we are OOV to OOV our opinion OOV various OOV of the common fisheries policy , including the management and OOV of fisheries resources , OOV policy , the European Union ' s OOV relations on fishing , market OOV , OOV and OOV .
<P> The Commission has OOV the following OOV : OOV the OOV between the various OOV of the OOV , especially between the OOV of resources , economic OOV and employment in OOV regions ; greater OOV of the economic OOV of fishing ; OOV the OOV of environmental and fishing policy ; OOV OOV OOV , particularly OOV OOV OOV ; OOV a more OOV decision making process and OOV the OOV OOV of the OOV
<P> We can , of course , support all these points in principle .
I think it necessary , however , to OOV the following points which the Commission does not OOV to have OOV OOV .
OOV it is OOV that the OOV must be OOV OOV on an OOV OOV basis , OOV with workers in the sector must certainly be OOV at OOV level and must be OOV up .
The OOV of OOV must be involved at the OOV OOV OOV to the OOV ' OOV in order to increase OOV and to OOV decisions to be taken which are OOV and more OOV OOV .
OOV OOV will be even more OOV when the time OOV to OOV up OOV OOV .
OOV and OOV systems must OOV be OOV between the various fishing areas , in order to OOV OOV between Member States .
The system of OOV OOV out by Community countries on third country OOV OOV in Community OOV must be OOV .
<P> Finally , OOV OOV the OOV and OOV system at the OOV of the OOV , we wish to OOV the OOV we OOV to OOV the principle of OOV OOV and our OOV to the OOV of OOV .
<P> OOV report ( OOV ) <SPEAKER OOV OOV " NAME=" OOV " > Mr President , I OOV for this report for I - and the OOV ' OOV - consider that , before taking important decisions , the European Parliament - and not only Parliament but all the government OOV - should OOV the OOV , OOV and citizens concerned .
The OOV OOV that the Commission OOV a OOV number of OOV before taking a decision on the common fisheries policy : OOV of the OOV , OOV of the OOV which OOV OOV fishing and OOV of the fishing OOV OOV OOV .
It has OOV them all , OOV a OOV of OOV OOV .
That is all well and good , but has it also OOV the OOV , Mr President ?
<SPEAKER OOV LANGUAGE="FR" NAME=" OOV " > In OOV , OOV Europe , with its common fisheries policy , will be OOV .
OOV already OOV the end of one of the fisheries management OOV , the OOV OOV , or the OOV OOV OOV .
We have two years before OOV OOV OOV to consider and make a decision on a common policy which , OOV to the European Commission ' s OOV , OOV OOV OOV , OOV from OOV OOV to OOV OOV , the OOV and management of the market in OOV and OOV OOV to international fisheries OOV , OOV OOV into OOV OOV and the specific OOV of the Mediterranean .
<P> The OOV is being OOV , and even OOV , against a OOV , OOV OOV .
OOV , resources are OOV .
OOV such as OOV , OOV , OOV and OOV , are OOV or at OOV .
There is OOV .
OOV year , OOV , over OOV % of OOV OOV are OOV back into the OOV , particularly in the EU , on the OOV of OOV OOV or in order to respect OOV , OOV countries such as OOV make the most of OOV that OOV OOV the OOV OOV .
They make up OOV million OOV of the OOV OOV OOV of OOV million OOV .
<P> OOV and regional organisations are also concerned about fisheries management , from the OOV OOV and OOV OOV , and the OOV OOV Council for the Mediterranean , to the OOV OOV OOV fisheries OOV , in which the OOV OOV .
Europe has also OOV OOV OOV OOV with countries including OOV , the OOV and OOV and is OOV to come to an agreement with OOV , no OOV process and one that is OOV in OOV .
OOV OOV , OOV , and the OOV problem of OOV OOV , is now OOV the market .
<P> OOV , the OOV , which often OOV too many OOV OOV OOV , must OOV OOV OOV , OOV OOV . OOV OOV OOV , OOV to the OOV principle , OOV OOV OOV OOV and OOV which OOV OOV on the fishing industry for employment , as in the case of the OOV region .
OOV , we need a clear OOV that is OOV enough to take into account specific regional OOV , from the OOV OOV to the Mediterranean and even , as the OOV hope , those of the OOV or other OOV " OOV " .
<P> In particular , we must OOV the major OOV up of the European market , OOV OOV % of OOV , with the need to OOV our OOV , who see the OOV , OOV and OOV OOV OOV .
In order to OOV such OOV problems , the European Commission has used an OOV OOV that OOV OOV OOV of fisheries and environmental organisations as well as OOV .
<P> ( OOV OOV OOV OOV to OOV OOV of the OOV of OOV ) <P> OOV OOV for a resolution on depleted uranium <SPEAKER OOV NAME=" OOV " > Mr President , on behalf of my group I would like to welcome the OOV resolution which we have just OOV .
A OOV and OOV OOV OOV OOV for a OOV on the use of depleted uranium OOV is a positive OOV forward , even if it does not go as far as we would have OOV .
The OOV and OOV were OOV for a OOV OOV on the OOV , OOV and use of depleted uranium OOV and we believe that we have a legal as well as a OOV basis for OOV so .
The OOV OOV of OOV OOV OOV the use of certain OOV OOV ; the OOV resolution of the OOV on OOV Rights also OOV OOV depleted uranium OOV because of their OOV OOV .
The use of these OOV has already , therefore , been OOV in international law .
<P> We would also have been more OOV if the resolution had OOV our concerns about the OOV which is being used to OOV the OOV of depleted uranium .
A OOV number of OOV are now OOV the OOV OOV , which is OOV on OOV of OOV OOV OOV rather than OOV OOV or OOV OOV .
<P> OOV OOV that OOV from OOV OOV from the OOV OOV have been one OOV OOV more than OOV by the OOV OOV OOV OOV , which have OOV their OOV on OOV OOV .
The OOV of this OOV OOV the fact that even very OOV OOV of OOV , like that from depleted uranium , can in fact have OOV health OOV .
It is therefore OOV that we get this OOV right or OOV all the OOV and OOV in the world will be OOV OOV .
<P> Finally , I would like to OOV to the report on the OOV OOV of last OOV 's European OOV , which OOV that the new EU OOV OOV OOV is OOV OOV to use depleted uranium OOV .
OOV OOV this is a OOV OOV , which is OOV to use a OOV that will OOV an OOV OOV of OOV OOV the very OOV it is OOV to be there to OOV .
This is OOV OOV of OOV and must be OOV .
<SPEAKER OOV OOV " NAME=" OOV " > Mr President , I OOV against this OOV because I feel that there has been too much OOV at OOV in this issue .
I OOV , or rather , I OOV , that this is what OOV : <P> " Mr President , which OOV shall we use against OOV ? "
<P> " The OOV we OOV use OOV " OOV the President .
<P> " OOV OOV do we OOV use ? " OOV the general .
" OOV you OOV depleted uranium OOV as well ? " <P> " OOV , why not ? " said the President .
<P> " But , " the general OOV , " they can be extremely OOV to those who use them because they are OOV in OOV - we have OOV them . "
<P> " But , as you know , my OOV general , " OOV the President , OOV OOV OOV OOV and we must OOV these OOV as well . "
<P> Mr President , in OOV of OOV we have to make do , as they say .
I do not think we can be OOV at these OOV OOV , which could only have been OOV by having a OOV , OOV Europe .
<SPEAKER OOV NAME=" OOV OOV > Mr President , I OOV the OOV resolution on depleted uranium and I welcome the fact that Parliament OOV to OOV the OOV and the call for a OOV on these OOV .
I would have OOV a OOV resolution but I know how difficult it is to achieve that .
<P> What I do want to say , however , is that I OOV the OOV OOV by Mr OOV here this OOV .
At the same time as OOV he was in favour of OOV and OOV in OOV to this issue , he OOV that he only OOV to take action on it when it OOV a public issue about a OOV OOV , OOV his role as OOV of OOV during the OOV OOV .
OOV also OOV to OOV or to give a view on the question whether there OOV to be a OOV on these OOV .
I OOV also his OOV to make this Parliament OOV in the decision by OOV to use these OOV .
<P> The use of these OOV was OOV to the OOV that was being OOV by OOV , particularly in the OOV against OOV , and was therefore OOV and was a OOV OOV of the OOV on the OOV at OOV .
It was a OOV OOV of the OOV it would have on the OOV OOV , and indeed it was a OOV OOV of the OOV on aid workers and OOV OOV , both military and OOV , in the OOV of that OOV .
<P> I would OOV , as OOV have OOV , that the new OOV OOV OOV should not have available to it these OOV of OOV .
OOV I will be OOV on my own government in OOV to OOV to OOV in this OOV OOV OOV OOV there is a clear OOV that these OOV will not be used .
<SPEAKER OOV OOV NAME=" OOV " > .
( OOV ) OOV only OOV which the OOV OOV for a resolution on the " OOV OOV " OOV is to OOV up the OOV policy of OOV and the European Union which , on the OOV of OOV human rights , OOV OOV , OOV OOV OOV OOV and OOV OOV .
OOV to ensure that the OOV were even more OOV , they had no OOV about OOV OOV with depleted uranium OOV , OOV the fact that they were well aware of their OOV OOV OOV from the OOV against OOV .
<P> OOV the OOV OOV for a resolution OOV to OOV the OOV between OOV of OOV and OOV in OOV who OOV in the OOV OOV in OOV and OOV and during the OOV OOV and depleted uranium , it OOV itself to a wish OOV of OOV OOV and working parties and OOV OOV for the Member States who are OOV of OOV to OOV that the use of depleted uranium OOV be OOV and for OOV to OOV the OOV of OOV different OOV of OOV , in other words to continue OOV , but with " OOV " OOV .

We would , of course , be OOV OOV if we OOV OOV OOV to OOV themselves .
That OOV OOV to the people .
<P> The OOV OOV of OOV has OOV OOV both for a OOV on the use of depleted uranium and for the OOV OOV to OOV the OOV OOV and for OOV and the EU to OOV the OOV of OOV and OOV OOV and OOV up the environment .
<P> The OOV of the OOV OOV of OOV OOV against the OOV OOV for a resolution and call on the people to OOV and OOV their own OOV OOV to , and OOV their own OOV on , the OOV new order .
<SPEAKER OOV OOV NAME=" OOV , OOV , OOV and OOV " > - ( OOV ) The OOV OOV for a resolution OOV many OOV OOV but does not do OOV to the very difficult situation in which OOV has OOV the OOV OOV in the OOV , the OOV who were OOV there and their OOV .
OOV OOV OOV OOV have OOV from OOV , and the OOV is OOV .
OOV OOV in OOV were OOV against OOV in depleted uranium .
They were OOV against OOV OOV which might be OOV of having been in OOV with depleted uranium ; they were OOV upon to OOV areas OOV of having been OOV by OOV from depleted uranium OOV ; and they were OOV to OOV their OOV often .
We do not think that the OOV OOV OOV OOV of this OOV without good reason .
<P> There have also been a number of OOV OOV that OOV in depleted uranium is extremely OOV to health .
The OOV for the civil OOV in those areas OOV to military action by OOV have by no means been OOV OOV .
However , only the future will OOV the matter .
We therefore believe it is quite OOV OOV to OOV out another OOV into the OOV of OOV depleted uranium OOV .
We believe the matter has now been quite OOV OOV .
In our view , the OOV principle must , in any case , also OOV those who report for international OOV , as well as the civil OOV in OOV OOV .
These OOV should be OOV by the OOV of the OOV OOV OOV OOV and OOV OOV .
OOV OOV OOV to be OOV , and all OOV OOV .
We OOV an end to the use of depleted uranium OOV now .
<SPEAKER OOV LANGUAGE="FR" NAME=" OOV , OOV and OOV " > The fact that , for at least OOV years , the OOV of the most OOV countries have OOV about the OOV OOV of depleted uranium OOV , including the OOV on those OOV them , OOV that OOV OOV have as much OOV for their own OOV as they have for the OOV OOV and the OOV OOV .
<P> We have good OOV to be OOV at the OOV that OOV such OOV has had upon OOV OOV .
We have even more reason to be OOV at the OOV on the OOV OOV , the people who were OOV by depleted uranium OOV in just the same way as those OOV by OOV OOV .
<P> OOV , what should we make of the OOV OOV OOV by the OOV of all these political parties that OOV part in the decision to OOV OOV and OOV , the OOV of OOV did so after OOV the OOV OOV ?
They OOV OOV OOV a OOV hand and , today , OOV with the public ' s OOV , they are OOV to be concerned about the OOV of their decision OOV OOV to OOV their own OOV .
<P> We OOV in favour of the OOV OOV from the OOV Group of the European United OOV which OOV a OOV on the OOV , OOV , use and OOV of depleted uranium OOV " , even OOV we OOV that this would not OOV an OOV OOV into a " OOV OOV " .
<P> We OOV against the OOV resolution to OOV our OOV against the use of depleted uranium OOV , against OOV itself OOV it is used , but also against the OOV of the parties OOV such OOV .
<SPEAKER OOV LANGUAGE="FR" NAME=" OOV > The general public is particularly concerned about the OOV between the depleted uranium used in OOV and public health .
At the OOV of OOV , these OOV OOV OOV OOV , OOV OOV upon OOV , OOV and the environment are still not OOV .
OOV , uranium , even the depleted OOV which is OOV % less OOV than OOV uranium , is still a form of OOV OOV and OOV to use .
<P> There may be a OOV between the OOV of OOV OOV in OOV who have OOV in the OOV and the use of such OOV by OOV .
OOV OOV OOV OOV has not yet been OOV forward , and even if there is no OOV OOV OOV , what we have today is more than OOV OOV , as is OOV by the results of various OOV .
This concern is therefore well OOV and should not be OOV OOV .
<P> OOV we OOV OOV OOV , we should OOV the OOV principle and OOV a OOV on the use of such OOV .
This is the very least on which we can OOV today , before a OOV OOV is OOV , should the OOV OOV the OOV .
<P> OOV should be OOV open about the use of these OOV and about the OOV of its OOV in general , and the European Commission should itself OOV an OOV OOV OOV .
We OOV it to all the people who are OOV OOV or OOV under this OOV to OOV OOV and OOV .
<P> At a time when international law is OOV towards the OOV to OOV OOV on OOV OOV in OOV of human rights , the OOV OOV cannot be put at OOV by the OOV OOV OOV to OOV it .
<SPEAKER OOV LANGUAGE="FR" NAME=" OOV " > The OOV OOV OOV out our OOV concerns OOV this important issue , which OOV the health of OOV involved in OOV in difficult areas .
The local OOV involved OOV have a OOV interest in this , especially in OOV to the necessary OOV for the social , economic and environmental OOV of the OOV areas .
<P> In its OOV , therefore , the resolution is OOV and I fully support it .
<P> However , as it OOV , OOV OOV OOV too far , as it OOV , in OOV upon OOV OOV OOV to OOV a OOV , as the OOV principle is OOV in the OOV which OOV OOV to consider other OOV of OOV OOV the results of the OOV on depleted uranium are OOV .

( OOV ) We are OOV against the OOV OOV for a resolution that has been OOV because we cannot OOV that we are still OOV to OOV the OOV , OOV OOV . the serious OOV on the health of people in areas OOV by the use of OOV OOV depleted uranium .
OOV the OOV of the OOV OOV , which OOV at the time of the OOV OOV OOV , we have been aware of the OOV and the OOV when OOV with uranium and other OOV OOV because this is a OOV OOV OOV ( both OOV and OOV ) , when OOV or OOV and is also a OOV in OOV terms .
<P> The use of this OOV of OOV by the OOV and other OOV countries during the OOV OOV , in OOV and in OOV has already OOV the OOV of OOV of OOV , OOV and OOV for the OOV of areas that were OOV and the environmental OOV in OOV areas , with OOV - and OOV OOV , which will OOV not only the present OOV but also future OOV , which is OOV by the OOV OOV .
This OOV it quite clear that there is no such OOV as a " OOV OOV " .
<P> OOV , given the OOV of the OOV that has been OOV against whole OOV OOV , it is OOV that we OOV , OOV and OOV the OOV responsible for this OOV against OOV , and OOV OOV the OOV , OOV , use and OOV of this OOV of OOV OOV depleted uranium , not OOV OOV a OOV .
<SPEAKER OOV NAME=" OOV " > .
The OOV OOV of OOV OOV OOV the action taken by OOV OOV OOV to OOV the OOV of OOV and OOV OOV by OOV who OOV in the OOV .
<P> We believe that OOV of the use of depleted uranium should be OOV on OOV fact .
We OOV that as yet there is no OOV to OOV depleted uranium and OOV health OOV OOV by OOV or OOV .
<P> For that reason , we do not believe that it is appropriate at this time to call for a OOV on the use of depleted uranium OOV .
<SPEAKER OOV LANGUAGE="FR" OOV and OOV > OOV the OOV of the OOV OOV of depleted uranium OOV really come as a OOV ?
We all know that these OOV , used by OOV during the OOV OOV ( OOV ) , and the OOV in OOV ( OOV ) and OOV ( OOV ) had serious OOV , OOV , for the OOV OOV that was OOV , for their environment , and for the OOV there , whether OOV , OOV , OOV , OOV or OOV OOV .
For a long time , the military and political authorities OOV OOV OOV on OOV who OOV concern about this matter .
OOV and then OOV OOV had to get OOV before the OOV was OOV OOV , following the OOV OOV of an OOV .
There is no such OOV as a OOV OOV .
<P> The OOV OOV of OOV OOV involved in OOV should OOV us to get right to the OOV of the OOV of the government and OOV OOV , OOV Mr OOV , the OOV OOV of OOV .
We must OOV a OOV on the OOV , OOV , use and OOV of depleted uranium OOV .
We are in favour of OOV an international OOV and , in the OOV OOV , we OOV a programme for the OOV OOV of OOV who have taken part in OOV in the OOV , OOV of OOV organisations who have OOV in the field and the people OOV in the areas in question .
<SPEAKER OOV NAME=" OOV " > .
I OOV for the OOV on OOV OOV depleted uranium .
OOV I would have OOV a OOV OOV in view of the very high OOV that they OOV OOV OOV to health .
<P> I further OOV them on account of their OOV OOV on the human and OOV environment more OOV .
I particularly wish to OOV OOV concern about the environmental OOV that is OOV certainly being OOV by OOV OOV at the OOV OOV on the OOV OOV .
These OOV already OOV OOV OOV of OOV OOV from OOV .
<SPEAKER OOV OOV NAME=" OOV " > Mr President , after all the OOV OOV which OOV during the OOV of OOV and the OOV about the use of depleted uranium OOV , the OOV priority today is to OOV this OOV of OOV , which has OOV OOV both the second it is OOV and for a long time OOV , and which is OOV , OOV OOV . which OOV no OOV between those who are at OOV of OOV its OOV .
We also need , OOV OOV , to OOV a OOV OOV , OOV and OOV policy for the whole of OOV OOV by the use of this OOV , in order to OOV public health and the environment , OOV up the OOV and the OOV and OOV the OOV development of the country and the region in general .
The OOV OOV for a resolution under OOV does not OOV OOV the first OOV , but it does have the OOV of OOV for a OOV on the use of these OOV .
As for the second OOV , a few general , OOV OOV are made to OOV OOV programmes which , however you look at it , are of OOV OOV , OOV there OOV to be no OOV of any OOV to OOV in new , OOV OOV at the level of real needs , as OOV OOV .
<P> For the OOV , the OOV for a resolution OOV - with a few OOV OOV - to very serious OOV , such as the OOV of and the need for OOV into depleted uranium , but OOV no OOV OOV of the OOV efforts being made to OOV and OOV the OOV , OOV OOV which we all know about and even OOV OOV OOV by OOV countries on the OOV of depleted uranium and the OOV measures which they themselves OOV on their OOV .
<P> It is for these OOV that I am OOV to vote in favour of the OOV for a resolution .
I shall OOV a OOV OOV OOV because the call for a OOV on the use of depleted uranium may be a positive OOV in the right OOV , not that this means that OOV , OOV OOV OOV and other OOV , OOV OOV will OOV .
In all OOV , OOV efforts must be made and a OOV OOV OOV Europe and the whole world must OOV to OOV about a OOV OOV on all these OOV , OOV OOV a OOV to the OOV and OOV of the OOV OOV of OOV and the world .
<P> Finally , I wish to state that I am OOV by the political OOV of hand during our debate : just as we were OOV in the OOV of OOV OOV and the OOV by OOV OOV 's policy , now Mr OOV OOV us , in our OOV of the use of depleted uranium , of OOV the human rights of OOV 's OOV .
In both OOV , OOV with a OOV of OOV on the matter at issue will OOV the OOV of OOV and OOV with the OOV , which is the OOV to any OOV of OOV or OOV .
<P> OOV on OOV <SPEAKER OOV LANGUAGE="FR" NAME=" OOV > Mr President , the Union for a Europe of OOV Group OOV in favour of the resolution on OOV OOV .
It OOV without OOV that we OOV OOV the OOV OOV by the OOV OOV in OOV OOV since OOV .
The OOV for human OOV that has been OOV is OOV more than the result of the OOV OOV on which OOV in particular and OOV OOV in general are OOV .
This group OOV the hope that OOV OOV will in the OOV future OOV a policy of OOV OOV that is an OOV OOV for peace .
<P> In this respect , we are OOV that both OOV and OOV OOV have been on better terms for some time now .
This OOV to find peace is a OOV of great hope for OOV of OOV that have been OOV for OOV a OOV .
We must do all we can to OOV this change .
<P> OOV , we can but OOV the OOV , OOV in the resolution , to OOV the OOV of OOV relations with OOV OOV to the European Union rather than to Member States .
OOV we OOV you that OOV is one of the OOV OOV of every OOV state ?
OOV state is OOV to OOV OOV relations with any other .
OOV OOV should be able to OOV the OOV to OOV the OOV policy of its OOV , the one most OOV to its political and economic interests .
However , I OOV OOV that the Community OOV , OOV as they are with OOV but OOV OOV , are OOV enough to deal with the OOV .
<SPEAKER OOV NAME=" President " > That OOV OOV time .
<P> ( The OOV was OOV at OOV OOV and OOV at OOV OOV ) OOV OOV Council OOV for the meeting of the United OOV OOV Rights Commission in OOV <SPEAKER OOV NAME=" President " > The next OOV is the Council and Commission OOV on the Council OOV for the meeting of the United OOV OOV Rights Commission in OOV .
<SPEAKER OOV LANGUAGE="SV" NAME=" OOV " > Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , Members of the European Commission , I am very OOV that , at an OOV OOV in the Swedish Presidency , the opportunity has already been OOV to debate this important issue OOV the OOV for the OOV meeting with the OOV OOV Rights Commission .
In the course of the debate , I shall , of course , OOV OOV the points of view put forward and OOV the OOV of the OOV before the OOV OOV to OOV the OOV s position .
<P> The presidency ' s OOV in the OOV to this year ' s OOV is to OOV the EU OOV agreed OOV , to OOV the OOV countries to back the OOV s OOV and OOV and , as far as at all possible , to OOV general support for the proposals - especially , this year , OOV the OOV in OOV and OOV .
For OOV OOV , it is still OOV quite how the OOV Rights Commission ' s OOV OOV on the situation in the OOV OOV , OOV last OOV , is to be OOV up .
What is , however , clear is that the issue may be OOV to become one of the OOV issues during this year ' s OOV and that the EU will be one of the OOV OOV .
<P> In OOV of last year , the Council OOV an OOV of the OOV s human rights OOV with OOV .
The OOV are OOV to be adopted at the Council ' s meeting at the end of OOV .
These will OOV the OOV of the OOV and OOV the OOV to be taken both by the OOV itself and by the OOV OOV of the OOV of the OOV .
<P> It is still OOV whether a resolution on OOV is to be adopted in this year ' s OOV .
The EU is in OOV OOV with the United States , which was last year ' s OOV .
The same OOV to another issue that has OOV attention in the OOV Rights Commission , OOV the resolution OOV the human rights situation in OOV , for which the OOV OOV and OOV OOV responsibility last year .
<P> OOV the OOV on particular OOV , the EU will , in the future too , take responsibility for the OOV OOV the rights of the OOV and the OOV OOV .
OOV women ' s rights are concerned , the OOV Rights Commission will be OOV upon a number of OOV to which the EU is OOV OOV , even OOV they are not EU OOV .
It is as yet OOV what OOV will be OOV from the EU when it OOV to the OOV Rights Commission ' s resolution OOV the OOV OOV OOV OOV , OOV the EU 's OOV in the OOV for this OOV OOV will OOV be one of the OOV OOV during this OOV OOV .
<P> The OOV OOV resolution on the rights of the OOV , OOV in cooperation with the OOV OOV group , has OOV become so OOV that it has become OOV OOV to deal with .
It is therefore the OOV s OOV to OOV the OOV of the resolution to a OOV and , in the process , make the rights OOV OOV .
This OOV is OOV by the OOV to make a OOV contribution to the OOV for the OOV s OOV OOV on OOV in OOV OOV .
<P> OOV in OOV to the OOV OOV is a priority issue for the OOV s common OOV policy within the area of human rights , as may OOV be OOV from the OOV s OOV adopted in OOV .
OOV important OOV of this work is the OOV Rights Commission ' s resolution OOV the OOV OOV .
The OOV , this year too , is to achieve as OOV support as possible for this resolution .
<P> OOV important OOV for the OOV s OOV OOV in issues OOV human rights is good OOV to OOV information .
In this area , the EU countries ' and the Commission ' s OOV OOV the world have an important role to OOV when it OOV to OOV information .
OOV cooperation with OOV organisations is a OOV OOV , as is cooperation with regional organisations .
OOV but not least , the EU will continue to give every support to the OOV s OOV Commissioner for OOV Rights .
<SPEAKER OOV NAME=" OOV > Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , on behalf of my OOV , Mr OOV , who had to OOV to go to OOV for a meeting , I should like to OOV Parliament for OOV this debate today , because it OOV us a OOV opportunity for an OOV of OOV on the OOV Commission on OOV Rights .
<P> It is important that the OOV of Parliament are taken into account , as the European Union OOV towards OOV OOV on the main issues which will be OOV in OOV .
OOV OOV on the OOV in OOV will only be OOV OOV after OOV negotiations , which are , of course , an OOV part of the process .
<P> OOV and OOV are right to OOV the OOV of OOV and OOV of the OOV .
OOV of the presidency , the Commission services and OOV Member States OOV a meeting of the OOV Rights OOV Group OOV in OOV on OOV OOV .
A OOV OOV of OOV OOV an opportunity to set out their OOV with regard to OOV country and OOV concerns and this OOV will no OOV OOV OOV to the OOV process .
<P> The OOV Commission on OOV Rights of last year OOV had its high and OOV points .
The OOV of the resolution OOV by the European Union on the OOV OOV was a welcome OOV .
The European Union may OOV this OOV this year , OOV the fact that the issue OOV of OOV concern .
<P> The Swedish Presidency has OOV more OOV that the efforts made by the European Union in OOV with the OOV OOV will be OOV and OOV .
<P> There was OOV at the OOV of a OOV OOV on OOV .
OOV OOV of the OOV Rights Commission OOV against , making clear that such OOV can only OOV to OOV OOV and OOV the very OOV OOV OOV of the OOV .
<P> As I have OOV , decisions OOV EU OOV for this year 's OOV Commission in OOV have not been OOV , as is OOV for this OOV of the process .
<P> The presidency and Member States are OOV the situation in OOV countries , taking into account , where appropriate , the information from the United OOV ' OOV OOV and other OOV available .
<P> I will OOV OOV OOV on some issues of interest which , whether or not they form part of an EU initiative , will OOV be OOV of OOV for those OOV the OOV Commission .
<P> OOV concerns OOV with respect to OOV , concerns which continue to be OOV as part of the OOV OOV .
OOV OOV in recent OOV OOV the OOV of a OOV of OOV on human rights with the United OOV OOV Commissioner last OOV .
<P> It is OOV OOV that OOV OOV to OOV change , a point OOV by the European Union in OOV last year .
OOV this in OOV , the human rights OOV with OOV is OOV the OOV of an OOV OOV which will OOV to the OOV of OOV by the OOV OOV OOV Council .
They will form the basis for OOV forward the OOV in a OOV and OOV OOV .
<P> As OOV OOV , the resolution adopted at the OOV OOV of the OOV OOV in OOV OOV OOV the positive OOV in that country .
However , it also OOV , with concern , OOV OOV with regard to the OOV of OOV , the use of OOV and OOV and OOV OOV against OOV OOV and women .
<P> The OOV report OOV to the OOV OOV last OOV by Mr OOV , the OOV OOV , OOV the need to OOV the progress towards OOV human rights .
OOV by the OOV OOV OOV , of course , a OOV OOV .
<P> Finally , as a OOV concern , OOV 's issues will OOV OOV much attention this year , not least at the OOV OOV of the United OOV OOV OOV OOV for OOV .
OOV this in OOV , the European Union will continue to OOV an OOV role in the resolution on OOV 's rights at OOV and , as last year , will OOV the OOV cooperation of the OOV OOV and the OOV group .
<SPEAKER OOV NAME=" OOV " > Mr President , I would like to OOV the OOV and the Commissioner for their OOV .
In particular for what they have had to say about the OOV OOV and the situation in OOV and OOV .
<P> I only OOV that the OOV OOV was not mentioned by OOV OOV because it OOV to me that the situation in OOV is OOV .
This needs to be OOV by the Commission in particular if we are to look towards a OOV human rights situation in Europe as a whole .
OOV any OOV the OOV will be good and Mr OOV will be able to OOV certain OOV with the OOV President .
<P> It is very OOV that this matter should come up because it is OOV OOV years since the OOV of the OOV Union .
At that time we had very high OOV that the whole of Europe would become a human OOV OOV but of course things OOV OOV out OOV as one OOV .
The situation in particular in OOV has OOV OOV and there have been the most OOV civil OOV and OOV on a OOV OOV in the OOV .
<P> We must OOV OOV in Europe on some progress but not enough has been OOV .
I am particularly OOV to see what has OOV in OOV , OOV and the OOV OOV .
The human rights situation in those countries has OOV OOV and in the OOV States with the OOV of the OOV economic system .
OOV people do not consider that to be a human right , but I believe in fact that it is and OOV another OOV forward that we should welcome .
<P> It OOV me very OOV every OOV to see in the OOV of the Mediterranean and OOV OOV OOV of OOV from OOV and OOV Europe including OOV OOV in the way that we have done for many OOV .
It is , as a OOV OOV OOV , OOV OOV , used to say , the main OOV of a OOV policy to OOV citizens to be able to OOV with a OOV of OOV OOV and OOV .
<P> I believe OOV that I should OOV two or three of the particular problems of OOV .
OOV of them is one in which I have a OOV interest , OOV the question of OOV , and the OOV OOV system of OOV .
I hope that Mr OOV is well OOV on the question of the present OOV of the OOV of OOV , Mr OOV OOV .
OOV is rather OOV in his OOV OOV OOV in OOV .
I find it OOV that the OOV OOV are OOV a OOV made by the OOV OOV in this way .
<P> The OOV on OOV OOV on the part of Mr OOV .
OOV OOV not to have a OOV of OOV .
OOV does not like to see OOV OOV on the OOV by a OOV OOV with OOV being made at his OOV .
It OOV that it is not appropriate for the President of OOV to be OOV in this way and so he will not OOV it .
It is a most OOV OOV made all the more OOV by the fact that one OOV is OOV the support of the President of OOV .
This is not OOV and I hope it will be OOV with during Mr OOV 's OOV .
<P> OOV OOV , the other points I would OOV in respect of OOV are the situation in the OOV OOV , in particular in OOV , but also OOV because the OOV OOV is OOV these OOV for the OOV which it OOV and in particular the OOV of its young OOV OOV .
I have also OOV with concern in the OOV year the OOV of the present OOV of OOV - many of OOV are OOV because they were OOV by a OOV OOV in the OOV - to be a OOV OOV OOV in the OOV of OOV OOV , OOV and OOV OOV .
This is really something that is quite OOV I would have OOV in the OOV OOV environment .
<P> So , with those OOV I OOV the Commission and the OOV and look forward to an OOV in human rights in the OOV year .
<SPEAKER OOV NAME=" OOV " > Mr President , last year I OOV the OOV OOV OOV Rights Commission in OOV and last OOV , I OOV the OOV Rights OOV Group : much more needs to be done and , if OOV , the situation is OOV OOV the world .
<P> The OOV and OOV of human rights is a high priority for the European Union and OOV one of the OOV OOV of the Union .
OOV , I believe the OOV of human rights should OOV OOV we do in the OOV of democracy because a OOV human rights situation is often OOV or OOV by the OOV of democracy and OOV and OOV government OOV .
OOV rights do not OOV in OOV , OOV should they be OOV in OOV .
They are the OOV rights of all people OOV of who they are , where or to OOV they are OOV .
OOV as we OOV in this OOV , the human rights of OOV , women and OOV are being OOV .
<P> This is why the Council and the Member States must work for the OOV OOV of the main human rights OOV available to all countries , in particular , the OOV OOV on OOV and OOV Rights , the OOV on OOV , OOV and OOV rights , the OOV on the OOV of all OOV of OOV against OOV , the OOV on the Rights of the OOV , already mentioned , the OOV on the OOV of all OOV of OOV OOV and the extremely important OOV against OOV .
We also call for OOV measures to be taken to OOV OOV OOV from OOV and OOV OOV to which they are still OOV : because of their OOV , they still OOV the OOV OOV in certain OOV of the world .
<P> We also call on the EU to support the OOV OOV Commissioner for OOV Rights and the other international organisations and OOV in the OOV against OOV of the OOV OOV already OOV to by OOV OOV and the OOV of OOV and OOV and to OOV all OOV to end OOV , to OOV the right of OOV to OOV information and to OOV the OOV on OOV to OOV information OOV , often a OOV to people being OOV .
<P> We also call upon the Council and the OOV Commission on OOV Rights to give full support to the OOV of the OOV OOV on the OOV of OOV OOV from OOV OOV .
OOV again , and I hope not in OOV , we call for the OOV of the OOV OOV .
<P> OOV can , will and should be OOV and OOV , but in this House and together with the Council and the OOV Commission , we must OOV our efforts to ensure that OOV , women and OOV are OOV OOV and can OOV as OOV , OOV the OOV OOV of human rights .
That is the OOV that this House must OOV to the OOV Commission on OOV Rights in OOV and I hope OOV in this House will support such an OOV .
<SPEAKER OOV LANGUAGE="SV" NAME=" OOV " > Mr President , OOV of the Council , Commissioner , the European Union is an important OOV of OOV OOV for democracy , OOV and human rights .
This is the basis not only for our OOV work but also for our OOV policy .
In many OOV , the EU has a good policy on human rights .
What , however , is OOV is a OOV and OOV OOV for the way in which the work on OOV this is to be OOV out .
The various OOV are not always OOV and there is a OOV of OOV and OOV , and this , of course , OOV our OOV .
<P> OOV to the OOV in OOV , I and the Group of the European OOV , OOV and OOV OOV hope for a OOV and OOV Europe which will OOV OOV a number of issues .
It was good to OOV of the OOV of the Swedish Presidency here today .
<P> It is good that the Council OOV the resolution on the OOV OOV and on the rights of the OOV and of women .
On behalf of the Group of the European OOV , OOV and OOV OOV , I would also call upon the Council to support the OOV up of OOV to the OOV OOV OOV , as well as to support a new international OOV OOV those who have OOV .
The issue of OOV must also be OOV .
<P> OOV of human rights OOV in many countries .
These must always be OOV , and when they OOV in EU countries too .
In certain countries , the situation is OOV , however .
I really want to OOV to the Council to OOV to OOV about a resolution on OOV , where OOV against OOV citizens are OOV OOV and OOV , especially OOV against OOV OOV OOV , which has been OOV up .
<P> The OOV of the Council mentioned OOV and OOV .
I should also like to OOV OOV OOV , OOV , OOV and OOV .
In these countries , too , the situation is very OOV .
<P> OOV the OOV and the EU are important OOV in the international debate .
OOV countries OOV and take OOV of OOV from ' OOV ' .
We can make use of this position to OOV OOV for human rights .
It OOV OOV , OOV and a more OOV OOV out OOV .
I hope that the Swedish Presidency can help OOV such a OOV , not only OOV to OOV but also for the future , which is a OOV OOV for the OOV s OOV policy .
<SPEAKER OOV NAME=" OOV > Mr President , human rights are an OOV part of the basis of human OOV and law in the Union .
They are also OOV OOV , OOV certain OOV in OOV .
However , the EU will have no human rights OOV OOV the responsibility OOV to OOV OOV with the Member States .
As there is no OOV , OOV then become the OOV .
OOV human rights that means that political OOV might OOV where and when to OOV when OOV are OOV .
OOV some OOV that is OOV .
<P> A OOV OOV on respect for , and OOV of , human rights , such as the EU , should , however , be able to achieve a more OOV , OOV policy on human rights than is the case at present .
It would be OOV if the Union had a common OOV in this important area .
For that reason the opportunity we now have well OOV to OOV the Council ' s OOV in the OOV meeting of the United OOV OOV Rights Commission is a welcome one .
<P> OOV rights OOV must be taken OOV at all OOV and not just when a political OOV is OOV .
OOV rights have OOV OOV , which OOV OOV when they are used as a OOV to achieve other , OOV quite OOV OOV in themselves , in OOV OOV , or when OOV OOV are OOV OOV about for OOV , or other , OOV .
This is a OOV that can also be OOV in our approach to the OOV on the OOV Rights Commission ' s OOV , OOV , OOV and with regard to the issues themselves .
For example , OOV of the OOV of OOV or OOV with the OOV going OOV , which OOV OOV has OOV OOV against , OOV to be OOV into more OOV .
<P> OOV OOV action is not enough , then , but OOV must human rights OOV be a OOV OOV present OOV , like a political OOV ' , with no real OOV OOV .
For the OOV s OOV to OOV further and more OOV it must have a OOV policy , one that is OOV its own , and must OOV up its work in this area .
OOV cooperation should therefore become more OOV in the future and the role of the European Parliament in particular should be made more OOV .
OOV all , we here in Parliament should also OOV and OOV our OOV OOV .
That means OOV , OOV OOV in human rights work when it is not OOV OOV with OOV to be OOV or current OOV OOV by the OOV .
We have to make the OOV and OOV process more OOV , which will OOV not only good will but also OOV resources and OOV OOV .
OOV organisations and civil OOV are OOV of OOV help .
They can also OOV a OOV of OOV OOV to that OOV in which we OOV about far too much with OOV of only rather OOV , OOV interest .
<SPEAKER OOV OOV NAME=" OOV " > Mr President , Mr OOV , OOV of the Council , in OOV a resolution on a subject like human rights , there are in fact two OOV : we can state OOV and OOV OOV specific areas ; or we can do as we have in fact done , OOV OOV a number of specific areas and so OOV the OOV of OOV some things .
That is OOV what this OOV is about .
However , I want first of all to say that I am very OOV indeed that something about the situation in OOV has been OOV , and I want OOV to support the amendments OOV .
OOV OOV OOV also to have been OOV about the situation OOV OOV OOV for the OOV OOV OOV , but it was not .
There is OOV some quite OOV OOV , and I am very OOV about that .
I am also OOV that OOV has been mentioned .
I think this is an area to which we do not OOV enough attention .
It is an area which may yet become a OOV OOV for security policy in that area , and OOV also in our own area .
<P> There are some areas to which I think too OOV priority has been given .
The Swedish Presidency OOV that it will give high priority to the work done towards OOV the OOV OOV .
I am extremely OOV about that , and I very much agree that this is an area to which high priority should be given .
In this OOV , we need to OOV our OOV on our OOV OOV .
I think we have to be aware of the situation in the United States .
OOV the OOV OOV OOV , the number of OOV OOV OOV out in the United States will OOV OOV OOV .
We are in a situation in which there are people on OOV OOV in the United States who , we are quite OOV , have not been given OOV OOV , OOV who will in fact be given OOV OOV OOV OOV OOV help them , for the system will not of itself OOV these .
I also think we have to OOV another of our OOV ' , OOV OOV - an OOV country - which we do not OOV at all in this resolution .
It is a problem that we still have a country so OOV to us which will not OOV the OOV OOV , which will not OOV general OOV rights for OOV OOV and which has not OOV OOV over the OOV its OOV use , OOV on the OOV or in its OOV .
OOV does not OOV with the OOV OOV OOV .
OOV OOV a OOV Europe , we are not OOV much to help those people who OOV from countries of that OOV , and OOV me , in OOV , to say to the Swedish Presidency , ' OOV , we do not improve the situation of OOV by OOV a OOV Europe OOV OOV . ' <SPEAKER OOV LANGUAGE="FR" NAME=" OOV " > Mr President , Mr OOV of the Council , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , I believe that the OOV of our OOV OOV are clear .
Mrs OOV and Mrs OOV have just OOV on the subject of OOV .
OOV OOV OOV about OOV .
<P> However , Mr OOV of the Council , you OOV to the Union ' s OOV position .
We know from OOV that the Union ' s OOV position is the OOV that you have come up with in order to OOV OOV any serious position in OOV .
We already OOV this last year , when the Union OOV OOV the United States and other countries OOV the last OOV in order to OOV OOV any real initiative on OOV and on the OOV ' s OOV of OOV .
<P> OOV , I OOV that my own OOV , the OOV OOV , will again this year be one of the only parties , OOV with OOV OOV and a few OOV , to OOV up for the issue of human rights in OOV and OOV ; who will OOV the issue of OOV to the OOV , OOV the Council , and the European Union which it OOV , will again be OOV from the United OOV .
You will be working on the matter of the OOV OOV , OOV full well that this issue today concerns the United OOV OOV OOV and the Commission on OOV Rights and , OOV , once again you will be OOV OOV OOV OOV in , if I may say so , a rather OOV OOV .
<SPEAKER OOV OOV " OOV OOV " > Mr President , in OOV OOV on the human rights situation I have OOV OOV that the European Union should take more OOV action and OOV more OOV to OOV .
It therefore OOV me OOV not to OOV OOV the presidency or the Commission OOV a OOV about the human rights situation in OOV just now in the OOV .
<P> That is why I shall make OOV to start out by OOV attention to a OOV OOV situation , and one which is OOV very OOV on the human rights OOV , OOV the situation in OOV following the OOV of President OOV .
OOV OOV , and often OOV information , it is OOV OOV on us that there is a OOV of a OOV OOV OOV in OOV .
That is why it is so important to OOV and OOV OOV the new OOV to do all they OOV can to OOV OOV and OOV in OOV and to respect human rights .
<P> At the same time , I believe all those countries that are involved in the conflict , be it OOV or OOV , must be OOV in no OOV terms not to OOV in the current OOV OOV .
If the OOV countries do not OOV OOV then the OOV could OOV further , with all the OOV this might OOV .
It is important for the OOV of the OOV peace process to be OOV up OOV OOV , and for the OOV OOV to be able to start , with the cooperation of all concerned .
I say that with the OOV OOV of OOV in OOV , when the international OOV had to OOV the OOV of OOV of OOV of people , which OOV me to OOV for more OOV from the European Union , and greater OOV , also on the part of the OOV , where OOV OOV is concerned .
<P> This OOV me to the OOV of the OOV OOV Rights Commission in OOV .
OOV the OOV OOV and OOV , the rights of women , OOV and other OOV OOV are still being OOV on a OOV OOV .
OOV the world , one OOV in three OOV OOV OOV .
OOV million OOV work in OOV conditions and two million OOV OOV the OOV of OOV are OOV into OOV every year .
<P> I would like to ask that OOV attention be given to two OOV of human rights OOV that have taken on OOV OOV in Europe over the last few years .
OOV , there is the OOV of OOV and OOV OOV .
OOV we OOV OOV OOV countries because they OOV OOV OOV , or OOV countries because of their OOV OOV , we are OOV OOV here in OOV Europe by OOV and OOV OOV OOV .
<P> I would like to OOV your attention to the excellent report by Mr OOV on the subject .
OOV new OOV OOV how serious the situation is .
A OOV of people OOV OOV of OOV and OOV of OOV with OOV OOV the OOV was OOV up in OOV OOV .
OOV OOV , the OOV OOV OOV in OOV the OOV OOV down , OOV OOV OOV OOV OOV of OOV in the process .
<P> A second OOV OOV is that of OOV in human OOV .
OOV year , OOV OOV million or so people are OOV into other countries , OOV a million of OOV end up in the European Union .
OOV in human OOV has become a very OOV international industry , often OOV the OOV of the OOV .
So many OOV of OOV OOV get OOV up on OOV OOV that it has OOV OOV a OOV debate as to who should OOV for the OOV .
In both OOV , the OOV of OOV people is being OOV by OOV OOV .
In both OOV there is a need for information to be OOV in the countries of OOV , and for OOV between international OOV OOV , in a OOV to OOV these OOV .
<P> OOV has a good OOV when it OOV to OOV human rights in the world .
I really hope that OOV will do its OOV full OOV over the next OOV OOV and put all its efforts into the OOV that Parliament has OOV in these two important areas .
<SPEAKER OOV LANGUAGE="FR" NAME=" OOV " > Mr President , the OOV Commission on OOV Rights is not just a OOV OOV but also an OOV OOV for the OOV and OOV of human rights .
OOV , the OOV of the Commission and the OOV OOV between OOV OOV who have OOV respect for human rights often OOV us OOV OOV , OOV OOV , or even any OOV at all .
However , the very fact that a serious OOV of human rights in a United OOV OOV state should be mentioned at OOV is really a political fact in itself .
The countries on the OOV end of the OOV OOV OOV OOV " and are OOV OOV in OOV to OOV any OOV , and this is OOV where the European Parliament , being so OOV to the OOV of human rights , can fully OOV its part .
In OOV with the OOV OOV , and particularly with OOV OOV and the human rights OOV , Parliament can OOV the Council and Member States in order to OOV that , in OOV , the OOV present OOV common OOV on priority issues .
<P> For OOV , the priority issues that I believe should be OOV in OOV are , first and OOV , the OOV OOV , OOV , OOV of OOV against women , OOV to respect OOV ' s rights , OOV of the OOV and OOV of information .
OOV recent OOV of human rights OOV , the OOV of OOV or OOV OOV , often OOV by OOV , are particularly OOV .
The OOV are OOV always political OOV of the OOV in OOV .
These OOV , against which there is no possible OOV , have been OOV in the OOV OOV ( in OOV to OOV ) , in OOV OOV , OOV , OOV , OOV and OOV , in Palestinian OOV OOV by OOV and in OOV , OOV other OOV .
I could go on and on .
This OOV is long but it is not OOV .
<P> Parliament will do itself OOV by OOV that the OOV of Europe OOV a OOV position on this issue .
We have just OOV the new OOV of OOV Rights .
We must OOV in OOV with our OOV .
The OOV ' OOV are OOV our action .
<SPEAKER OOV OOV OOV " > Mr President , it is more than OOV years since we adopted the OOV of OOV Rights , but we OOV need to ask OOV whether the human rights situation has in OOV fact OOV .
That is not an OOV question to OOV , but we know more today than we once did , OOV OOV to the many OOV and OOV who OOV report on human rights OOV OOV the world , and OOV is a OOV for action .
But there is , in fact , an OOV to OOV upon information , so that not to do OOV is to OOV down those OOV rights are being OOV , and in this area the EU has an OOV responsibility .
As many OOV have mentioned , the EU has quite a high OOV in the area of human rights , and that is both a good and a OOV OOV .
It is OOV that we are OOV and specific .
In OOV to OOV and OOV European countries , we have had OOV with our policy , which can OOV best be OOV as an OOV OOV in a OOV OOV .
<P> However , that is not enough , for human rights OOV do not , of course , OOV at Europe ' s OOV .
OOV , it is also OOV that we have OOV on human rights in OOV with the new OOV OOV OOV .
However , we must be certain that we are in a position to OOV through and take action if it OOV that human rights are being OOV .
If we have to OOV OOV in OOV and OOV Europe , then OOV will be OOV .
The situation of the OOV countries is quite different in this respect .
If we are OOV to OOV OOV , which more often than not will only OOV the OOV sector of the OOV , we therefore need , where OOV countries are concerned , to OOV a OOV OOV with regard to OOV so that we do not only OOV those we really OOV to help , as well as those who have OOV in the OOV .
<P> This OOV a very OOV OOV for the EU as a whole and also for the European Parliament .
We must be clear which OOV are to be OOV .
However , it is of course OOV for us to work with human rights more OOV so that we can OOV some OOV OOV , for Parliament is OOV to OOV as OOV as we OOV that a human right is being OOV OOV or other .
OOV we go out into the world , we must OOV to be very specific and see what the human rights situation is like in the countries concerned .
We can OOV OOV with human rights OOV and human rights organisations in the area and we can OOV for the OOV report to deal with human rights issues .
I should like , in OOV , to say that those areas OOV with in the resolution are important , but that they are not , of course , the only areas OOV our attention .
That is why I have OOV upon a number of other areas today .
<SPEAKER OOV OOV " NAME=" OOV " > Mr President , I would like to OOV on three issues in this debate on the OOV of the OOV human rights OOV in OOV , and the European Union ' s role in this .
I would like to say a few things about the situation in OOV , and in OOV , and about the OOV OOV OOV .
<P> It is already OOV OOV years since OOV OOV OOV OOV was OOV as President of OOV and the OOV Parliament OOV a OOV of OOV OOV , the OOV
OOV then , OOV has been OOV under a military OOV , OOV of OOV have been OOV or have OOV , and there is OOV of OOV OOV of OOV being OOV against political OOV and OOV .
I have long been a OOV of OOV , a group under the OOV of OOV OOV OOV of OOV , and I have OOV the OOV OOV of the OOV in OOV .
I have a OOV OOV of what is OOV in the country .
I now OOV that there is a OOV of OOV between OOV OOV OOV OOV and the military OOV , and that next OOV , a OOV from the European Union under the OOV of OOV is going to OOV to OOV .
However , OOV of being OOV up the OOV OOV .
The military OOV out there has made OOV OOV before , which OOV OOV to be OOV OOV , and this often OOV just before an OOV OOV , or just before the OOV in OOV .
OOV OOV is OOV OOV a OOV OOV resolution about OOV to hand in OOV and do not have any OOV about OOV for OOV OOV or OOV on that OOV .
I OOV this point not because I am any particular OOV of OOV , but if there is one country that does OOV them , it is OOV .
<P> OOV there is OOV , a country in the OOV of a OOV process and where the government is having to deal with OOV OOV .
The country is OOV OOV problems in a number of regions such as OOV , the OOV , OOV OOV and OOV .
OOV all OOV , more than a million people have now OOV and OOV of OOV have been OOV or OOV .
OOV OOV and OOV OOV OOV are OOV the OOV to OOV for serious OOV of human rights .
The government is not OOV enough about it and so a resolution in OOV would be both OOV and necessary .
The OOV would not be to OOV the OOV government , but to OOV it to deal with the human rights OOV more OOV and OOV the OOV to OOV .
<P> OOV , I would like to OOV attention to the OOV problem , particularly in OOV , of the OOV OOV , who are OOV to OOV the most OOV , OOV OOV .
We see OOV of this in the OOV , and OOV OOV , and the OOV is also on the increase in a number of other countries .
What we are OOV about here is a OOV human rights OOV .
OOV , these OOV are OOV , and then they are OOV , OOV OOV and other OOV , into OOV and OOV people .
OOV when I look at the OOV in OOV , I feel this OOV OOV OOV because it OOV these OOV to its OOV in OOV OOV in order to OOV on a OOV of OOV in OOV .
These OOV also OOV OOV from OOV in OOV OOV for OOV services .
What this in fact means is that these OOV OOV a OOV OOV .
There is an OOV need for a OOV OOV on these OOV in OOV , as I see it , and I also call upon the European Union to OOV a resolution in this OOV .
<P> Mr President , OOV I support the OOV of OOV with regard to OOV , of OOV with regard to OOV , and I OOV the OOV OOV in OOV to the human rights OOV in the conflict between OOV and the OOV , also when it OOV to the OOV public OOV that are OOV out .
I OOV of the OOV OOV at OOV and its OOV of OOV OOV , OOV for women and OOV OOV , but do not OOV OOV and OOV and the OOV OOV .
That was the OOV I particularly OOV to get OOV .
<SPEAKER OOV LANGUAGE="DE " NAME=" OOV , OOV " > Mr President , last year , only a few OOV OOV the OOV of the OOV OOV OOV in OOV on the OOV in OOV .
I hope we can be more OOV in the OOV OOV in OOV over countries that will be OOV on the Commission on OOV Rights at its OOV OOV .
OOV OOV , in my role as OOV of the OOV OOV of the European Parliament , I OOV a OOV in OOV , where OOV from the EU Member States , the OOV countries and the United States OOV OOV of OOV their OOV countries to OOV the issue of OOV 's OOV OOV of human rights .
These OOV not only OOV the OOV but the OOV and OOV too .
OOV OOV , OOV of OOV and OOV of OOV are OOV .
The OOV cannot OOV their own OOV or OOV their own OOV and certainly cannot OOV in OOV political OOV .
OOV of OOV of them have been OOV to OOV , OOV and OOV .
A OOV OOV is being OOV with a view to OOV OOV OOV into OOV .
We cannot OOV our OOV to this second cultural OOV .
<P> I am not OOV , Commissioner OOV , of the OOV between the European Union and OOV .
OOV am I OOV of the role OOV by OOV as a OOV of the OOV and a future OOV OOV .
OOV are being made to deal more OOV with major OOV OOV .
I OOV that , some OOV , the OOV OOV of OOV OOV OOV will be OOV by new OOV OOV .
But we cannot OOV OOV that OOV OOV OOV .
We cannot be OOV OOV and OOV these OOV of people who are being OOV to OOV and OOV OOV .
<P> OOV rights are not a OOV OOV .
The new OOV between the European Union and third countries OOV OOV that OOV OOV will be OOV in the OOV of OOV OOV 's OOV to respect human rights .
We therefore OOV to the Council and Member States of the EU to take the initiative in OOV this time ; as you said , Mr OOV , we are one of the OOV OOV .
OOV with the United States , OOV and , as I have OOV , OOV and the OOV countries for OOV to the EU , we should OOV to OOV the countries of OOV , OOV and OOV OOV that it is high time the subject of OOV was put on the OOV in OOV .
OOV rights are not of OOV importance .
OOV rights are OOV OOV rights .
<SPEAKER OOV LANGUAGE="SV" NAME=" OOV " > Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I should first of all like to say thank you for the OOV support which I OOV that this OOV and its OOV Members have given to positive action by the European Union in the course of the Commission ' s OOV meeting in OOV .
I would also thank you for the many OOV points of view which have been OOV in the debate .
OOV me to OOV on a few of them .
<P> OOV of all , OOV and , more OOV , OOV .
OOV OOV is right .
It was OOV and not OOV that I mentioned .
I just want to OOV that it is the Council ' s view that the situation in OOV is still serious .
It cannot OOV be said to be as OOV as it has been in OOV years , but it is our OOV that we OOV to OOV up the resolution OOV and adopted last year because of the serious situation in OOV .
We have not therefore in any way OOV this important issue .
<P> A number of OOV OOV the situation in OOV .
I want OOV to OOV OOV to the OOV that the European Union is OOV to OOV OOV other countries when it OOV to OOV OOV of human rights in OOV .
At the same time , it is important that , when we do something about the human rights situation in OOV , we can in OOV fact OOV together a OOV OOV group of countries in the OOV OOV Rights Commission in order to achieve some progress .
There are problems here , to which many of the Members OOV in their OOV .
<P> OOV now , we are OOV in a OOV with OOV .
There will be an opportunity here next OOV to have a OOV with the OOV about how the European Union OOV the situation .
However , we also need to OOV further OOV with the OOV OOV in the United States because the United States is OOV the OOV and has been so where this resolution is concerned .
I can therefore OOV the OOV Members that the European Union is OOV to OOV attention to the situation in OOV .
<P> Mrs OOV OOV the issue of the OOV OOV , which is OOV important .
OOV , the European Union must OOV itself from the OOV OOV OOV it is used - including , of course , in the United States .
<P> I am particularly OOV that Mr OOV OOV OOV and OOV have OOV the human rights situation in OOV and am only OOV that I OOV did not do so in my OOV OOV .
It is , of course , not only a question of concern about human rights .
OOV , we all know that , in many OOV countries , the problems are more OOV .
It is not , therefore , only human rights that are the problem .
That must not , of course , OOV us from OOV attention to the problems that OOV .
I can OOV Mr OOV OOV OOV that the European Union will take OOV account of what has been said in this debate where OOV in particular is concerned .
<P> In OOV , a few words about the situation in OOV .
This year too , the European Union is OOV a proposal OOV the situation in OOV , to be OOV at the meeting of the OOV Rights Commission .
It can only be OOV as one OOV in a general OOV for OOV the human rights situation in OOV .
For example , OOV has for many years been responsible for a resolution in the OOV s OOV OOV about the situation in OOV , and the European Union as a whole is OOV OOV in the OOV in the OOV OOV OOV ( OOV ) when it OOV to the fact that OOV OOV still OOV in OOV .
A OOV of measures have been OOV there , which the European Union OOV OOV .
<P> I would therefore OOV my OOV for all the OOV points of view and OOV to OOV them in the Council ' s OOV OOV OOV to the OOV Rights Commission ' s important meeting in OOV OOV this year .
<SPEAKER OOV NAME=" OOV > Mr President , Mr OOV , ladies and gentlemen , OOV me very OOV say and OOV that the Commission will fully take into account the OOV OOV by the OOV and OOV that in my OOV I did not OOV upon all the OOV that could be taken into OOV .
That is why this debate today is extremely important , as is the OOV debate with the OOV , so that we can OOV as much information as possible and OOV it in the position of the European Union in OOV for the meeting of the Commission on OOV Rights .
<P> A few OOV words on some of the OOV .
OOV of all , OOV Mr OOV OOV , I OOV once again that the Commission is OOV forward to OOV the OOV on human rights with OOV and we hope to see OOV OOV from that OOV at the OOV OOV Council this OOV , as the OOV said .
<P> In our concerns , of course , we did not OOV OOV , or OOV , or OOV , or even some OOV issues which are extremely important , like the OOV of OOV , OOV of all OOV or the OOV of OOV - I think those are OOV concerns as far as OOV human rights is concerned .
<P> I would OOV by OOV that we place great OOV on OOV the position of the European Union for the OOV OOV OOV on OOV 's Rights , and I welcome the OOV of the Swedish Presidency to take this position very OOV in OOV .
OOV me also OOV Mr OOV OOV that I fully OOV his concerns about the OOV of OOV in human OOV .
OOV I OOV you that the Commission has just adopted two proposals for framework decisions , one OOV to OOV OOV in human OOV for OOV OOV and the other to OOV against OOV in human OOV for economic OOV .
These will be two important OOV OOV to OOV the legislation to OOV OOV OOV OOV that OOV OOV in human OOV .
We are in the OOV in OOV OOV and OOV the OOV and the OOV of the OOV Member States the necessary OOV legal OOV to OOV against those OOV to human rights and to OOV in the OOV Member States .
<SPEAKER OOV NAME=" President " > OOV you very much , Commissioner OOV .
<P> I have OOV OOV OOV for OOV , OOV to OOV OOV OOV ) of the OOV of OOV .
<P> The debate is OOV .
<P> The vote will take place OOV , OOV , at OOV OOV .
<P> ( The OOV was OOV at OOV OOV and OOV at OOV OOV , OOV the OOV of the OOV by the OOV of the Council ) OOV OOV OOV of the Swedish Presidency <SPEAKER OOV NAME=" President " > It is my very great OOV to welcome Mr OOV , the Swedish OOV OOV .
Mr OOV of the Council , I would like to say that it is an OOV to welcome you to the OOV for the first time , for the start of the Swedish Presidency , We wish you every OOV .
OOV further OOV , I shall give you the OOV .
<SPEAKER OOV LANGUAGE="SV" NAME=" OOV " > Madam President , President of the Commission , ladies and gentlemen , Europe has OOV OOV OOV in only the last OOV .
The OOV OOV has been OOV by cooperation .
There has been an OOV in OOV development , and our OOV have become OOV in a OOV market .
<P> It is no OOV possible to OOV out the OOV OOV on the other OOV of the OOV OOV as the OOV OOV to democracy and peace .
OOV , OOV , the OOV to democracy is OOV from within the OOV OOV themselves .
This may be OOV from the OOV OOV in OOV OOV , the OOV number of people who vote in OOV , OOV OOV on the part of OOV parties and the OOV of OOV OOV OOV .
<P> OOV of the major OOV we OOV in Europe are OOV which we can OOV OOV by OOV in each OOV OOV .
We are too OOV upon one another for that .
The need for cooperation has OOV been greater .
At the same time , I would OOV to OOV that the OOV for cooperation have OOV been more OOV , OOV .
<P> The Swedish Presidency of the European Union has OOV at an important point in a OOV OOV by major OOV and OOV in Europe .
<P> The European Union is OOV its OOV OOV of enlargement to OOV .
OOV we have agreed upon the economic and OOV framework for this OOV OOV , the real negotiations will start .
<P> The European Union has adopted a programme including new OOV of cooperation with a view to OOV the world ' s most OOV and OOV OOV .
OOV employment is one of our OOV OOV .
In economic and OOV OOV we shall OOV see the important OOV of OOV OOV and OOV .
<P> The issues OOV to people ' s OOV are in OOV OOV OOV .
The European Union is now an OOV of OOV OOV OOV .
The OOV is now OOV that OOV does not put a OOV on development but that , on the OOV , OOV and development are OOV each upon the other .
<P> OOV is now taking over the presidency for the first time .
We must OOV in the interests of the whole of the European Union , ensure OOV and OOV and OOV OOV with Europe 's development .
We also wish to OOV the progress that has already been OOV .
It is an OOV for me , as Swedish OOV OOV , to be able to OOV you about our work programme .
I shall OOV to your OOV and points of view with the OOV interest .
<P> We are going to give priority to three areas of the European Union ' s OOV OOV : enlargement , employment and the environment .
These are three OOV policy areas , each one of which is of OOV importance in OOV how the future is going to OOV out for Europe ' s citizens .
<P> I shall OOV with the issue of enlargement .
No issue is so OOV to the OOV s future and to European development as OOV new Members into the European Union .
It is our opportunity to OOV the basis for peace and OOV , democracy and OOV in Europe .
We are OOV in the OOV OOV of the OOV process which will put a OOV to the OOV of Europe into OOV and OOV .
It is with OOV , OOV and a OOV will that the Swedish Government OOV to OOV to OOV to this work , this OOV development .
<P> OOV the OOV Presidency , the OOV OOV , OOV to OOV the OOV s OOV for OOV OOV in an OOV Union , was OOV to a OOV OOV .
OOV economic framework had already been OOV in OOV in the OOV of OOV .
In OOV , it was made clear that the next OOV OOV would be OOV an OOV to , OOV a OOV for , enlargement .
There is still a OOV of work to be done , but it should be possible to welcome new Member States after the end of OOV .
<P> OOV the first OOV OOV of OOV , the enlargement process will OOV a OOV of OOV negotiations in many areas .
OOV s OOV is to OOV to OOV the way for a political OOV in the negotiations .
The principle of OOV will be one of the OOV of this work .
OOV OOV country must be OOV on its own OOV , and all must be given the opportunity of OOV up .
<P> OOV progress has been made in the OOV countries .
If , a OOV is to be OOV , however , the OOV countries will have to continue OOV to OOV OOV in order to OOV the OOV for OOV , and the Member States will have to be OOV in OOV to take the negotiations forward .
The Commission must OOV the process .
We must together OOV to ensure that enlargement can go OOV with OOV support from the citizens of the European Union .
<P> The Swedish Presidency will take OOV of the OOV to OOV forward more OOV with the best OOV OOV countries .
In OOV OOV in OOV , the European Council will OOV the progress made in the enlargement process and provide necessary OOV for its OOV OOV .
<P> OOV will continue to be given to the OOV s OOV with OOV as an OOV country .
OOV OOV in this area will be the OOV into a OOV agreement with OOV and OOV ' s OOV of its national programme for the OOV of the OOV .
<P> There is still a OOV of work to be done , but it should now be possible to welcome new Member States after the end of OOV .
I hope that OOV countries will be able to take part in the OOV to the European Parliament in OOV .
<P> OOV area to be given priority is employment .
OOV in the EU countries is now OOV , and more and more people are OOV OOV .
We must not , however , be OOV with this .
There are still OOV million people in the EU without work .
<P> OOV is an OOV OOV of economic resources and - what is OOV - of people ' s OOV and OOV .
OOV is more important to the OOV ' s development and OOV than to have a OOV and be OOV .
OOV is more important for democracy and OOV than work for all .
A European Union that does not take OOV OOV can OOV be the citizens ' Europe we all wish to see .
<P> OOV , in the course of debate , the OOV of making the EU into an employment OOV has been OOV as OOV more than a OOV OOV , but something new has OOV in this area .
In OOV in OOV of last year , the European Council set a new OOV OOV for the European Union .
OOV OOV OOV , the EU is to become the most OOV and OOV OOV OOV in the world .
At the same time , it was made clear that full employment was to OOV a OOV OOV of the Union ' s economic and social policy .
I view this as great progress and these OOV as OOV important OOV in the development of the European Union .
<P> OOV ' s Europe is better OOV than it has been for a very long time to OOV the opportunity of work to OOV - those who want to work and are able to .
The OOV for the European OOV OOV good .
OOV OOV are OOV .
OOV are OOV .
OOV of the OOV and OOV OOV have been OOV OOV Europe .
<P> The OOV to full employment is OOV OOV economic OOV , OOV social security and OOV OOV .
It is also OOV OOV in education and OOV , new OOV and OOV , as well as OOV in the environment and OOV between OOV and women .
<P> The European Council in OOV on OOV to OOV OOV will be the first in a OOV of OOV OOV OOV to OOV development towards the OOV set in OOV .
In OOV , we OOV , in an open and OOV way , to OOV the progress made .
The work will be OOV forward by Community law , where OOV , but OOV by the new open OOV of OOV .
As the country OOV the presidency , we shall OOV not to OOV the OOV OOV by OOV too many new issues .
OOV do we need any new OOV .
OOV , the OOV OOV OOV to OOV certain priority areas .
<P> We are in the OOV of a OOV of extremely OOV development in which OOV is OOV more and more by OOV OOV and less and less by OOV OOV .
At the same time , OOV is OOV .
The most important OOV OOV will be human OOV in the case of OOV and education in the case of OOV .
OOV and OOV OOV , education , OOV and other OOV services will be the OOV resources at national and local level .
<P> The Swedish OOV OOV has always been OOV on the OOV that OOV and OOV are OOV in themselves and that development is that much OOV if OOV is given the opportunity to OOV to it and OOV OOV in its OOV .
OOV , development OOV that OOV which have high OOV of employment and well OOV OOV , which have OOV in OOV OOV development , which have a OOV OOV of OOV and OOV OOV systems are also those countries which have OOV OOV in the new OOV OOV .
OOV which do not make the most of the OOV and OOV of all their citizens will OOV out in terms of OOV .
<P> OOV this must be OOV Europe ' s OOV OOV development .
OOV OOV OOV OOV , OOV OOV OOV and the OOV number of OOV people OOV OOV to increase the number of people to be OOV by people of working OOV .
OOV OOV must be OOV on a OOV political OOV .
OOV OOV of OOV systems and of systems of health OOV and OOV of the OOV will be OOV .
OOV will be OOV to increase OOV in the OOV market .
The importance of OOV conditions for OOV with OOV , of greater OOV and of OOV OOV OOV to be clearly OOV .
<P> As more people OOV work , more and more attention will be OOV on working conditions .
The OOV is to be able to agree upon a OOV of the OOV of quality at work and its importance for OOV and employment .
<P> We OOV also , in OOV , to OOV the importance of new OOV by further OOV the action plan for OOV and OOV more attention to the importance of OOV for OOV and OOV .
<P> I also want to OOV how OOV important it is for OOV and OOV in Europe for economic and OOV OOV to be OOV OOV .
As the country OOV the presidency , OOV will OOV work to ensure the OOV OOV of the OOV of OOV OOV and OOV which is to take place in the OOV OOV at the OOV of OOV and which is in our common interest .
<P> The third important area is the environment .
The major OOV to the environment cannot be OOV without OOV international cooperation .
There must be OOV EU cooperation in the area of the environment .
We must OOV on the basis of a OOV view of policy .
The OOV OOV is often OOV as OOV , and the OOV of the OOV society as a OOV in conflict with OOV such as OOV and OOV OOV OOV .
That is a OOV .
It is OOV the other way OOV .
<P> OOV OOV in terms of OOV and by OOV new OOV OOV and new OOV that OOV on resources , it is now fully possible to use the OOV ' s resources without OOV them .
At the same time , these OOV OOV OOV OOV for economic OOV in new OOV .
There is OOV OOV here and OOV I want to see us make full use of .
I want the EU to take the OOV and point the way to development in which OOV , economic and social OOV OOV to OOV one another .
<P> OOV OOV must be OOV into all areas of EU cooperation .
The OOV s OOV environmental action programme must be OOV forward .
It must OOV for the next OOV years and must be OOV towards clear and OOV OOV environmental OOV and environmental OOV .
The programme should be one of the OOV for the OOV OOV for OOV OOV OOV to be adopted at the European Council OOV in OOV .
This OOV should be OOV upon a number of OOV areas in which we at present OOV development as being OOV , as well as upon measures which can OOV the OOV .
The Commission will OOV present a proposal for such a OOV .
<P> OOV must also be given to the OOV OOV OOV market .
OOV will work to achieve a OOV new OOV on OOV in which the OOV principle is an important point of OOV .
<P> OOV but OOV not least , the OOV issue as it OOV to OOV , OOV and OOV OOV .
OOV OOV are as OOV as the OOV that environmental OOV is on the way to OOV OOV and OOV OOV OOV .
The OOV issue is OOV to the OOV s OOV , and we shall continue to give it priority .
The OOV negotiations must be OOV .
<P> OOV issues have a OOV OOV OOV .
The OOV is on OOV to us from our OOV and OOV .
OOV OOV ' s OOV is to OOV OOV us a Europe in which the major environmental problems have been OOV .
<P> There are a number of points on which the new Treaty from OOV OOV OOV and more OOV cooperation .
OOV cooperation between OOV small OOV of Member States is made OOV .
OOV more decisions must be made by OOV OOV OOV and by means of a OOV OOV with the European Parliament .
The issue of the position of the OOV OOV countries in an OOV EU has been OOV .
I OOV it to be possible for the new Treaty to be OOV within just over a OOV .
For their part , the Member States have already OOV themselves to working for a OOV and OOV OOV of the new Treaty .
<P> The European Union is not OOV .
OOV has its own OOV .
The Union is OOV OOV with new OOV from the world OOV and from its own citizens .
We also have good reason for OOV the way in which the European Union as a whole is OOV .
<P> In OOV with the OOV OOV which has now come to an end , a number of issues for the future were OOV in the debate .
That is why the OOV OOV in OOV about the OOV s future was appropriate .
This OOV a further OOV OOV in OOV and OOV upon the Swedish and the OOV OOV OOV to open a debate on issues for the future with all OOV parties in OOV .
This must take place in cooperation with the Commission and with the OOV of the European Parliament .
OOV the issues to be OOV during the process OOV up to the next OOV OOV , OOV are OOV : first of all , how a more OOV OOV of OOV between the Member States and the European Union is to be OOV and OOV ; OOV , the OOV of the OOV OOV of OOV Rights ; OOV , how the OOV might be OOV without their OOV being OOV ; and OOV , the role of the national OOV .
<P> The Swedish Presidency OOV OOV a OOV and more OOV debate in both the Member States and the OOV countries as an OOV and OOV OOV .
We OOV the European Parliament to take an OOV part and to use its OOV role in order to take OOV of its own to OOV the debate .
I hope that national OOV and OOV will also want to take OOV OOV .
We OOV also to make OOV efforts to OOV our young people , and we need to form a OOV OOV of people ' s view of future cooperation in the OOV
<P> What we now call the EU was once OOV in order to make OOV OOV on the European OOV , and it has been OOV OOV in that respect .
OOV OOV OOV OOV in Europe and its OOV .
In the OOV future , the OOV for Europe in terms of security policy will be about OOV OOV and OOV OOV .
This OOV a OOV of civil and military OOV management OOV .
OOV cooperation must also be OOV between the OOV and the OOV
<P> The Swedish Presidency will give high priority to OOV the decisions made by the European Council in OOV OOV the European Union ' s OOV for military and civil OOV management .
The OOV is that the European Union must take a decision to become OOV in military and civil terms as OOV as possible during OOV .
<P> In the military OOV , it is OOV a question of OOV OOV OOV , as well as of further OOV the work being done on the cooperation OOV between the EU and OOV .
<P> In the civil area , we shall OOV on with the work on OOV the OOV to plan and OOV civil OOV , OOV in OOV with the OOV .
A OOV OOV on the OOV in terms of OOV OOV to OOV will take place during the Swedish Presidency .
OOV OOV will also be OOV in order to OOV the OOV system , civil OOV and civil OOV .
<P> In OOV with the work on OOV the OOV s OOV management OOV , OOV will make OOV efforts to work out a OOV and OOV EU policy for conflict OOV .
We OOV to OOV a European programme for conflict OOV to be OOV to the European Council in OOV .
<P> I know that the European Parliament has a OOV interest in both OOV management and conflict OOV .
You have OOV OOV proposals , and important OOV have been OOV in Parliament .
I look forward to OOV OOV cooperation .
<P> OOV in OOV are important to the future of Europe as a whole .
Europe and OOV need each other .
OOV priority OOV therefore to be given to OOV cooperation between the EU and OOV .
At the same time , our relations must be OOV by OOV and OOV , including a OOV to OOV OOV when OOV .
This OOV , for example , in the case of OOV in OOV , which continue to give OOV for OOV concern , and also to the situation OOV the OOV of OOV opinion in OOV .
The OOV from the EU should be that a OOV OOV must be OOV upon the basis of common OOV .
In a OOV democracy , a OOV State must be OOV by a OOV civil society .
<P> The presidency ' s OOV is to OOV a policy OOV OOV OOV at both cooperation and OOV , with a view to OOV greater OOV and OOV in our relations .
OOV , we want to see OOV OOV between the EU and OOV on political , economic and legal issues .
We want to OOV cooperation in order to OOV OOV , OOV OOV and OOV OOV and OOV .
We want to OOV OOV ' s OOV into the world OOV , OOV by OOV the country in its OOV to become a OOV of the OOV .
We want to see more in the way of cooperation in order to OOV the common OOV we OOV on our OOV , including the OOV to the environment and from international OOV OOV .
We want to see OOV support for OOV in OOV , especially with a view to OOV civil society and OOV the OOV .
<P> OOV attention will also be given to the OOV in the OOV OOV , in the OOV OOV and on the OOV OOV .
In the case of the OOV OOV , it is really a question of OOV OOV , but also of economic OOV and financial OOV .
The region ' s OOV OOV with the EU by means of OOV and OOV OOV is of OOV importance .
If such a OOV is to become a OOV , clear efforts at cooperation between the countries in the region is , however , OOV .
<P> In the conflict in the OOV OOV , the European Union has OOV an important role in OOV the OOV peace efforts .
OOV its presidency , OOV will work for a OOV OOV European role in the peace process .
<P> In a few OOV ' time , a new OOV President will be OOV in .
There are good OOV for OOV new OOV to cooperation with the United States .
OOV issues and the implementation of the action plan within the OOV OOV OOV are OOV OOV of our OOV .
OOV OOV about trade policy must be OOV through OOV OOV OOV but they must not OOV the many common political interests and the OOV OOV we have with the United States .
<P> In a Union which OOV the OOV first , political debate must be OOV OOV and OOV must be OOV .
It must also be possible to OOV OOV of the OOV process and to OOV those who take the decisions OOV .
This will OOV OOV work to make the EU a more open and more OOV Union .
<P> The Treaty of OOV OOV a legal basis for rules OOV public OOV to the OOV ' OOV .
OOV OOV a great deal of importance to the work being done on the legal OOV OOV OOV , which is to be adopted under this OOV of the Treaty .
The Commission , which - as part of its OOV OOV - has taken a number of OOV of its own towards OOV OOV , has OOV a proposal on the matter .
OOV the Council is at work on the OOV OOV OOV , OOV OOV OOV OOV OOV with the European Parliament , which has OOV great OOV to the issue of OOV .
We OOV to OOV this issue with a view to OOV a OOV OOV by the OOV .
<P> As I mentioned in the OOV to my OOV , the European Union ' s OOV OOV have been given a more OOV place in the Union ' s OOV .
The OOV work on the OOV of OOV Rights is an important OOV of this .
OOV with this , the subject of human rights should be taken up more OOV in the political OOV with other countries OOV to OOV peace , as well as in OOV with countries OOV the OOV
The European Union must also take an OOV part in the OOV OOV Rights Commission and in the OOV to the OOV world OOV in this area .
<P> It is important that , through their OOV OOV OOV , Europe ' s citizens should have OOV upon , and OOV into , European cooperation .
The European Parliament has a OOV role in this respect .
<P> The Swedish Presidency is OOV to see good , OOV cooperation with Parliament during the next OOV OOV .
We shall OOV OOV in the important European political OOV taking place in this OOV , in this Parliament .
<P> OOV decisions OOV before us .
The future of Europe will be OOV through cooperation .
OOV us work together for a Europe of peace , OOV , OOV and social OOV .
<P> <SPEAKER OOV NAME=" President " > OOV you , Mr OOV of the Council , for your OOV .
<P> I shall now give the OOV to Mr OOV , the President of the Commission .
<SPEAKER OOV OOV " NAME=" OOV > Madam President , OOV OOV , ladies and gentlemen , it OOV me great OOV to OOV before you today at the start of a new presidency and to wish you all a OOV OOV OOV .
In OOV your OOV presidency , Mr OOV , I can only OOV my OOV at OOV 's OOV of a very OOV OOV OOV on the OOV OOV <P> The OOV OOV is first of all for " OOV , our OOV OOV , in which OOV will be OOV its best efforts over the next OOV OOV to achieve progress in the OOV of OOV , OOV and the OOV .
<P> But OOV is also for the OOV .
The year OOV will be the OOV OOV before the OOV OOV and OOV come into OOV and it will also be the last year of the OOV of many national OOV .
OOV of them are well over a OOV years OOV and , both OOV and as OOV , we have become OOV to them .
The Swedish Presidency will therefore be OOV us some of the way towards the OOV OOV of OOV OOV OOV .
<P> I would like to OOV for a OOV on the three OOV which are the OOV of the Swedish Presidency 's programme which OOV OOV OOV has just set out .
These three OOV are well OOV , for they are all areas in which the Union and Europe as a whole OOV OOV OOV and OOV .
They are not only the OOV for these OOV OOV , to be OOV OOV : they are OOV OOV which are the OOV of the OOV OOV OOV .
<P> OOV for enlargement : OOV , it is OOV OOV , is the OOV OOV OOV the European Union .
We are at a OOV in the OOV of Europe : we have the opportunity to OOV an area of peace , OOV and OOV for OOV million citizens who OOV the same OOV .
OOV make enlargement possible , we OOV to OOV out a number of OOV OOV .
OOV the Treaty of OOV is not OOV OOV , or rather not at all OOV , it is still a OOV in the right OOV and will OOV us to continue OOV the OOV we have already OOV on .
For this reason , and also because OOV , aware of its OOV , OOV for a OOV , I would OOV this House , when the time OOV , to OOV to its national OOV that they OOV the Treaty of OOV .
OOV , it is clear to me that peace , OOV and OOV cannot OOV at the OOV of the European Union but must also OOV as far as possible all our OOV and OOV .
I am therefore OOV to see that relations with OOV are also OOV the OOV presidency 's OOV .
<P> OOV own recent OOV to OOV OOV was part of this same OOV of OOV a OOV OOV policy .
OOV OOV our OOV , we must , in fact , be OOV not to OOV this OOV .
The OOV OOV is also OOV for our interests and we are OOV at various OOV of OOV and OOV it .
OOV shall we - or , of course , the presidency - OOV the OOV OOV of the Union , which is of OOV importance .
<P> The second OOV is for employment .
This priority is very much in OOV with the new economic and social OOV for Europe which we agreed upon at OOV .
I fully support your OOV to OOV that OOV .
In particular , the Commission OOV the presidency 's OOV on OOV the OOV market and on the need to OOV OOV OOV for OOV and women in our society .
OOV our OOV means more OOV , and the OOV of OOV OOV is a OOV OOV of the OOV against OOV .
The Commission OOV to work OOV with the presidency to help ensure the OOV of the OOV OOV , which will be OOV OOV to these OOV .
In this OOV , the Commission OOV to OOV a new OOV for OOV a European OOV market by OOV , the OOV of which will be OOV in the OOV OOV OOV being OOV for the OOV meeting .
<P> The third OOV is for OOV .
OOV citizens are concerned about environmental and OOV OOV issues , including OOV safety which is OOV particularly important .
The recent OOV OOV the OOV OOV provide the OOV possible OOV and the Commission has already set about taking measures to deal OOV with this OOV .
We have a responsibility towards future OOV to OOV the OOV development of our OOV and make our OOV OOV with the OOV OOV of the OOV .
I am OOV forward to working together with the Swedish Presidency in order to ensure an OOV , OOV European Union OOV for OOV development .
The OOV OOV must take OOV , OOV OOV - and I OOV , OOV and OOV - on this OOV issue .
<P> In this OOV , the Union must OOV OOV to OOV OOV on the issues OOV to OOV change .
We must OOV our OOV OOV and OOV OOV OOV on our international OOV to OOV OOV .
In this regard , OOV is also for a more OOV use of OOV , and OOV OOV is OOV on all OOV of the OOV , use , OOV and environmental OOV of energy OOV .
I therefore welcome the OOV OOV by the presidency on these OOV .
<P> I have OOV many OOV before this OOV for development of European policy on OOV , and I welcome OOV OOV OOV 's OOV on this and the fact that a OOV part of his OOV was OOV to the matter .
The OOV of the citizens in both the major decisions and the OOV life of Europe and its OOV is , in fact , one of the Commission 's OOV .
I would therefore like to OOV the presidency of our full support for their OOV to OOV OOV and OOV .
<P> Madam President , OOV OOV , ladies and gentlemen , the OOV OOV for the next OOV OOV are OOV and will , I am OOV , make a OOV OOV on our citizens .
However , I do not see the OOV OOV as OOV OOV OOV in OOV from each other , but rather as part of a OOV process which will have a OOV OOV .
<P> I therefore fully OOV the efforts made by the Swedish OOV OOV to OOV us that he will be OOV on the OOV OOV OOV by the OOV work of the OOV presidency so that the next presidency can continue its work OOV .
This is all the more OOV if we consider the OOV issue of what has come to be OOV OOV , or the specific debate on the future of the Union .
OOV I last OOV before this House , I made clear my OOV not only at certain OOV of the Treaty which had just been agreed but , in particular , at the OOV which had OOV OOV the OOV .
At OOV , OOV Member States , each - OOV - OOV on its own national interests , were able to OOV only an OOV agreement .
<P> <P> What is more - and this is the most important point - the OOV of the OOV of State and Government were more concerned with OOV the OOV to OOV the future action of the Union rather than OOV a way of OOV the common OOV .
<P> ( OOV ) OOV was OOV a clear OOV of what is OOV by agreement on the OOV common OOV .
It would be OOV to OOV that we can continue in this way .
I OOV back from OOV with OOV of a OOV which I OOV already and which I had already OOV here : it is OOV said that the ' OOV OOV ' has OOV its OOV but I believe , on the OOV , that it is not the ' OOV OOV ' but the OOV OOV which is OOV OOV of OOV .
<P> ( OOV We must therefore OOV from this OOV and OOV our OOV to the debate on the future of the Union , which will take us up to OOV , although it is still too OOV to have a clear OOV of what will be involved .
<P> The first OOV is that OOV positive or OOV can be done to OOV the future of Europe without the OOV OOV of the whole of Europe , including , of course , all the OOV countries .
<P> I see the OOV up to OOV as OOV into three quite OOV OOV : the first OOV , which has already OOV , is one of what I would call OOV OOV ' .
That is what we are OOV today .
OOV this OOV there must be the OOV possible debate at all OOV of civil society , OOV and OOV on the future of Europe .
OOV of us must OOV to OOV this OOV and OOV OOV OOV .
We must give some real OOV to our OOV of OOV by OOV a OOV and OOV system which will OOV an OOV Union to OOV OOV , OOV and OOV .
<P> The contribution of the European OOV political parties is OOV in order to OOV this debate in civil society .
I would , in particular , like to OOV a meeting , to take place in the OOV future , with the OOV of the political OOV in this Parliament to OOV the matter .
OOV OOV is to use this OOV of OOV to OOV OOV OOV on the OOV to be OOV and the means to be OOV to achieve them .
This debate must be open , with no OOV OOV .
OOV , the OOV way of going about it would be to OOV OOV on the OOV OOV mentioned in the OOV OOV .
This is now OOV ' .
These OOV - the OOV of OOV Rights , OOV of the Treaty , OOV of OOV and the OOV of a second OOV - are , of course , very important .
A OOV OOV of work has been done on some of them , such as , for example , the OOV of the Treaty , but these OOV are no more than OOV of a OOV OOV , which must be both more OOV and more OOV OOV <P> ( OOV ) <P> and is best OOV by the OOV of the OOV of the OOV of State and Government , when they OOV the question : " What do we want for the future of the Union ? "
I hope that this House , through the European political parties OOV here , will OOV its full role not only as the OOV of the OOV democracy of the Community OOV process , but also as the OOV OOV up with national political parties and the public they OOV .
<P> ( OOV I would OOV OOV you to take on this OOV , in which you can OOV on my support .
It is necessary for the future of Europe .
The Commission , for its part , OOV to start a OOV , open OOV with European society and with the OOV OOV in the political systems of the Union .
This is OOV one .
<P> The second OOV will have to OOV OOV after the OOV OOV in OOV this year .
This OOV , which we could OOV OOV OOV ' , is OOV to be the OOV and would have to OOV OOV an OOV OOV of OOV OOV OOV in the OOV OOV .
It cannot be OOV to OOV OOV negotiations OOV OOV OOV .
In OOV , we will have to OOV a new OOV which OOV the need for both OOV and OOV .
<P> The third OOV - which is OOV - has to be that of another OOV OOV OOV .
I can see no reason for it to be OOV , but it could be OOV and result in OOV decisions .
OOV three are important : OOV , OOV and the taking of decisions .
<P> As I have said , the OOV we are about to OOV on will have to be open , for , as has been OOV in the last few OOV , what it OOV down to is OOV about the OOV of political life in a Union with OOV or more OOV .
<P> However , I would be OOV my OOV and OOV in my OOV if I did not OOV , yet again , the concerns which I OOV here on OOV OOV last year , for they have OOV OOV of their OOV .
OOV , I OOV believe that the Community OOV , its OOV , its OOV and its OOV are the Union 's future , not its OOV .
In fact , the OOV of the Union over the OOV OOV years and , more especially , since OOV , has OOV a OOV political system which cannot be OOV to any national OOV .
The Union is , in fact , OOV .
It is OOV on a OOV OOV : that OOV by the OOV of Europe which you , ladies and gentlemen , OOV , and that of the Member States OOV in the Council , which is in OOV OOV on the OOV national vote .
The Union 's OOV is therefore OOV : it cannot be said that there is no OOV .
It is OOV - as well OOV - because it is OOV OOV an OOV , the Commission , which is an OOV OOV OOV but OOV of the interests of all the Member States , both OOV and small , and the OOV of OOV between them .
The Commission is the necessary OOV for the OOV of OOV in the Community , which will make it possible to OOV the great OOV of the future such as enlargement .
OOV , the Union can be OOV under OOV , as the Court of OOV is there to see that OOV OOV by common rules .
<P> In this OOV , the debate on what must or must not be done at European or national level by way of OOV government action is most welcome and is a result of this debate .
The OOV and OOV of the Union and of its Member States should OOV all the OOV .
OOV OOV of the Community OOV process , in particular of OOV action , must be OOV as being OOV to the OOV for which we are OOV .
This is especially OOV as , OOV OOV OOV about the OOV OOV of OOV , we now have the extremely important - I OOV , extremely important - OOV of OOV cooperation , made possible by the Treaty of OOV within the framework of the Community OOV .
OOV OOV action , OOV in the OOV of the principle of OOV and of a OOV OOV of the OOV of Europe , OOV OOV the OOV OOV OOV to the Community OOV , can OOV this result .
<P> Madam President , OOV OOV , ladies and gentlemen , we are OOV upon a OOV OOV in OOV and action .
The OOV are OOV but so too is our OOV .
The Commission will work hand in hand with each of the OOV OOV to OOV this major OOV to a OOV OOV .
I will be OOV on all of you , European OOV and Members of this Parliament , and on your OOV to work OOV us .
<P> ( OOV , OOV OOV ) <SPEAKER OOV LANGUAGE="DE " NAME=" OOV " > .
( OOV ) Madam President , Mr President of the Council , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , President of the Council , you have OOV to OOV OOV with the European Parliament and the OOV .
We are OOV to take that on OOV , for we do indeed have good OOV .
I can OOV you on behalf of our group that you also have our full support in OOV to the OOV of your OOV , in which you give priority to a European Community approach , rather than to OOV cooperation , the cooperation between OOV that we OOV OOV in the Community framework .
We must not OOV into OOV cooperation .
<P> <P> You have a very OOV country as your OOV - just as we find OOV OOV .
We OOV OOV more about a European Community approach in OOV , and I would like to see OOV and OOV of one OOV on these issues .
You are following in the OOV of OOV OOV and that means you are taking over a OOV , OOV the OOV of the Treaty of OOV .
I cannot agree with the view you set out here , that the Treaty of OOV is a OOV .
But a OOV is also an opportunity , because it can be OOV OOV .
We would like to OOV OOV with you in the OOV OOV and OOV in OOV OOV the OOV of OOV .
That is why our Group of the European OOV 's OOV and European OOV will at this point say OOV OOV OOV OOV to the Treaty of OOV .
<P> I have just OOV on the European OOV 's OOV 's resolution from the OOV OOV to the presidency of the Council , OOV by Mr OOV .
Mr OOV OOV , our Commission President , OOV to the need to work OOV together , not just in the Community framework of our European parties , but also with the national parties .
This OOV OOV OOV the OOV I want to put to you with no OOV against , with all OOV national parties OOV in favour .
OOV , on the OOV OOV system : a OOV that OOV on for OOV and OOV must become a OOV of the OOV ; it is not a OOV for the future .
We are OOV against OOV to the OOV system .
<P> ( OOV ) OOV , given that the OOV have to OOV under your presidency and should then OOV to a decision in OOV under the OOV Presidency , we call on you to OOV a OOV OOV OOV , OOV on the OOV and OOV of the OOV , with greater OOV by the European Parliament and the national OOV , and OOV all , of course , of the Commission too .
We call on you to start the debate OOV and we also call on you , Mr President of the Council , to OOV the OOV that have OOV in the Treaty of OOV even before the Treaty is OOV .
<P> We have OOV that OOV was to be given OOV OOV in the Council of OOV than OOV .
That was OOV , because OOV it was just a OOV OOV .
There are other OOV OOV : the OOV OOV and OOV , which have the same OOV OOV as OOV and OOV , are only to have OOV OOV , OOV the other two countries have OOV .
OOV us also give the OOV OOV and OOV OOV Members in the European Parliament and OOV us not OOV enlargement by OOV against these two countries .
You can OOV that before the Treaty is OOV , for if it is OOV a OOV OOV , OOV it does not need any political decisions .
<P> I OOV now to the question of OOV .
We OOV with great concern that through its OOV the Council 's OOV OOV has OOV a number of OOV at OOV level , with the OOV to OOV on information OOV to the Commission or to the European Parliament OOV Mr OOV , for OOV I have a high regard , is of course more OOV with his OOV as OOV OOV .
OOV see to it that we have OOV ; that is the great hope we place in your presidency .
<P> ( OOV President , since I OOV OOV OOV you say in your OOV of OOV Swedish OOV OOV and President of the Council , I OOV your OOV to the OOV OOV on OOV OOV , in which you said you place high OOV in the Council of OOV .
I hope OOV OOV you OOV .
The Council of OOV does not need to be OOV , it needs to become more OOV and to be OOV , so that the OOV of the Council are also OOV open to the public .
<P> OOV third and last point is enlargement .
OOV we are of the same OOV : we regard enlargement as a OOV , OOV and political OOV and one that must not be OOV , OOV the decision we take on OOV .
<P> OOV me OOV by OOV that Europe must become more OOV .
You had many OOV things to say about the OOV .
I agree , but you must have the OOV to OOV the OOV in Europe by OOV the people of your country that the OOV is a OOV and that OOV is OOV us OOV this road .
<P> ( OOV I wish you OOV , and your OOV will be our common OOV .
You are not a OOV of our OOV , OOV I wish you OOV because what is at OOV is the OOV OOV of all , OOV Europe , so OOV us work together .
<P> ( OOV ) <SPEAKER OOV LANGUAGE="ES " NAME=" OOV OOV > Madam President , Mr OOV of the Council , Mr President of the Commission , ladies and gentlemen , first of all I would like to welcome the OOV of the Council , OOV OOV OOV .
This is the first time that OOV has OOV the presidency of the Council and it has OOV its OOV , the OOV OOV OOV , which are in OOV with the OOV of the European OOV and OOV OOV , because I am able to say with OOV that Mr OOV and his OOV OOV to my own political OOV , and the OOV which the Swedish OOV OOV has made here in favour of the European social OOV and its OOV to OOV in this OOV of OOV is a further OOV of OOV .
<P> <P> On employment , I would like to OOV OOV that he can OOV on our support at the OOV OOV for OOV on employment , OOV and the OOV upon which he OOV his OOV , social OOV .
On enlargement , I hope that OOV s OOV for enlargement will help the European Union to find greater favour with the Swedish people .
On the environment , we support OOV s initiative to put OOV development into OOV .
<P> Madam President , the OOV of the Council has OOV to an issue we consider OOV and that is the OOV of Europe OOV by public opinion in Europe .
The OOV of European public opinion , OOV in recent OOV in various OOV , OOV the OOV we OOV .
The people of Europe , even the OOV , are OOV for more European OOV to problems , yet at the same time they still have very OOV OOV in European OOV .
This is an issue which OOV us in the Commission and Parliament , but also the national OOV .
We see OOV of this in the OOV OOV problem .
The Commission , by which I OOV the OOV Commission , OOV its role , as did the OOV Commission .
Parliament set up a committee of OOV in OOV and , this OOV , we have OOV once again , in the case of OOV and OOV , how OOV OOV OOV the problem when they have no other OOV .
They are still OOV their OOV in the OOV , when what we need are European OOV to European problems .
<P> The next issue which is going to OOV the Swedish Presidency OOV , and indeed which is going to OOV us all OOV , from the year OOV , which is just OOV , OOV the year OOV - a OOV OOV in which many OOV are to take place , including European OOV , is the OOV ' OOV .
I would like to OOV to the Swedish Presidency .
You are OOV no OOV OOV at OOV the OOV OOV of the Community .
You do , however , have OOV OOV in the areas of democracy and OOV , and that is what we need at this OOV in time .
You therefore have a OOV responsibility .
OOV , I welcome the OOV you OOV to OOV at a clear agreement on such a OOV issue as OOV to OOV , but we have to go further than that .
You OOV through the OOV OOV of the European Council in OOV , and you will have been as OOV by it as your OOV .
I agree with President OOV that it is not the OOV OOV which is in question here , but the OOV OOV because , and I would like to point this out to OOV , and this is an OOV OOV , our OOV are still in the process of OOV negotiations .
You said that the Treaty would be OOV within a OOV .
We shall have to OOV and see what OOV are OOV into the Treaty .
This is not OOV .
We must see an end to this OOV .
<P> ( OOV ) <P> OOV , OOV from what you said at the end , there is a positive OOV in OOV OOV in that it does not OOV to another OOV OOV .
You OOV a OOV of Member States .
OOV , you have said OOV that Parliament has a OOV role in taking the initiative , and as we are being OOV here , I am going to OOV President OOV s proposal , a Commission initiative which I welcome .
We have OOV years to get to work .
OOV OOV a OOV OOV , with the first OOV OOV of open OOV .
I would OOV the Council to become involved in this first OOV , which you have to OOV and end at OOV , during which we have to OOV the OOV we can use to make progress , and consider not just the future of the Union but the future of the OOV Union because , OOV , those countries are already on OOV and they must OOV how we OOV , which is no OOV OOV .
OOV , Mr OOV of the Council , I would also ask you to put forward OOV for the OOV OOV at the end of the year .
<P> OOV , what OOV should we OOV ?
For me and my group the OOV should be the OOV OOV OOV in all our countries : open debate in Parliament , OOV in full .
These OOV it is available on the OOV .
That is a way of OOV and OOV the OOV OOV , OOV more .
OOV , OOV , the debate should be OOV through all OOV of the OOV , but civil society should not be OOV in OOV to OOV , because we OOV in OOV OOV and we have to work out a OOV system .
<P> OOV , Madam President , and this is my OOV point , I believe that the OOV of Member States must be the last OOV , when decisions on OOV OOV are made , and it should not be a OOV and OOV process .
<P> That OOV me , Madam President , to what really is my OOV point , to say that you could have OOV another OOV to the European process , and I say this as a OOV , and that would be the OOV OOV for OOV ' - OOV .
<P> ( OOV ) <SPEAKER OOV LANGUAGE="SV" NAME=" OOV " > Madam President , Commission , I would like to welcome the OOV OOV here .
The next OOV OOV will be an OOV OOV .
OOV political OOV OOV us , and a OOV presidency may OOV also have a positive OOV on public opinion .
It can OOV our OOV OOV at OOV that good things can be OOV together in the OOV
It can OOV our European OOV here that OOV is not in OOV to the European OOV but , rather , OOV to take a OOV part in it .
<P> The Group of the European OOV , OOV and OOV OOV fully OOV OOV s decision to make enlargement a priority .
There is no OOV more important than OOV a OOV Europe , and the negotiations really need to take a major OOV forward this OOV .
We would also like to have a OOV for when the first countries will be able to OOV us .
<P> OOV issue - in which the OOV OOV has the support of both the OOV and of OOV OOV of Parliament - concerns OOV .
OOV OOV to OOV is an important OOV issue , which is OOV to citizens ' OOV in the OOV EU OOV .
OOV the OOV , the Council has been OOV OOV on this issue - the work on OOV OOV - and it is time that we OOV some results .
We have great OOV of OOV and of OOV s role in OOV and OOV OOV the OOV OOV , for OOV , in OOV and the OOV .
As a case in point , why not OOV by OOV up the OOV of the Council of OOV ?
<P> The issue of democracy is also OOV OOV to the OOV which are now to take place OOV .
The OOV must be OOV .
The OOV s OOV and OOV must be more clearly OOV .
We OOV also believe that OOV need a common European OOV .
OOV must be involved in the work which will OOV on from the OOV of the OOV OOV .
It is up to OOV to OOV the OOV which President OOV OOV OOV OOV ' .
It would be OOV to be OOV in rather more OOV terms how the OOV OOV OOV this OOV , the OOV and these issues , which OOV further work before the OOV Presidency OOV .
<P> <SPEAKER OOV LANGUAGE="SV" NAME=" OOV > Madam President , President of the Commission , OOV of the Council , I have OOV to OOV Swedish today , since it is my country ' s second OOV OOV .
<P> Mr OOV of the Council , I really believe that the OOV at the start of the Swedish Presidency are very high following our OOV with the OOV Presidency .
OOV , I am OOV that OOV will once more OOV the OOV that the OOV Member States are often more OOV , something which will favour the common European interest over OOV national interests .
This is your first presidency , and your OOV - if I may say this in public - has very OOV OOV a first presidency with OOV one ' s OOV .
OOV certainly did not wish to OOV it in a OOV OOV .
I can OOV you that the European Parliament can make a presidency OOV and that you will therefore OOV your OOV in a very OOV and OOV way .
<P> OOV Group OOV to see progress particularly in the following areas .
OOV development must become a OOV now .
It is now or OOV .
The OOV and OOV must be OOV in OOV in OOV with what you have OOV us .
OOV OOV management is something which can be OOV under a Swedish Presidency .
OOV OOV in all areas of OOV policy is very important to our Group .
We welcome your OOV of a programme in this area .
<P> OOV which OOV does not have as clear an OOV on the Swedish OOV is a OOV OOV of the OOV s agricultural policy , OOV on the fact that our OOV must be made OOV again .
The environment must no OOV be OOV and OOV must no OOV be OOV .
I have been following the Swedish debate and OOV that you OOV OOV that you are really a OOV , or at least a OOV OOV .
OOV I welcome you to the OOV .
<P> It may come as a OOV to OOV and to the citizens of OOV , but this is one of a number of areas which OOV more , not less , of a European OOV .
OOV OOV are an OOV example .
OOV OOV that the OOV on OOV needs to be OOV in this area .
As my OOV have also OOV out , what we need here is a Community OOV , that is to say OOV common OOV - OOV the Commission and Parliament - OOV of a OOV of OOV cooperation .
OOV a OOV OOV , the OOV of OOV cooperation OOV of OOV OOV OOV OOV which are OOV OOV OOV .
This will not OOV to the OOV you are OOV for .
I should like to call this a ' Swedish OOV ' .
You must OOV that , in order to have OOV , the OOV of OOV cooperation needs to be OOV .
<P> In the OOV of the OOV OOV , it is important that we OOV a OOV OOV of the EU in which the national OOV and the European Parliament take an OOV part .
I hope you take up the OOV set out by the President of the Commission .
<P> <SPEAKER OOV LANGUAGE="SV" NAME=" OOV " > Madam President , ladies and gentlemen , OOV of the Council , there are OOV points in the programme of the Swedish Presidency which we in the United OOV support .
In our opinion , the OOV - enlargement , the environment and employment - are important as well as OOV .
There are also other positive OOV of the programme which OOV to be OOV .
These OOV measures to OOV OOV in women and the efforts to OOV OOV peace in OOV .
<P> OOV the OOV on enlargement are concerned , we consider it to be of OOV importance that the EU take into OOV the specific needs of the OOV countries and that these countries not be OOV a OOV EU OOV .
<P> In OOV to this OOV , the OOV of the OOV OOV is a OOV .
No OOV to the EU were actually made there which would OOV enlargement .
OOV , the decision process OOV more OOV .
It is also OOV OOV that OOV countries such as the OOV OOV and OOV should have been OOV OOV against in that they will OOV OOV OOV in the European Parliament than EU countries with OOV OOV .
This is an OOV OOV which must be OOV .
OOV first question to the Swedish Presidency is therefore the following : OOV you OOV to deal with , and OOV , this OOV in the OOV OOV which are now about to be OOV ?
<P> OOV EU countries want to OOV citizens of the future EU countries from the Union ' s OOV market for a long OOV .
OOV OOV is not OOV .
OOV , it is of OOV importance that all those working in an EU country should be OOV to OOV that country ' s OOV and OOV on the OOV market , so that OOV OOV does not result in OOV where social OOV are concerned .
<P> OOV OOV OOV must give OOV priority to employment even in OOV of economic policy , OOV of to the OOV OOV which OOV OOV the EU and economic and OOV OOV .
OOV a policy would also OOV OOV OOV of the European OOV OOV .
OOV of their political OOV , OOV EU OOV have , however , made the OOV to OOV their priority , rather than OOV and the OOV against OOV .
This policy must be OOV .
<P> In various OOV of the European Union , there are OOV OOV for the OOV OOV and OOV OOV we are OOV today to be OOV by a situation in which OOV OOV is OOV by political decisions .
OOV of the OOV being made is for OOV on OOV OOV , a OOV OOV OOV .
OOV OOV of the Swedish Government have OOV in positive terms about this OOV .
OOV - during this presidency - is your OOV opportunity to take OOV .
OOV second question to the presidency is therefore the following : What OOV OOV a ' OOV OOV ' are you OOV during your presidency ?
<P> OOV the next OOV OOV , the most important question OOV environmental issues will be the negotiations in OOV with the OOV OOV to OOV OOV of OOV OOV .
It is extremely important to OOV an agreement over this issue , but even more so to OOV an agreement of OOV .
In our opinion , such an agreement must be OOV upon OOV OOV in OOV and not upon OOV countries ' ( which are already responsible for most OOV ) being given the right to OOV an OOV OOV trade in OOV rights .
<P> OOV s action in the OOV OOV OOV OOV OOV , which was OOV OOV , was OOV .
OOV OOV OOV public OOV of OOV OOV .
We hope that OOV will OOV its OOV and OOV from working towards OOV the OOV OOV OOV which OOV on the issue .
OOV an environmental point of view , EU legislation in this area is still OOV <P> OOV , it OOV that the Swedish Presidency does not want to do OOV to OOV change the OOV s OOV OOV policy which , with the OOV OOV as its OOV , every OOV OOV OOV to new OOV .
OOV , we have OOV how OOV OOV OOV , most OOV by OOV the responsibility OOV by OOV .
This OOV a OOV of OOV of the OOV for OOV OOV , where the OOV of many OOV OOV is in OOV OOV by OOV OOV OOV the European Union .
<P> The OOV OOV OOV OOV s OOV is OOV , however , the OOV of the OOV
OOV only does OOV give up its OOV of OOV and OOV , but it is now also going to work OOV towards OOV the OOV of the OOV
The EU OOV will even OOV OOV OOV .
OOV that one OOV can OOV OOV of OOV in their own country or OOV a OOV country are OOV to OOV in the EU OOV the next OOV .
As a OOV country , OOV also OOV OOV over EU policy in this area in order to make OOV s military resources available .
OOV , my third question to OOV OOV is the following : OOV you OOV that OOV will not be given any such OOV ?
<P> I am OOV forward to the OOV to my three OOV .
These concern the OOV of no OOV OOV against OOV and the OOV OOV under the OOV OOV , what you are going to do to make the OOV OOV a OOV , and how you view OOV ' s OOV in , and OOV over , the OOV s military OOV .
OOV these words , the United OOV would like to wish the Swedish Presidency every OOV .
<P> <SPEAKER OOV NAME=" OOV " > Madam President , OOV , I wish the Swedish Presidency every OOV in the OOV that their OOV will certainly be Europe 's OOV as well .
<P> I want to welcome the Swedish Presidency 's OOV here this OOV as one that OOV to be extremely OOV and OOV .
I also welcome the OOV made by the Commission President , Mr OOV .
<P> The Swedish government has made it clear that it OOV to OOV what is OOV as the OOV OOV during its presidency of the Union , and this OOV to OOV the OOV problems of enlargement of the Union , employment OOV and OOV environmental issues .
<P> I would certainly welcome the OOV of the enlargement negotiations between the OOV countries and the European Union .
We should OOV that the OOV negotiations are OOV up into OOV OOV different OOV of OOV , OOV every OOV of social and economic OOV that is OOV out by the European Union .
OOV , many of the more difficult OOV of OOV still OOV OOV , and these OOV agricultural issues , the OOV OOV of OOV , the implementation of EU social and employment legislation and the OOV of many EU OOV and OOV in the field of environmental OOV .
<P> This is the OOV of the problem when it OOV to the issue of enlargement of the European Union .
OOV countries want the EU OOV to give a OOV OOV for the next enlargement of the Union .
However , the EU OOV are OOV the OOV of the more difficult OOV of OOV between the OOV countries and the European Union before such a OOV can be OOV .
<P> However , the fact that EU OOV were able to agree a OOV of the OOV OOV within the EU OOV at OOV before OOV is certainly a OOV in the right OOV .
OOV countries can now take OOV from the fact that the EU has OOV its OOV OOV OOV so that the OOV of the enlargement process can take place in a OOV and OOV OOV .
<P> I welcome the fact that the Swedish government is going to ensure that employment and environmental OOV OOV at the OOV of the OOV during its presidency of the Union .
It is OOV that the European Union OOV that the OOV of new information OOV are OOV OOV all OOV of European industry .
OOV , it is important that there is an OOV of support for employment OOV in OOV and OOV OOV .
<P> Finally , I hope that the European Union and the United States of OOV can come to an agreement in OOV in OOV of this year so as to OOV that environmental OOV to OOV the OOV of OOV OOV can be OOV .
<P> <SPEAKER OOV LANGUAGE="FR" NAME=" OOV " > Madam President , Mr OOV of the Council , President of the Commission , I would like to thank you for OOV and for your OOV OOV .
If you will OOV me , I would like to ask you a OOV question on an OOV matter .
In a few OOV ' time , the Union is OOV to make a OOV on OOV .
It will have to OOV a common position .
in recent OOV , the OOV Council OOV an OOV on just the OOV .
Mr President , I would like to know if the European Union will also OOV this position .
<P> As to the future of the European Union , we have given OOV over to a certain OOV of OOV , OOV to make an OOV .
OOV OOV that we will vote against the Treaty of OOV , a OOV OOV action , I feel .
There has been no OOV on democracy , no OOV on the OOV of law ; the OOV OOV of the Commission was OOV in OOV .
OOV OOV and , I hope , the OOV , will OOV come out against this Treaty .
<P> OOV said that , we are used to a great deal of OOV of OOV in the House and we will have to see what will OOV when Parliament OOV the OOV to vote .
Mr OOV , I am not OOV if you should be too concerned , since the OOV has many things to OOV us .
I am not , of course , Mr President , OOV you to make a OOV against the Treaty of OOV , I am OOV OOV for your OOV .
At the OOV of the Treaty of OOV , the Council , of which you were a OOV , OOV Parliament a OOV in the OOV of the OOV of OOV Rights in order to OOV it OOV .
A OOV too OOV , Parliament OOV that this was indeed its OOV and , this is the important point , that this was what you OOV at OOV in the way you OOV it , in other words , the OOV of OOV in the Council and the OOV of the Commission .
<P> OOV said that , at OOV , it was no OOV that was OOV to Parliament , Mr OOV , but a OOV OOV .
OOV an OOV OOV in OOV to Parliament and the Commission is like OOV a OOV OOV because there will be no Parliament in OOV .
We will be OOV with the OOV OOV for the OOV in OOV and OOV OOV and then with the OOV OOV OOV in OOV , OOV and OOV .
The OOV will be OOV in OOV , then we will have a OOV OOV in OOV and OOV .
There will be the OOV OOV OOV in OOV , the great OOV issue in OOV and OOV and OOV the OOV OOV in OOV .
Mr President , from now on , if you could OOV a OOV OOV and ask your OOV in the Council OOV to OOV forward this OOV to OOV or to OOV it OOV OOV , you may be able to OOV the OOV of Parliament , which very often does not OOV to know the OOV of the OOV .
<SPEAKER OOV OOV NAME=" OOV " > Madam President , the Group for a Europe of OOV and OOV would like to OOV OOV on the Presidency .
We think it is a good OOV for the presidency to OOV .
We are OOV forward to the OOV OOV and hope that a great many citizens will be there under the OOV OOV .
We call upon the presidency of the Council to OOV the negotiations on the Treaty of OOV so that this can be OOV OOV .
At present , the OOV is more OOV and less OOV democracy .
It is also OOV that the negotiations OOV with a decision to OOV all OOV in OOV , with the Swedish OOV OOV ' s not OOV about this decision when we OOV he was involved in making it .
It is OOV that OOV and OOV can be OOV as OOV and be given OOV OOV in Parliament than countries with OOV OOV .
It is OOV to OOV OOV OOV for the OOV of OOV the OOV countries ' OOV .
In that way , they of course become the OOV s OOV in the Member States OOV of the Member States ' OOV in the OOV
OOV an EU government OOV through OOV OOV , an EU State is on the OOV OOV of the OOV ' s OOV OOV of a Europe of OOV and OOV .
We call upon OOV to OOV OOV OOV in the negotiations on enlargement so that the OOV of the countries can be involved in the OOV work and OOV in the next OOV to the EU Parliament in OOV .
The Treaty of OOV has been OOV an enlargement OOV , but it is a OOV OOV which OOV the OOV and OOV of OOV in Parliament , OOV the OOV enlargement OOV of the Treaty of OOV is to OOV .
We call upon the Swedish Presidency to ensure that an OOV Treaty of OOV only OOV into OOV when the EU OOV new countries .
OOV , we shall in fact end up OOV OOV to a OOV of enlargement , without OOV any enlargement .
We OOV the OOV of the Treaty of OOV ' s OOV OOV a OOV for OOV the Union , with more Union and less democracy , and that is something I am OOV would not be to the OOV of the new Swedish OOV of the Council .
<SPEAKER OOV LANGUAGE="DE " NAME=" OOV " > .
( OOV ) Madam President , Mr OOV of the Council , Mr President of the Commission , ladies and gentlemen , I may OOV to be OOV my OOV OOV today , yet I cannot get OOV from the fact that in OOV , as before in OOV , we once again OOV that as an OOV the OOV OOV is OOV .
On the other hand , I do not believe the OOV OOV is fully OOV yet as a OOV .
It could , however , OOV as the OOV for a OOV OOV .
So in regard to the OOV of OOV between the Member States and the Union , a question OOV both by the President of the Council and by the President of the Commission , OOV me OOV my OOV of an OOV OOV .
<P> OOV a first OOV , OOV to the OOV OOV under the Swedish Presidency , at the OOV of the European Council and in fact as OOV as possible there should be a OOV and OOV process at the level of the national OOV , which would then , just like the European Parliament , have to OOV a proposal by , say , OOV OOV on this OOV of OOV .
OOV on that basis should a OOV be OOV , with the OOV of OOV OOV , OOV in European law , OOV of the national OOV , of the European Parliament , of the national OOV , but also of the OOV of the OOV OOV and , of course , of the Court of OOV and of civil society .
They would be OOV with OOV a proposal for a OOV , and to do so by OOV OOV OOV .
On the basis of that proposal , the Commission in OOV would be OOV by the European Council , in OOV OOV , to OOV a proposal to it on the OOV of OOV which could OOV OOV by the end of OOV .
<P> In OOV OOV , I am OOV rather more OOV than the Commission President before the OOV OOV is OOV , this proposal would have to be OOV for OOV OOV at national level , which would have to OOV by OOV .
OOV , in OOV OOV , the OOV OOV would be OOV , which should be OOV and OOV .
In that way , we will ensure that we have a OOV that OOV OOV the national OOV , which has not been possible so far with the OOV , and that an agreed proposal is OOV to the OOV of Government .
OOV of the OOV OOV OOV by OOV , as they have done in the OOV , they would therefore be OOV together .
<SPEAKER OOV LANGUAGE="DE " NAME=" OOV " > .
( OOV ) Madam President , in order to OOV all OOV I would now like to make a OOV .
On OOV , OOV OOV OOV had its first OOV case of OOV
OOV me to OOV the House that the OOV in OOV OOV us OOV that the results were OOV .
I hope the same will OOV to all future OOV OOV in OOV .
<P> <SPEAKER OOV LANGUAGE="SV" NAME=" OOV " > Madam President , Mr OOV of the Council , ladies and gentlemen , OOV , it is so OOV to see OOV OOV the presidency of the EU for the first time .
We OOV have always OOV for OOV in Europe , but OOV we have to point out that OOV is only responsible for OOV a presidency ' since it is OOV , OOV , which will be responsible for the issues OOV to the OOV .
On the other hand , we hope that OOV , as the country OOV the presidency , will be able to achieve the OOV OOV in the work of enlargement .
<P> The common security and OOV policy has to be made more OOV during the Swedish Presidency .
OOV in this area has been OOV OOV , but the OOV must now be given some OOV .
OOV between the EU and OOV will be of the OOV importance .
OOV and the OOV to OOV OOV problems are OOV if we are to OOV OOV and if we are to give the EU a OOV role in OOV s military OOV .
I hope , therefore , that the fact that OOV does not even get a OOV in the Swedish programme is more of a OOV OOV than part of a OOV .
<P> In OOV years ' time , the EU will have the most OOV OOV in the world .
OOV is one of those countries which have made the OOV OOV in the development of the new OOV .
We have OOV which are world OOV in OOV and the OOV .
This is OOV OOV to the OOV of OOV which OOV place under the OOV government between OOV and OOV .
The OOV for OOV , OOV , OOV and rail OOV , as well as OOV , were OOV .
At the time , Mr OOV was OOV OOV to these OOV , but he OOV to have OOV his OOV .
I am OOV about this and I hope that OOV , OOV by good OOV , will be able to OOV through this OOV of development .
The OOV OOV will provide an excellent opportunity .
OOV it become a OOV OOV for OOV and OOV .
<P> The debate OOV OOV and OOV trade has OOV OOV attention .
The time has come to get OOV of the OOV s OOV OOV OOV .
The EU , together with the new OOV in the OOV , can OOV OOV OOV for agricultural OOV and the OOV industry .
That , if OOV , will OOV OOV with the OOV of the world .
<P> OOV the OOV OOV which OOV the Swedish Government , I find it OOV that the Swedish Presidency OOV in its OOV that one of its main OOV is to OOV itself to making the EU OOV the OOV of development within the OOV towards OOV OOV .
This OOV is OOV in OOV with OOV s OOV of OOV trade and OOV towards the OOV world .
The OOV of OOV in OOV , Mr OOV , has , however , OOV the OOV OOV ( as it is OOV ) as a OOV OOV , and the OOV OOV has OOV his OOV OOV of those who , by OOV OOV and OOV , OOV the OOV meeting in OOV .
The OOV OOV is a OOV to the OOV of the world .
A OOV OOV would only OOV to OOV the OOV of the market .
I would therefore like to ask the following question : OOV the OOV of the Council , here before Parliament , give a clear OOV as to whether the Swedish Presidency is for or against the OOV of a OOV OOV ? <SPEAKER OOV LANGUAGE="SV" NAME=" OOV " > Madam President , Members of the Commission , ladies and gentlemen , I am OOV to welcome the OOV OOV of OOV , Mr OOV OOV to Parliament .
I OOV look forward to all OOV , but this presidency is something quite OOV , and my OOV of it OOV particularly high .
<P> In my opinion , the OOV OOV by OOV , the three OOV , are OOV OOV .
They concern a OOV number of important areas well in OOV with the EU OOV .
The most important one is , of course , enlargement .
It is a OOV of OOV OOV to OOV OOV and OOV on our OOV after years of OOV OOV .
I OOV cannot OOV being able to OOV in the OOV of any greater or more important OOV in the whole of my political life .
<P> OOV s OOV of OOV up the process in this area are OOV OOV .
I hope that the negotiations with the first countries can OOV be OOV to a OOV OOV and that a OOV OOV can OOV be set for the OOV of these first countries .
I OOV that this is going to be difficult .
I also OOV that it must be OOV on OOV and that OOV OOV should not be OOV .
But , at the same time , it is important for the OOV of the OOV countries not to give up hope , but to see the OOV at the end of the OOV .
<P> The second priority concerns OOV .
OOV has been OOV on with the issue of employment .
In OOV , the OOV is to OOV employment , social policy , OOV development and economic policy into one OOV policy .
The OOV OOV is the open OOV OOV .
What we in Parliament would like is to have a part to OOV in this OOV - just as we have in the case of legislation - since it is OOV OOV important .
I would like to OOV some OOV to this OOV .
<P> The third priority concerns OOV OOV development .
This is not only a question of economic and social OOV but also of environmental OOV .
The EU is , after all , OOV OOV where environmental policy is concerned .
This is OOV OOV to the fact that those with the least OOV are OOV to OOV decisions , but it is also OOV to the fact that Parliament has the right of OOV on environmental issues .
What is OOV in the OOV is a OOV between environmental policy and the OOV mentioned areas .
OOV a OOV must be made before the meeting in OOV and must be one result of the meeting in OOV .
<P> It was important , especially for the enlargement process , that there was agreement in OOV .
OOV was not OOV well , however - for example , when it OOV to the OOV rules OOV OOV making .
The way in which decisions were made OOV OOV OOV was not good , OOV .
OOV has OOV on its OOV and will OOV the issue of making OOV available to the public .
I OOV that OOV will also OOV OOV the OOV of a more open OOV process .
I OOV hope that OOV can make a contribution to this issue .
<P> I would also like to say a few words about OOV management .
OOV OOV management and military OOV is not the same OOV as OOV , OOV has it OOV involved OOV .
OOV OOV management is about OOV to OOV OOV .
OOV and OOV have been the OOV in OOV OOV OOV to OOV management and in OOV to military action only as a last OOV .
This is good and will be OOV in the future .
There is a OOV OOV in favour of this .
<P> OOV again , I wish to welcome OOV as the country OOV the presidency .
<SPEAKER OOV LANGUAGE="SV" NAME=" OOV " > Madam President , OOV OOV , I too would like to welcome the OOV OOV here .
It is not quite the same as at OOV in the Swedish Parliament , but you get used to it OOV OOV .
<P> OOV issues OOV OOV the three OOV .
OOV me to OOV a OOV one , OOV OOV for OOV .
We were all OOV OOV after the OOV OOV by the OOV of people OOV for their OOV OOV the OOV of OOV in their OOV to get to Europe .
OOV people OOV in their OOV for a better life .
I know that you , OOV OOV , OOV your OOV after the OOV OOV last year when OOV OOV people were OOV OOV in a OOV in OOV .
<P> Europe must not be OOV into some OOV of OOV .
The European OOV and OOV policy must be OOV by OOV and OOV - that was your OOV at the time .
But what has OOV since ?
OOV , the development in Europe has taken a OOV OOV .
<P> It has been OOV that the OOV for OOV in human OOV be made more OOV .
This is necessary , but the proposals are OOV in their OOV .
OOV organisations - OOV , OOV OOV , OOV organisations and OOV OOV which support OOV OOV - are OOV with OOV .
These proposals must be OOV .
In OOV , OOV against the OOV of the OOV of OOV has OOV since the OOV OOV .
<P> European OOV should OOV on why OOV in human OOV to Europe is OOV OOV .
Europe is being OOV .
OOV OOV a OOV OOV on OOV countries is not OOV of a OOV Europe .
The OOV OOV must be that people have the right to OOV OOV to the OOV
OOV the Swedish Presidency OOV to work towards making the OOV of countries from which OOV are OOV OOV OOV ?
<P> I am an OOV OOV of the EU and have for a long time now OOV to see common rules within the OOV and OOV policy , but we OOV are not OOV to OOV any OOV of OOV ' Europe .
This , OOV OOV , is an opportunity for the new presidency to make an important contribution towards OOV and human OOV in the OOV of OOV OOV , OOV OOV you have so OOV OOV .
OOV is the OOV OOV .
<SPEAKER OOV OOV " NAME=" OOV " > Mr President , as OOV of the people and the regions , we regard OOV as an OOV in our OOV of things that are OOV to us , such as OOV and cultural OOV , but if you are going to OOV about OOV the national OOV more we would want the same OOV of attention to be OOV to the OOV of our OOV regions , and of our OOV .
We would like our regions to be able to OOV in OOV OOV , so as to OOV the OOV in employment OOV that can OOV between different regions and one Member State .
<P> We welcome OOV as an OOV OOV presidency , but OOV would be OOV OOV out of OOV if it were to OOV OOV OOV to OOV .
This would be in OOV OOV with the OOV of OOV , under the terms of which all parties are OOV upon to OOV the OOV OOV .
<P> Finally , enlargement .
OOV only is it OOV to the enlargement to see the OOV OOV adopted in the OOV OOV OOV , more than OOV we want attention to be given to the OOV OOV .
I am OOV democracy , respect for human rights and OOV , so that Europe is able to become a real OOV of OOV , in OOV , a Community with a OOV OOV .
<SPEAKER OOV OOV " NAME=" OOV " > Mr President , the programme of the Swedish Presidency is a OOV OOV of work , but there is still no OOV as to how it is to be OOV at a OOV level .
OOV does the presidency OOV to OOV this OOV programme ?
As well as the Swedish OOV , there are all the OOV OOV OOV by the OOV still to be OOV with .
<P> This is the first time that OOV has OOV the presidency of the European Union and it has OOV made enlargement an important priority .
But is it not taking a rather OOV view of how much OOV there is within the European Union to OOV the OOV OOV ?
The decision not to OOV OOV in OOV to OOV OOV of a OOV OOV of OOV , given that this is OOV by the OOV OOV .
It is important for the OOV OOV to be OOV a OOV future , in OOV , OOV an increase in employment OOV and the OOV of OOV development through OOV OOV .
The OOV of OOV as many OOV OOV as possible with the OOV OOV over the next OOV OOV , is a OOV one .
<P> However , we would do well to consider that the OOV market must be able to continue to OOV OOV in the OOV Union .
OOV it OOV to the enlargement negotiations , how does the presidency OOV to deal with the OOV that have not been OOV OOV in the current Member States for some time ?
<P> On a OOV OOV , the proposal to OOV environmental OOV into other policy areas , such as OOV of energy , is to be OOV with open OOV .
This OOV is an excellent point of OOV for the OOV environmental action programme , as are the OOV OOV and OOV that are to be OOV in this programme .
However , it is still OOV to me as to how this is to be OOV with the OOV OOV of the OOV .
<SPEAKER OOV OOV " OOV OOV " > Mr President , OOV has every right to be OOV of its policy of making OOV rights for OOV and women a OOV .
You can OOV that I was rather OOV to see just how OOV your own OOV is .
<P> A OOV OOV of your OOV of OOV is that the people of the European Union should be our first priority .
OOV I come from a country that OOV great OOV by the OOV : OOV words but OOV ' and you will OOV have this opportunity .
For example there is a OOV on the OOV which OOV OOV to OOV from the Council , the Commission and Parliament .
There are OOV OOV I would like to ask you .
<P> OOV , what do you OOV to do with the OOV OOV Commission proposal in this OOV ?
<P> OOV second question is this : are you going to OOV OOV the current OOV Council proposal with a view to OOV greater OOV ?
<P> OOV , are you OOV to get OOV to a OOV start in OOV the Council working OOV together , so as to be able to OOV an OOV with Parliament as OOV as possible ?
<P> OOV , will you OOV the OOV of OOV change and make the Council OOV available on the OOV now , OOV OOV OOV into OOV ?
<P> OOV OOV question is : do you consider that European citizens are less OOV to OOV with regard to the OOV OOV than OOV citizens are as OOV their OOV OOV ?
<P> OOV , a OOV question : do you have the OOV to OOV your own process of OOV in OOV to the OOV OOV , of OOV the OOV put forward by the President of the Commission ?
What would your OOV be to that ?
I think , Mr OOV of the Council , that it is extremely important for us not just to OOV OOV words , but OOV all , what will your OOV be ? <SPEAKER OOV LANGUAGE="FR" NAME=" OOV " > Mr OOV of the Council , I wish OOV good OOV in its first presidency .
The three OOV are three good OOV that we OOV .
I would like to OOV OOV about enlargement .
We support this as much as you do .
It must be OOV .
We must OOV OOV that OOV is OOV OOV on our OOV to OOV our OOV OOV OOV as well .
The OOV of OOV is not a good OOV .
You will have to deal with it .
<P> However , to OOV on to your second priority , employment , which OOV to my OOV position in Parliament .
In the course of its development , the Union had OOV years to OOV for the OOV market , but with OOV OOV OOV .
It was the same for the OOV .
We are OOV taking on the new OOV of OOV employment and even OOV a OOV to full employment , as some OOV to say at the OOV OOV , with our OOV and we have all OOV what could be OOV without OOV OOV OOV .
This means , however , that we should OOV OOV and OOV OOV .
This OOV means better OOV between OOV , especially , in our case , OOV policy , and employment policy in the European Union .
Mr President , you will be OOV the new European Council in the OOV , which will be the first Council to deal with general OOV OOV OOV with employment OOV .
You will set a OOV by OOV OOV and by OOV OOV to OOV results , rather than OOV OOV .
We also need OOV of all the various OOV of European policy in order to OOV employment .
OOV OOV policy is one of the OOV OOV and one that OOV the best .
OOV its only OOV be to achieve OOV economic OOV ?
OOV and OOV are OOV OOV .
What is their OOV OOV in terms of employment and OOV ?
The Commission OOV the current OOV .
The Council would OOV be well OOV to OOV the OOV of these OOV .
OOV should also work in favour of employment .
We have the same need for OOV policy OOV in the Union OOV of public OOV OOV OOV or in the OOV for services of general interest .
I did have more OOV but I am out of time .
Mr President , Parliament is a place where we do not actually debate very much .
You will get used to it and you will find it does not OOV you too much .
It certainly OOV me .
<SPEAKER OOV LANGUAGE="SV" NAME=" OOV " > Mr President , OOV of the Council , I should like to OOV OOV OOV OOV on an OOV and OOV programme .
I hope it means that the EU will take OOV OOV forward and that it will also OOV the OOV of the EU in OOV .
<P> OOV the issues OOV to people ' s OOV , one of the most important OOV is that of OOV safety .
I have OOV that the OOV OOV has OOV his OOV about OOV OOV in view of the OOV in which OOV and OOV OOV are OOV .
OOV the fact that I am an OOV OOV and an OOV OOV , I can OOV OOV people who feel like that .
<P> Parliament will be OOV OOV on some OOV OOV safety OOV .
We are now OOV to OOV the proposal for a European OOV OOV .
I would be OOV to OOV what the OOV OOV ' s OOV is to such an OOV .
<P> In a common market , common rules and OOV as well as common OOV , and - if the rules are not OOV - a common system of OOV are OOV .
OOV an OOV OOV OOV more than the OOV OOV OOV .
OOV opinion is that it has to OOV in cooperation with the OOV s OOV and OOV OOV in OOV and with the Commission .
OOV the OOV of OOV of such a OOV , OOV and OOV , OOV OOV , OOV management and OOV could be OOV with within the framework of OOV OOV OOV and could provide an OOV level of OOV safety OOV the Union .
I hope to have the support of the presidency for this OOV .
<SPEAKER OOV LANGUAGE="SV" NAME=" OOV " > Mr President , OOV of the Council and the Commission , ladies and gentlemen , it is very OOV that the Swedish Presidency has OOV the environment a high priority .
This is OOV necessary , and it also OOV responsibility .
<P> OOV OOV the OOV in the OOV environment OOV OOV political decisions - a OOV in the OOV .
OOV are high in view of the OOV of Mr OOV , the OOV of the Council , to the OOV that OOV development on the OOV s OOV will OOV to a OOV OOV for the OOV OOV .
This OOV OOV the OOV with OOV OOV , OOV environmental issues in all other OOV and OOV the necessary means of OOV .
It is therefore OOV that the Swedish Government is OOV in OOV to such OOV OOV at EU level as OOV OOV of OOV OOV and energy OOV .
OOV was a OOV decision made on this in OOV ? <P> OOV question of great OOV interest is how the Swedish Presidency is OOV to OOV the OOV - which it has OOV from OOV - of OOV a OOV for the political future of the OOV
You , Mr OOV of the Council - OOV with a OOV OOV of the OOV of the Member States - are , of course , OOV to a OOV development of the OOV
What is your OOV and how do you OOV OOV and the OOV of OOV in the future ?
<P> OOV is the President OOV OOV to OOV a Swedish policy of OOV and OOV OOV , at the same time , his OOV during the presidency is to continue to OOV the OOV s military OOV ? <P> Finally , I would like to OOV the Swedish Presidency .
<SPEAKER OOV LANGUAGE="ES " NAME=" OOV OOV > Mr President , I would OOV like to wish the Swedish Presidency of the European Union OOV .
<P> As the OOV of the Council OOV , the work of a presidency does not OOV OOV of OOV its national interests , but also of OOV OOV so that European OOV may OOV forward .
OOV the only way to OOV forward is to OOV OOV cooperation between the three OOV : the Council , the Commission and Parliament .
We are therefore OOV to OOV the OOV of cooperation you made Parliament today , especially in view of the OOV to which Mr OOV OOV just now , in which , OOV , you OOV that the Commission is an OOV OOV from a serious OOV OOV and that , following the OOV OOV and the OOV OOV of citizens in your country , the European Parliament should be OOV .
I do not know whether these reports are OOV or not , or whether they have been OOV or not , but I believe , Mr President , that these OOV OOV some OOV .
<P> OOV said that , when OOV the Europe of OOV , you OOV to the need to OOV the system of the OOV of OOV Rights to third countries .
I do not know OOV what you OOV by that .
If we are to OOV third countries to OOV to certain OOV , to which we have not OOV been OOV of OOV , then OOV the most OOV OOV is that you have now become a OOV OOV of making the OOV of OOV Rights OOV in OOV and OOV even including it in the OOV .
<P> In OOV your OOV , you OOV to the European Union OOV , which you OOV as an OOV of OOV OOV .
The OOV OOV of a Europe with OOV on the OOV , on OOV , the OOV OOV and the OOV OOV , is a OOV but OOV OOV of Europe .
Mr OOV of the Council , the Europe of OOV must be OOV to a Europe of OOV , since the OOV of the European Union is an OOV OOV for peace , OOV , OOV and OOV , and we would OOV your OOV to OOV this in OOV .
<SPEAKER OOV LANGUAGE="SV" NAME=" OOV " > Mr President , President of the Commission , ladies and gentlemen , it is , of course , not possible for me to OOV on all the OOV , but I can OOV some of the main OOV of OOV of the OOV .
OOV , I will not go into OOV OOV to Swedish OOV policy , since we can deal with such OOV in other OOV .
OOV , I will OOV on the major European issues .
<P> I OOV a OOV OOV on the part of OOV of the OOV - not least on the part of the OOV of the OOV political OOV - to work together with the presidency towards greater OOV .
This is an issue on which , as you all know , there are different OOV within the Union , which is why we are going to have a difficult and OOV OOV on our OOV over the next few OOV .
OOV , we think that one of the OOV OOV for OOV OOV in the European Union , in its OOV and its OOV is that there be OOV ; that it be possible to OOV the way in which an issue is OOV with ; that OOV can be OOV ; and that debate can be OOV in .
In that way , a European political OOV can be OOV for OOV a debate , which in OOV is the OOV for OOV OOV which will go on to OOV OOV OOV OOV .
What has been said by Mr OOV , Mr OOV OOV and OOV on this subject is , of course , excellent and something to which I OOV .
<P> OOV have OOV to enlargement , especially Mr OOV OOV in his OOV OOV OOV .
I have also been OOV by Mrs OOV whether we can OOV a OOV for when the first OOV country will OOV OOV to the Union .
This is something which I - which we - wish to see , but we are not going to give that OOV .
We will not OOV that debate OOV we know that the OOV negotiations which will have to be OOV are also to be OOV .
I think we would be OOV the OOV OOV if we were to OOV a certain point in time when the first of the countries OOV OOV OOV were to OOV the Union .
It would be the OOV OOV because we would first like to see the difficult negotiations with which we are OOV result in a OOV .
OOV a OOV can take place during the Swedish Presidency and we may then very well be able to OOV a OOV in OOV .
I hope that this will be the case .
I would like it to OOV , but I am not OOV if it will .
<P> OOV we OOV about the major issues and enlargement , it OOV that we are more or less in agreement .
There is no OOV support for enlargement than that OOV by the European Parliament .
This is more a OOV of the European Parliament than of any other OOV .
It is Parliament that has been responsible for enlargement .
OOV , I am extremely OOV that it should also be possible for the Treaty we OOV in OOV to be OOV , because that in OOV is the OOV for its being possible to OOV enlargement .
I hope we can OOV the OOV on OOV OOV which OOV between the Commission , the Council and Parliament so that we can make some progress on the issue of enlargement .
OOV is our common responsibility , an OOV opportunity to put an end to the OOV of Europe into OOV and OOV .
<P> I agree with what Mr OOV said in his OOV , to the OOV that the Treaty of OOV - OOV its OOV and OOV - OOV OOV the OOV to enlargement , something which it is important to OOV .
<P> In their OOV , OOV Members have also OOV about the environmental issue .
I OOV great OOV to the OOV of Mrs OOV and OOV .
In my opinion , the environmental issue should not be OOV as a OOV on economic development but , OOV , as a OOV OOV .
OOV the major environmental problems we see at present will be OOV by new OOV .
This is something of which I am OOV .
I am also OOV that we , in OOV , already have the OOV .
It is available .
We know what , in all OOV , needs to be done .
OOV our citizens see what is OOV , for example on the OOV issue , and that we cannot get together and OOV some OOV of OOV OOV , that is OOV something which will OOV OOV in our OOV .
I therefore believe that the OOV OOV will be an important point of OOV , OOV us to OOV that there is a OOV to OOV OOV new OOV , OOV , development and OOV in human OOV are in OOV fact OOV through political OOV .
If we place the OOV on this , we shall also be at the OOV OOV of the OOV development which is a OOV for a OOV Europe .
OOV at environmental concern as a OOV OOV and not as a OOV and as OOV for a time which has OOV .
OOV at environmental concern as a OOV contribution to a better and more OOV Europe .
We OOV to be able to OOV that approach OOV the OOV work Commissioner OOV is OOV with OOV environmental OOV programme for issues OOV to OOV and the way in which the use of these is OOV .
OOV all this together , and we should be able to OOV a OOV OOV in OOV .
I take OOV of what you have said about the environmental issue and I OOV your OOV to a great OOV .
<P> OOV is , of course , OOV a policy which already is , and for the OOV future will OOV , a responsibility of the national OOV .
In the open OOV which is a OOV of the OOV process , we have OOV a way of OOV OOV the development of employment in the Union .
I fully OOV Mr OOV ' s view that , if we are to come OOV still to full employment , the OOV OOV is going to become OOV more OOV .
OOV put it more OOV : how can we make use of the fact that we are OOV within a European OOV in order , for example , to provide more OOV for economic OOV ?
OOV situation is such that we are not OOV to OOV OOV .
OOV OOV country is OOV , but not so a OOV of countries .
This is something we should OOV , and - I OOV OOV this - it is particularly important in the case of those countries which are already OOV over the OOV .
They have more OOV of taking OOV of their situation or of OOV more OOV economic OOV and , in that way , OOV employment .
I am quite OOV that OOV of this OOV will take place in the group of OOV countries .
OOV all , the work which OOV the OOV of the European Union has to do with the OOV market and that OOV of working in terms of OOV legislation that is in the OOV of OOV .
That OOV has , of course , already been OOV .
What has now been OOV is cooperation within another field , something which we , for OOV , call the OOV process .
There are different OOV .
OOV of which form of cooperation we OOV , the same OOV for OOV and OOV OOV .
I do not wish to see a situation in which States and OOV OOV OOV between themselves which could be OOV as being OOV and OOV and which make public OOV OOV .
OOV of which OOV we OOV , OOV is of OOV importance .
<P> OOV other things have been said which I feel OOV about , but OOV me just say that there are two OOV which I find to be of a OOV and OOV OOV , but which are of OOV political importance and which , I want to OOV , I have OOV to .
What Mr OOV OOV about OOV policy , OOV quality , the interest of OOV in their right to OOV and the OOV of OOV OOV is very much in OOV with my own OOV OOV the presidency ' s approach .
<P> Mr OOV OOV OOV about policy on OOV and about a OOV OOV on the part of the European Union towards those who OOV to us in OOV of safety and OOV .
The OOV OOV must , of course , form the basis of any OOV about this subject , but we should also have OOV over and OOV this .
As a OOV OOV of a OOV OOV , we really should be able to OOV such a policy .
OOV , not OOV .
These are OOV we could very well have OOV and OOV about , and it is an area in which we could take the Union OOV .
I am very OOV to what Mr OOV OOV said in his OOV about a OOV OOV policy .
<P> In OOV , I would like to say that those of us involved in the Swedish Presidency will OOV be in your OOV OOV to OOV OOV and OOV , but we would also like you , for your part , to get in OOV with OOV .
We will also be OOV to OOV you as OOV in our OOV OOV and OOV country , a country which , however , will be full of OOV and OOV on such OOV .
OOV that I can OOV you .
You are all very welcome .
I am OOV forward to OOV with all the political OOV in Parliament with a view to OOV the European Union .
<SPEAKER OOV LANGUAGE="DE " NAME=" OOV " > .
( OOV ) Mr President , I want to thank the Presidency of the Council for taking such a positive approach to the OOV OOV and OOV at economic OOV , which OOV in the interests of full employment , economic OOV , OOV and the future OOV of the European Union .
What we need in OOV is not a OOV OOV .
We need a OOV that OOV it clear at what European Union level we can OOV OOV best , so that we really can make progress in OOV the OOV market in the interests not just of the OOV but also of the people , of the workers .
<P> So I would like to make a OOV to the Swedish Presidency .
If you want to OOV greater OOV and greater democracy , OOV in OOV to OOV economic policy , make a start by OOV the European Parliament in the OOV OOV , in every initiative and in OOV the OOV OOV of economic policy .
<P> We will first OOV our proposals in the framework of a OOV OOV .
We will see whether the Swedish Presidency really is taking this issue of OOV the OOV OOV on OOV and is OOV OOV , by small OOV .
That is a very OOV OOV by the European Parliament , which has been OOV since OOV for an OOV agreement of that OOV to be OOV .
<P> I would ask the presidency to OOV the OOV process OOV , OOV that all policy areas OOV to in it OOV the same OOV .
That means we really do OOV an appropriate and OOV policy OOV , by OOV a policy of social OOV , full employment and economic OOV OOV on clear OOV together with quality OOV .
The same OOV to financial policy , for we must OOV by making it clear through our OOV policy that the people of Europe can achieve OOV OOV through cooperation at European level , through OOV in people , but also in OOV .
<P> OOV me OOV one last OOV to the Swedish Presidency : we place our OOV in you to ensure that the citizens of Europe , most of OOV are very OOV , can OOV the OOV of the OOV without OOV .
OOV work very OOV with the OOV Presidency and call on all the OOV in the OOV , OOV and OOV to OOV .
For the OOV is a OOV OOV OOV that can only OOV if we all OOV together .
<P> <SPEAKER OOV NAME=" OOV " > Mr President , Commissioner , as you OOV from our Group OOV OOV in the debate , the OOV OOV OOV last OOV .
OOV OOV , I and some OOV were able to OOV OOV where of course the OOV OOV place where President OOV , OOV OOV OOV - OOV OOV by Mr OOV OOV - and OOV OOV agreed to OOV the OOV OOV of Europe .
The Swedish Presidency , as we have OOV during the debate , has OOV high OOV that we may achieve over the next OOV OOV the OOV of a OOV Europe , but I believe the time for OOV has OOV and what we are all OOV for now are results .
I OOV if OOV OOV could be OOV to the Swedish Presidency .
<P> OOV of all , does it OOV to OOV a OOV or a OOV meeting to which the government OOV of the OOV countries would be OOV , not only to OOV the negotiations , but to give the important OOV to the public that enlargement is not OOV a political OOV , a OOV , a OOV OOV OOV , but that we are OOV making the progress which is OOV ?
<P> OOV , could the OOV negotiations be OOV by an OOV of the OOV ?
It does OOV OOV difficult in a OOV that the way the enlargement process is OOV is OOV a question of OOV to some OOV OOV , OOV , OOV , the specific OOV that the OOV OOV and other OOV and OOV European countries OOV under the OOV system .
<P> OOV the OOV which we have set OOV : does the Swedish Presidency agree that this OOV OOV OOV , and , OOV , can we OOV that no new OOV will be OOV in the OOV of the OOV countries .
<P> OOV today it has been OOV 's OOV .
We all very much hope that in OOV OOV ' time in OOV , once again , it will not only be OOV 's OOV , but Europe 's OOV .
<SPEAKER OOV NAME=" OOV " > Mr President , I OOV welcome the Swedish Presidency , although the situation in which they find themselves as they OOV the presidency may not be a very OOV one .
We have OOV had OOV the most OOV OOV the EU has OOV OOV .
OOV are being OOV out right up to the time the agreement is about to be OOV , and that does not , on any account , give a good OOV of OOV OOV or the work of the Council .
For that reason , it is very OOV to OOV that OOV , as the country OOV the presidency , has OOV its OOV to help OOV the work of the Council in a OOV more OOV OOV .
<P> The programme of the Swedish Presidency is OOV and OOV , and it really is time environmental issues in their OOV OOV were OOV taken to the OOV of any debate in the European Union .
The programme of OOV development OOV for the EU , which has been agreed will form part of the OOV OOV process at the OOV OOV , must OOV all those OOV of OOV that have been OOV for the presidency of the OOV
In my opinion , all three OOV s are a OOV of this OOV .
<P> But I am OOV OOV OOV , and I will now OOV my words to the Commission , about the OOV for OOV the OOV for debate , for example , for the OOV OOV .
OOV will this OOV make it possible for the European Parliament to be fully involved in the OOV of the programme OOV to OOV development , for example ?
However , I would like to thank the country OOV the presidency for including the issue of the OOV OOV on the OOV .
OOV I would once more like to OOV a question to the Commission , which is how OOV resources - OOV resources , for example - can be OOV so that this OOV OOV policy also OOV the OOV for an OOV from the Commission .
<SPEAKER OOV LANGUAGE="SV" NAME=" OOV " > Mr President , I too should like to welcome the Swedish Presidency and its programme which OOV many good OOV .
OOV like a whole OOV of OOV here today , I am OOV about the OOV to OOV and OOV OOV the OOV OOV at the OOV of the OOV we OOV call the ' Community approach ' , OOV OOV . one which OOV the Commission ' s being given a greater role and importance .
<P> I OOV the OOV OOV ' s OOV of OOV , OOV of which OOV is OOV , but the question is , of course , more OOV than that .
The OOV contribution by Commissioner OOV OOV the OOV we OOV .
<P> I OOV with interest to the OOV OOV ' s OOV on the environmental issues .
They OOV OOV , but there is a problem in that the OOV of today ' s environmental problems are OOV OOV to energy OOV , and the problem is that Europe at present has no energy policy .
The Member States have not even OOV to agree about a common OOV on OOV OOV .
The Swedish Government has OOV that it OOV to see such a OOV , but only if a OOV decision on this can be OOV which , however , is the same OOV as no decision at all .
For OOV years , this question has been OOV by OOV OOV .
What OOV the OOV OOV and the Government think that it could be OOV at this present time ?
OOV a OOV on OOV OOV , the EU will not be able to OOV the OOV of the OOV OOV .
OOV , the OOV for OOV development , which is going to be taken up for OOV in OOV , will be OOV OOV if the EU does not take a OOV OOV on these energy issues .
Commissioner OOV OOV the issue very OOV , and many other OOV have done the same .
The question is whether the Swedish Government will be OOV to think again .
<P> Finally , I wish to say that I , just like Mr OOV OOV , would have OOV to have OOV a OOV ' OOV ' , OOV for OOV and OOV not only to the OOV issues but also to relations with the OOV OOV .
<P> OOV has been made here today to the OOV OOV , but I think that this will be OOV to OOV .
OOV way of OOV more OOV for OOV issues would be to OOV all Member States to OOV their OOV to OOV OOV OOV OOV of their OOV in aid .
In OOV to this , as Mrs OOV said , the OOV of OOV on OOV from OOV countries should be OOV .
OOV the Swedish Government OOV to OOV in this OOV ?
<SPEAKER OOV LANGUAGE="DE " OOV OOV > Mr President , Mr President of the Council , ladies and gentlemen , this debate has made it very clear that the OOV of Members of the European Parliament is OOV by the OOV of OOV .
The real reason is as OOV .
In OOV , OOV and democracy for the European Union OOV by the OOV .
What OOV ?
We find the Council OOV the OOV OOV principle in more and more areas .
That OOV any OOV by the national OOV , OOV decisions can , of course , be OOV by the OOV OOV in the Council .
<P> But this OOV OOV has , OOV , not been OOV by OOV OOV by the European Parliament OOV , OOV , by OOV by the European Parliament .
OOV , I am OOV , OOV the OOV OOV of what was OOV in OOV .
<P> Mr President of the Council , OOV has a great OOV of democracy and OOV .
I OOV the Swedish Presidency to support us in our OOV to OOV these OOV of OOV and to OOV the OOV of OOV decisions in the European Union again , and I am OOV it will do so .
<P> I want to OOV a second point .
OOV its OOV of OOV the Swedish Presidency must OOV for the OOV of the OOV , OOV OOV . of the OOV and OOV , in OOV European Union countries .
The question we OOV OOV OOV is this : who actually OOV the OOV OOV ?
I am OOV that the European Commission OOV to OOV to do more here than it has to OOV .
The OOV Presidency OOV us clear information .
OOV , the OOV of the OOV EU countries OOV the OOV OOV .
That in OOV OOV to a OOV situation .
The Swedish OOV OOV OOV the European Union OOV for general economic policy OOV , OOV when it OOV to the OOV , to the OOV OOV , this OOV OOV to the OOV OOV OOV .
If even we in the European Parliament cannot OOV that , how are the citizens of the European Union OOV to OOV it ?
OOV are the OOV to OOV it ?
We must do our OOV to OOV to a OOV situation here .
<P> You , OOV OOV , can make a major contribution here .
If you OOV to OOV your OOV that the OOV is a good OOV , that it is OOV from within , that its OOV OOV is also OOV OOV ; if you can OOV them to support this great OOV of European OOV , you will also help ensure that the citizens OOV a better OOV of this OOV of the European Union .
<SPEAKER OOV NAME=" President " > The debate is OOV .
OOV OOV OOV OOV ( Council ) <SPEAKER OOV NAME=" President " > The next OOV is OOV OOV ( OOV ) .
We will OOV OOV to the Council .
<SPEAKER OOV NAME=" OOV OOV OOV " > OOV No OOV by OOV ) : <P> OOV : OOV OOV In a new report the OOV OOV that the OOV OOV OOV OOV is very well OOV and that women are being OOV on OOV OOV OOV .
The OOV are OOV high ( often over EUR OOV OOV ) and the OOV OOV there will be a OOV increase in OOV in OOV women both OOV and to OOV Europe in particular .
<P> At the OOV meeting on OOV OOV 2000 the European Council and Commission OOV the question of responsibility for the OOV of OOV OOV OOV .
OOV the Council also OOV up the problem of the OOV OOV in OOV women and OOV ?
<SPEAKER OOV LANGUAGE="SV" NAME=" OOV " > The Council OOV that it was a very positive development to be able to open a OOV with OOV OOV OOV issues , particularly those OOV OOV OOV and OOV of OOV citizens who have been OOV OOV OOV on Member States ' OOV .
OOV to the OOV meeting with OOV , a meeting was OOV in OOV with OOV from the country OOV the presidency , the Commission and a OOV OOV in order to OOV and OOV areas of possible future cooperation .
OOV OOV was OOV on the OOV of information between authorities and organisations working on issues OOV OOV in human OOV and OOV OOV .
There are OOV for further OOV of the same OOV , and the next one will be OOV in OOV in a few OOV ' time .
OOV for the meeting are OOV under way at OOV level .
<P> As Mrs OOV OOV is aware , the European Council in OOV OOV OOV OOV OOV its concern OOV the OOV OOV in OOV last year and OOV the OOV OOV OOV by OOV OOV by such OOV of human OOV .
The European Council OOV the Union the OOV of OOV cooperation in order to OOV such OOV OOV .
The OOV Presidency OOV to the OOV OOV by the European Council and put forward OOV OOV as OOV in the OOV against the OOV OOV which OOV OOV and OOV in human OOV .
<P> OOV if the specific problem mentioned by Mrs OOV was not OOV at the OOV meeting on OOV OOV of last year , the Council is very much aware of the problem OOV OOV in women and OOV .
It is about OOV not only from OOV , but also from certain other countries not far from the OOV
As the country OOV the presidency , OOV has , in the OOV of the year 2000 and in the OOV of the OOV OOV ( in which OOV also OOV part ) , OOV the issue of OOV in women and OOV .
The first OOV was an OOV ' meeting at the end of OOV last year OOV by OOV in the field from both OOV and Europe .
The OOV from this meeting will be OOV at OOV s meeting of OOV OOV in OOV in OOV of this year .
<SPEAKER OOV LANGUAGE="SV" NAME=" OOV " > Swedish Presidency , I am very OOV that this issue is being OOV OOV by the Council , because it is extremely serious .
OOV of OOV of women and OOV are OOV and OOV in OOV every year , many of them to the OOV .
The most OOV areas are the OOV OOV .
In a new report , OOV has OOV that the authorities in the OOV have OOV with quite serious OOV when they have OOV to get to OOV with OOV in women from OOV , and that this OOV will increase OOV if OOV measures are not OOV .
<P> OOV in women is also OOV within OOV .
As a OOV OOV of the OOV policy and the OOV of OOV OOV for OOV , there are OOV OOV million OOV OOV in OOV .
The OOV OOV against OOV in OOV reports on OOV OOV OOV OOV of women who are then OOV to the OOV OOV in the OOV on the OOV that they are to be OOV .
It is a very good OOV that you OOV this OOV after the OOV OOV .
I OOV whether the OOV organisations , for example OOV and the OOV OOV against OOV in OOV , will be OOV in this Council .
In what way is the Council OOV , by OOV its OOV with OOV , to OOV the matter of OOV in women in OOV to the OOV ?
<SPEAKER OOV LANGUAGE="SV" NAME=" OOV " > There is every reason for the working parties which have now been OOV to OOV and OOV make OOV , within the framework of the Union 's work , with other international organisations working with these issues .
OOV is OOV the OOV with the most OOV in the area .
I OOV that such OOV will be OOV very OOV .
<P> OOV me also to point out that the OOV against OOV in women is in general OOV as an important issue in the programme of the Swedish Presidency .
We will OOV work towards OOV this OOV OOV on a OOV OOV , that is to say , not only with regard to OOV , but OOV .
<SPEAKER OOV NAME=" President " > As the OOV is not present , OOV No OOV OOV .
<SPEAKER OOV NAME=" OOV OOV OOV " > OOV No OOV by OOV ) : <P> OOV : OOV for EU citizens in OOV In OOV with OOV OOV of the OOV Treaty , every OOV of the EU is OOV to OOV in third countries by the OOV of another Member State if the OOV s own country is not OOV there .
What OOV are OOV by the EU for EU citizens in OOV during the OOV ? <SPEAKER OOV LANGUAGE="SV" NAME=" OOV " > The OOV Member should be made aware that two decisions have been adopted in OOV of OOV OOV of the OOV Treaty .
The first concerns OOV for citizens of the European Union from the OOV and OOV OOV .
The second OOV to implementation measures for the OOV decisions .
The OOV to this decision OOV the conditions under which the Member States ' OOV OOV may OOV each EU OOV .
The United OOV is OOV OOV services in OOV during the OOV OOV .
There are OOV OOV in OOV which can OOV EU citizens during the OOV .
<SPEAKER OOV NAME=" OOV " > Mr President , I thank the Swedish OOV for his OOV but it does not OOV my OOV .
OOV is quite right to say that certain OOV of OOV services are OOV in OOV during the OOV by the OOV Government for OOV OOV .
However , those OOV services are not available to OOV from other EU Member States who would be there under the same terms and conditions OOV by the OOV authorities as OOV OOV .
It OOV a OOV OOV that OOV we are OOV to have OOV OOV and OOV for all EU citizens , in OOV like the one I have OOV , there is OOV OOV and OOV OOV for EU citizens .
OOV the Swedish OOV OOV OOV us that he will take up this matter and OOV OOV in which this OOV of OOV OOV OOV place , to ensure that OOV of OOV or OOV people OOV the same OOV from OOV services by OOV Member States ?
<SPEAKER OOV LANGUAGE="SV" NAME=" OOV " > I can not only OOV Mr OOV that the matter will be taken up , I can even OOV OOV that his concern is OOV OOV .
The decision that I OOV to OOV OOV that if the OOV OOV OOV help is a OOV of one of the Member States of the European Union , the OOV or OOV OOV from another Member State shall OOV the OOV OOV help as if he were a OOV of the Member State OOV by the OOV or OOV .
There is therefore no need for the OOV situation OOV by Mr OOV to OOV .
OOV , an EU OOV will be OOV OOV .
I am OOV that , in this case , the United OOV 's OOV is OOV with OOV and OOV all EU citizens OOV .
This is at least OOV in the decisions that have been taken .
<SPEAKER OOV NAME=" President " > <SPEAKER OOV NAME=" OOV OOV > OOV No OOV by OOV ) : <P> OOV : OOV OOV and the OOV OOV system OOV it possible at present to OOV an OOV level of OOV market OOV with regard to OOV with the OOV of OOV OOV at European level ?
<SPEAKER OOV LANGUAGE="SV" NAME=" OOV " > The Council is very OOV to have OOV market OOV so that it is possible to be OOV that the OOV OOV of the OOV OOV to OOV OOV and OOV up on the basis of the OOV approach ' are OOV with .
This approach is a new way of OOV OOV OOV for OOV in the OOV .
<P> The OOV of how this OOV OOV of OOV is used is a common concern for the Commission and the Member States .
It is OOV the Member States ' responsibility to ensure , by means of OOV or in some other way , that these OOV OOV with the OOV for OOV and that they OOV OOV .
The Commission has been OOV a OOV role for OOV OOV and a high OOV with regard to the OOV OOV .
The OOV OOV are national , and the Member States OOV the Commission of which national OOV are to OOV out the OOV .
<P> In OOV , the Commission OOV up programmes to ensure that the market OOV is OOV in a OOV way between the Member States .
In order to OOV the new approach , the OOV OOV OOV have been OOV by the Member States will , for example , OOV OOV OOV for each directive .
<SPEAKER OOV LANGUAGE="DE " NAME=" OOV > .
( OOV ) Mr President , the OOV OOV is an important OOV of OOV OOV .
But it is a OOV OOV OOV .
OOV that is necessary is to OOV OOV with OOV European legal OOV .
That is certainly not enough for the OOV .
OOV also want quality OOV and OOV OOV so that they can find out whether a OOV is of OOV OOV and therefore also OOV their OOV .
<P> That is why OOV OOV is quite OOV , especially for safety OOV .
We OOV from the rail OOV in OOV that very serious OOV can OOV if the OOV only do their own OOV , without any OOV OOV .
OOV you think that in future we should place more OOV on OOV OOV in the European Union ?
<SPEAKER OOV LANGUAGE="SV" NAME=" OOV " > As I said OOV in my OOV OOV to the OOV Member , in the first place it is the Commission which is to ensure OOV with regard to the OOV of OOV OOV .
I would therefore like to OOV that , in the first OOV , the OOV Member OOV to the Commission for any further information OOV this matter .

At the same time , the Council of Europe has OOV that OOV OOV to be OOV OOV in OOV OOV OOV , OOV OOV OOV has OOV the OOV , the OOV and the general OOV of human rights by OOV and OOV on the European Union to OOV an OOV end to OOV and not in OOV , as OOV by the OOV for OOV 's OOV to the Union .
OOV the Council make OOV to the OOV Government to take measures to improve the situation in OOV OOV so that the OOV also end their OOV OOV ?
OOV it OOV OOV OOV 's call for an OOV end to OOV in the OOV of the OOV for OOV 's OOV to the European Union ?
<SPEAKER OOV LANGUAGE="SV" NAME=" OOV " > The OOV Government is , in all OOV , well aware of the Union 's OOV OOV that the situation in OOV OOV needs to be OOV and OOV OOV .
The Council OOV the fact that OOV has OOV a OOV of the OOV system and that the country is also OOV to OOV with the European Committee for the OOV of OOV .
OOV is one of the most OOV problems in OOV .
The Council has also given the issue priority in the OOV OOV agreement that OOV for the OOV of OOV , OOV by OOV to OOV legislation and taking all measures necessary to OOV the OOV against OOV and to ensure that the European Committee for the OOV of OOV is OOV .
This means OOV other things that the Council OOV OOV to make OOV progress in this area before the end of this year .
<P> OOV regard to the OOV of OOV OOV , the EU has OOV OOV a OOV system in OOV which OOV to international OOV .
OOV , in its OOV OOV in the OOV OOV agreement for OOV , the Council has OOV the OOV that conditions in OOV OOV be OOV to OOV to the OOV 's rules as OOV OOV OOV for the OOV of OOV .

OOV , the EU does not OOV OOV and OOV of OOV .
In their OOV with the EU , the OOV authorities have OOV all OOV of OOV and OOV .
The Council will , of course , continue to OOV the situation OOV .
<SPEAKER OOV OOV NAME=" OOV " > I too am one of the OOV who have OOV OOV of the Swedish Presidency on the question of human rights , because it is the presidency of a country which has OOV through its OOV that it has OOV OOV and that it is OOV by OOV when it OOV to human rights issues .
OOV I should like to say that the OOV 's OOV , but " OOV OOV me OOV OOV that the Council will continue to OOV OOV , that there may have been some OOV OOV , but OOV has given its OOV that OOV is OOV .
<P> I should like to ask the OOV if , in the OOV of this OOV which we have OOV OOV , with over OOV OOV OOV , with OOV , with people who may be in OOV because they OOV in their OOV OOV , with some OOV OOV OOV their OOV OOV , the Swedish Presidency will OOV take an initiative and OOV OOV and OOV from the OOV Government and , OOV , if the Swedish Presidency will OOV take an interest in OOV the OOV of OOV OOV , the OOV OOV the OOV OOV by this Parliament ; <SPEAKER OOV LANGUAGE="SV" NAME=" OOV " > OOV me just to OOV you that , OOV to the Council , the OOV agreement with OOV , which OOV OOV in OOV form , OOV an excellent opportunity for OOV OOV a OOV OOV ' on OOV when it OOV to OOV , the conditions in OOV and human rights in general .
The Council OOV OOV to use all OOV that OOV within the framework of this agreement to ensure that OOV in OOV OOV in a OOV which is OOV with the common OOV we OOV in the OOV
<SPEAKER OOV LANGUAGE="SV" NAME=" OOV " > A OOV OOV of the OOV in OOV OOV must be OOV as political OOV .
In OOV , people are also still being OOV on political OOV .
I was present OOV at a OOV on OOV OOV last year in OOV in OOV OOV where a OOV OOV was OOV with three years in OOV for OOV OOV about the OOV OOV against the OOV and OOV in OOV .
This was his only OOV ' , and for this he was to be OOV .
<P> OOV the Council OOV OOV to OOV OOV law and OOV specific OOV like this one , OOV people being OOV on political OOV ?
<SPEAKER OOV LANGUAGE="SV" NAME=" OOV " > In OOV fact , I can OOV Mr OOV 's question in the same way as I OOV the OOV question .
In OOV OOV an OOV country for OOV of the EU , which was done at the OOV OOV , the EU now has OOV new OOV of OOV following OOV in OOV and of OOV out every OOV from the OOV which should OOV to a OOV country .
I therefore see it as a very OOV OOV , also under the Swedish Presidency , to ensure that OOV in OOV OOV in such a way that we can OOV see the country OOV OOV to the European OOV in a more OOV way than we have OOV up to now .
<SPEAKER OOV NAME=" President " > <SPEAKER OOV NAME=" OOV OOV " > OOV No OOV by OOV ) : <P> OOV : OOV Council OOV The Swedish Presidency has OOV OOV to be OOV important to the work of the European Union .
<P> OOV many of the Council OOV to be OOV during the Swedish Presidency between OOV OOV and OOV OOV OOV will be OOV open to the public ?
<SPEAKER OOV LANGUAGE="SV" NAME=" OOV " > As has OOV also OOV from the OOV of the work programme by the OOV OOV a OOV OOV OOV , the Swedish Presidency OOV particular importance to the work of the Council ' s being open and OOV to European citizens and to OOV work ' s being open to public OOV .
The Swedish Presidency is OOV working towards making as many OOV as possible open within the OOV OOV which OOV .
<P> The Council 's OOV of OOV do not OOV OOV public Council OOV , which is something Mr OOV is also aware of .
However , public Council OOV can be OOV .
In OOV in OOV OOV the European Council OOV that , on a OOV basis , the OOV OOV Council and the OOV Council should OOV public OOV on the Council 's work programme .
This decision has now been OOV into the Council 's OOV of OOV .
OOV Council OOV are also OOV public OOV .
<P> OOV of the first OOV of the Swedish Presidency was therefore to OOV up a OOV of public OOV which were to OOV as OOV an area as possible of the Council 's work .
OOV , we have now OOV a OOV of the public OOV which are to be OOV during our presidency .
OOV such OOV will be OOV in what could be OOV as the important and OOV Council OOV OOV this OOV when OOV is to OOV a debate on its work programme .
OOV this , the OOV continue during the first OOV of the year up to the last public debate in the Council ( OOV ) which , in OOV , shall OOV the OOV of OOV against OOV OOV in the OOV .
OOV these measures , we have taken OOV in the work of the Council a OOV further .
There are OOV further OOV to be taken , but , Mr OOV , do not OOV the best to become the OOV of the good .
<SPEAKER OOV LANGUAGE="SV" NAME=" OOV " > OOV I shall not OOV the best to become the OOV of the good .
It is just that if we continue at the OOV of the Council of OOV it will be a OOV years before we have public OOV for real .
OOV OOV are actually not particularly OOV , if I may say so .
<P> I think that it should be a matter of course in a OOV society for the citizens to have the right of OOV to their most important OOV OOV , and in the European Union that is of course OOV the EU 's Council of OOV .
It is quite OOV a OOV OOV for democracy .
If it is now the case that the Council 's OOV of OOV OOV even the OOV and the OOV Council OOV where the Council is , so to OOV , OOV from being open , we OOV to change these OOV OOV of OOV OOV .
OOV there , therefore , be no such initiative from the Swedish Presidency , which is OOV the issues OOV to OOV so OOV - which is something I regard as OOV important and positive ?
<SPEAKER OOV LANGUAGE="SV" NAME=" OOV " > As Mr OOV is OOV aware , the Swedish Presidency OOV to use all the energy OOV to OOV to OOV the situation forward with regard to the question of OOV during OOV 's OOV of OOV the presidency .
We think that we are OOV OOV this with the OOV number of OOV that are open .
<P> We can OOV OOV with most national OOV .
OOV , for example , the Swedish Parliament .
The OOV work in the OOV in the Swedish Parliament is not public but OOV , and there are OOV for this .
There is a need to be able to agree OOV , but there is of course also a need for OOV OOV .
<P> I can OOV you , Mr OOV , that we will do all we can to OOV the situation forward , but OOV was not OOV in a OOV .
OOV a long OOV OOV with a small OOV .
<SPEAKER OOV NAME=" President " > <SPEAKER OOV NAME=" OOV OOV " > OOV No OOV by OOV ) : <P> OOV : OOV and human rights in OOV On a OOV of OOV OOV , the EU OOV it as its OOV to OOV democracy , human rights and the OOV of law .
OOV , a OOV of the OOV countries of OOV , OOV and OOV , is a country in which OOV of the OOV three OOV can be said to be OOV in an OOV OOV and there is clearly a OOV that the OOV may OOV to the OOV countries .
On OOV OOV 2000 in OOV , the OOV OOV of the EU , the Council of Europe and the OOV OOV a OOV OOV report on the OOV of democracy in OOV in OOV with the OOV OOV there .
The many people who have OOV OOV OOV OOV OOV OOV OOV , OOV OOV OOV OOV OOV , and the OOV OOV , OOV OOV .
<P> What OOV OOV does the Swedish Presidency OOV to take to OOV an OOV in democracy in OOV and what measures and OOV will be taken to OOV what has OOV to those who have OOV ?
<SPEAKER OOV LANGUAGE="SV" NAME=" OOV " > OOV , the OOV Member is OOV right in OOV that democracy , human rights and the principle of the OOV of law are not OOV in an OOV way in OOV .
The Council is well aware of the situation that has OOV for a long time in that country and is following the OOV very OOV .
The EU has OOV OOV to the authorities in OOV to respect international OOV in these extremely important areas .
At the same time , the European Union has made the most of every opportunity to OOV the development of a OOV civil society in OOV .
<P> The Swedish Presidency will , with great OOV , continue the efforts of the OOV OOV to OOV OOV in democracy in OOV .
The Council OOV that it is only through such OOV that the people of OOV can fully OOV their OOV over the future of the country .
OOV OOV in a new OOV , the people will get the OOV this year to take a OOV decision on what their future will OOV .
OOV the OOV OOV , the Council will OOV the OOV OOV every OOV to OOV that OOV have a real and OOV OOV of OOV .
The OOV s support of civil society , OOV organisations and OOV is an important OOV in OOV democracy .
<P> As a OOV of OOV , OOV and OOV , OOV will OOV OOV an OOV OOV
OOV , the Council is particularly OOV that , in the long OOV , OOV is OOV as a OOV and it is also OOV to ensure OOV in the region as a whole .
OOV , the Council has OOV OOV that the new OOV in the OOV countries will more than OOV with the OOV they may come up against .
The three countries mentioned have all OOV an important and OOV part through their OOV OOV relations with OOV .
OOV , they can OOV as OOV OOV to OOV when it OOV to OOV with regard to OOV and democracy .
<P> OOV these countries , the EU has OOV that a policy which OOV to OOV OOV would OOV against its own OOV .
OOV , the EU has OOV to OOV the OOV OOV with the authorities in OOV open and OOV them OOV to improve relations .
At the same time , the Union has OOV to OOV OOV for the country to OOV its OOV and to give the OOV OOV and OOV Group the OOV to OOV when it OOV to OOV OOV its OOV .
OOV the OOV OOV , the Union will once more present its point of view OOV to the authorities in OOV .
The Union will , of course , also take this opportunity to OOV the issue of people who have OOV OOV .
<SPEAKER OOV LANGUAGE="SV" NAME=" OOV " > It is a great OOV and OOV to be able to welcome here OOV OOV and the Swedish Presidency .
The Swedish OOV , the OOV of OOV and OOV , has OOV OOV before OOV in this House as it is OOV today .
OOV OOV OOV for your OOV .
<P> At this point I would like to take up some OOV issues .
They concern the political OOV which OOV in OOV between OOV and OOV and the OOV to which the Swedish Presidency is also OOV OOV on OOV , as part of a political OOV with OOV , to OOV the OOV OOV , and the OOV for its OOV in the international OOV , of being in a OOV with a country which can OOV be OOV as a democracy .
<P> You mentioned the OOV OOV in OOV in OOV .
But OOV OOV of the OOV in the OOV OOV OOV last OOV - I was there OOV as an OOV - were OOV .
I would also like to OOV the OOV of the EU taking action so as to OOV a OOV OOV .
We are , of course , OOV a OOV development , Mr OOV , in the OOV country of OOV .
We cannot OOV the OOV of what is OOV in OOV OOV , for we should OOV OOV that the OOV in OOV in fact has OOV on its OOV .
<SPEAKER OOV LANGUAGE="SV" NAME=" OOV " > I think that it is OOV right to see the development in OOV , as Mr OOV does , in OOV with the development in OOV and the development in OOV .
In the work programme OOV the cooperation between the EU and OOV which the presidency will present in the OOV OOV Council on OOV next OOV , there is much OOV of the need for OOV with OOV OOV the OOV in the OOV countries of OOV and OOV .
<P> We hope that we will OOV rather more OOV on the part of OOV , also with regard to OOV 's responsibility when it OOV to actually being able to OOV the development in OOV in a positive way .
We will then OOV this with the OOV efforts that I OOV OOV in my OOV OOV .
We think that it is important to OOV OOV , which is of course OOV to the OOV of Europe OOV than many people think if they have not OOV OOV at the OOV .
It is OOV OOV that we take every opportunity , on the part of the Union , to OOV about a development towards democracy in OOV .
<SPEAKER OOV NAME=" President " > <SPEAKER OOV NAME=" OOV OOV OOV > OOV No OOV by OOV ) : <P> OOV : OOV OOV without OOV or OOV In some countries women OOV OOV OOV and OOV , OOV human rights OOV which may OOV OOV and may OOV them their OOV .
In many OOV , this is a OOV of the OOV of OOV OOV or the OOV of OOV OOV and OOV .
The European Union OOV that it OOV to OOV women from such OOV OOV and OOV , but it has not yet OOV a way of OOV its OOV into political OOV and decisions OOV OOV for hope .
<P> OOV the Council be in favour of the OOV of measures OOV such OOV OOV women might be OOV OOV for OOV OOV and OOV , in political terms , in the European Union ?
<SPEAKER OOV LANGUAGE="SV" NAME=" OOV " > The Council 's OOV are well aware of the OOV of OOV and OOV which the OOV Member mentioned in OOV question .
OOV OOV , OOV OOV . the OOV for OOV , OOV and OOV on OOV , the situation in OOV OOV ' different countries of OOV is OOV OOV .
The OOV which are OOV here will be taken into account when the Member States deal with OOV OOV from those who have been OOV to such OOV of OOV .
It should , however , be OOV out that the OOV from the OOV which OOV has OOV out OOV that women who are OOV to OOV , OOV or OOV do not always give these OOV as the main OOV for their OOV OOV .
<P> As the OOV Member will OOV OOV , agreement was OOV at the OOV OOV in OOV to work towards OOV a common European OOV system OOV on a OOV and OOV OOV of the OOV OOV OOV that OOV is OOV back to be OOV to OOV , and that this system should OOV an OOV of the rules for the OOV and OOV of OOV OOV .
The Council has also agreed that this system should be OOV by measures for other OOV of OOV which provide a OOV OOV for those in need of such OOV .
<P> In OOV of last year , the Council was OOV in OOV a number of OOV OOV how OOV OOV should be OOV .
These OOV , which will form the basis for the proposal for a Council directive which the Commission will OOV in the OOV , OOV , OOV other things , OOV OOV that OOV Member States shall provide OOV health OOV to OOV OOV who have been OOV to OOV , OOV or other serious OOV of OOV .
The Council is now OOV the Commission 's proposal and , when it OOV , the Swedish Presidency OOV to OOV it as a priority issue .
<P> The Commission has also OOV its OOV to OOV a proposal OOV this year for rules for the OOV and OOV of OOV OOV and OOV OOV of OOV .
The question of how OOV OOV will be OOV in this OOV within the Union will OOV be the subject of OOV OOV .
<SPEAKER OOV LANGUAGE="ES " OOV OOV > I would like to ask the OOV of the Council whether he is in favour of women being OOV as OOV , for the OOV of OOV and OOV OOV in the European Union , without having to be OOV on a OOV or OOV .
Mr OOV of the Council , are you in favour of our OOV women OOV for a OOV or for OOV as people in their own right ?
I would OOV an OOV , one I hope will be OOV .
<SPEAKER OOV LANGUAGE="SV" NAME=" OOV " > OOV , I am in favour of such a OOV .
OOV OOV will of course be OOV OOV as an OOV .
We must also OOV that in many OOV OOV we are OOV with OOV OOV of different OOV .
In that case it may OOV that if part of a OOV has been OOV OOV , that will OOV the OOV of OOV for other OOV of the same OOV .
OOV we are , of course , OOV OOV from the principle of OOV OOV , but the OOV OOV to the OOV ' s question is : OOV .
<SPEAKER OOV NAME=" President " > <SPEAKER OOV NAME=" OOV OOV , which has been taken over by OOV OOV " > OOV No OOV by OOV ) : <P> OOV : OOV and the OOV of OOV OOV the Council , under the Swedish Presidency , OOV what level of priority it OOV to the situation in OOV and , in particular , will it make a clear OOV to OOV for the OOV of OOV OOV the health and OOV of OOV , women and OOV ?
<SPEAKER OOV LANGUAGE="SV" NAME=" OOV " > The OOV conditions of the OOV people , together with the OOV to achieve OOV security and OOV in the area , are the most important issues for the Council with regard to its policy towards OOV .
The Council is at present OOV the OOV open to the Union for making a contribution in the OOV and cultural OOV within the framework of OOV OOV OOV OOV from the OOV OOV Council .
This concerns in particular the resolution on the OOV for OOV programme .
But it is also important for the OOV Government to OOV in order for such a programme to be OOV .
<P> OOV course , the European Union will also in the future fully OOV the OOV OOV up by the OOV OOV Council against OOV .
OOV OOV from OOV OOV the opportunity to OOV the OOV , OOV the OOV Government OOV fully with the OOV OOV responsible for OOV in OOV .
In this OOV the Council also OOV and OOV the OOV of a working OOV within the OOV which will OOV up general OOV on OOV OOV OOV , on how they are to be better OOV and on how to OOV OOV human OOV .
<SPEAKER OOV NAME=" OOV " > I should like to thank the OOV for his OOV and also to wish OOV well for the Swedish Presidency .
<P> However , as a OOV to what he has already OOV , does the presidency feel that the OOV of the OOV Commission on OOV , which is OOV in OOV , should continue ?
As you know , this OOV also OOV with the question of OOV in the OOV of the OOV OOV . <P> We have already OOV the OOV OOV in OOV terms of the OOV and how they are being used by OOV OOV to OOV OOV Europe , as well as the OOV and the OOV , and to OOV his people back .
The OOV last OOV was that this was a OOV of good over OOV and that OOV OOV was good and the OOV of the world was OOV .
We are OOV into his OOV by OOV that people are OOV OOV to OOV , OOV and the other OOV of life .
<SPEAKER OOV LANGUAGE="SV" NAME=" OOV " > I think it is important to OOV that the OOV OOV for being able to OOV the OOV against OOV are that the OOV OOV OOV fully , in particular with the OOV 's OOV , with regard to the OOV of whether OOV still has OOV to OOV of OOV OOV .
This is also the OOV point for the Union when it OOV to OOV possible OOV to the OOV .
<P> As OOV the OOV OOV Committee OOV in OOV , which , as you know , has been working since the OOV OOV to OOV OOV OOV from the OOV , I think it is OOV to OOV for an OOV from the OOV of how this work is OOV before we in the Union take a OOV on whether or not this OOV will continue .
<P> OOV me to OOV that I believe it to be necessary for us in the Union , from a general point of view , to OOV to this OOV of principle on the OOV OOV itself and its OOV .
We have many OOV today of good political OOV for OOV OOV against a particular country , but we have OOV in OOV that these OOV actually OOV those we want them to OOV , OOV OOV . the OOV in these countries .
I think that , on the part of the Council , there is every reason , both as OOV OOV and in general , to continue the OOV on the form the OOV OOV should take .
<SPEAKER OOV NAME=" President " > As the OOV is not present , OOV No OOV OOV .

<SPEAKER OOV NAME=" President " > Mr OOV OOV , OOV to the OOV of OOV , a OOV OOV should have been OOV to OOV that you were taking over the question , as has been done in the case of Mr OOV .
I must OOV the OOV of OOV .
OOV OOV are OOV in this matter .
I am very OOV .
<P> OOV they deal with the same subject , OOV OOV OOV and OOV will be taken together .
<P> OOV No OOV by OOV OOV OOV ) : <P> OOV : OOV <P> OOV the Council give an OOV of the progress , or OOV , being made through their policy of OOV OOV ' with the military OOV in OOV ?
<P> OOV No OOV by OOV OOV OOV ) : <P> OOV : OOV and OOV <P> What is the Council ' s OOV to the OOV meeting of OOV OOV 2000 at which the OOV OOV OOV OOV that EU OOV with OOV must OOV all OOV OOV OOV OOV , including OOV ? <P> OOV the Council agree that OOV in OOV has actually OOV since the OOV of the EU common position in OOV 2000 and that it OOV OOV to OOV in OOV OOV OOV with OOV of that OOV ?
<SPEAKER OOV LANGUAGE="SV" NAME=" OOV " > The Council OOV the OOV Members ' concerns OOV the situation in OOV , including the new OOV which have been OOV against the OOV OOV for OOV during recent OOV .
The Council also OOV the recent OOV positive development OOV to the OOV made by the United OOV OOV 's OOV OOV for OOV , OOV OOV OOV OOV , and the OOV of a OOV for OOV between OOV OOV OOV OOV and the military OOV .
The Council has on a number of OOV OOV its concern in OOV and OOV and in the EU 's OOV OOV of OOV .
<P> The Council has also OOV OOV that human rights be OOV and specific measures taken towards democracy and national OOV .
The Council would OOV OOV its policy as OOV OOV , but rather as an OOV to achieve change by OOV OOV by means of OOV and through OOV .
As the OOV Member , OOV OOV , OOV us , the EU 's OOV OOV was OOV OOV in OOV of last year in the OOV of the Council 's concern over the OOV situation in OOV .
<P> At the same time , the Council agreed to OOV another OOV OOV to OOV .
It OOV now as if the OOV will be OOV OOV this OOV .
The Union has made it clear , including at the last OOV meeting between the EU and OOV in OOV in OOV of last year , that they are OOV the EU OOV to be given the same OOV to OOV all the parties involved , whether they are from the Government , the OOV OOV for OOV or OOV OOV .
<P> The OOV meeting in OOV , which OOV OOV in , OOV an appropriate opportunity not only to OOV the OOV which OOV the EU and OOV but also to OOV the Union 's concern OOV the situation in OOV OOV to the OOV OOV OOV .
The Council also OOV the fact that , in the OOV OOV which was agreed on in OOV , both the EU and OOV OOV to support the United OOV OOV 's OOV OOV for OOV , OOV OOV OOV OOV , in his efforts to OOV about positive change in OOV .
<SPEAKER OOV NAME=" OOV , OOV " > Mr President , may I also welcome the OOV .
I OOV the OOV but I do have to ask , with the OOV that of course OOV OOV OOV OOV has been under OOV OOV OOV now for about OOV OOV : how can you OOV that a OOV is able to OOV out a OOV OOV or OOV with OOV OOV ?
That is my first question .
OOV , should not OOV and the OOV actually be OOV OOV OOV before we are OOV to OOV the OOV in this way ?
<P> You say that the OOV will have OOV to areas and to as many OOV as it OOV .
OOV you OOV conditions on this OOV OOV , which would OOV that they are OOV OOV to give that OOV of OOV ?
<P> Finally , just one last OOV OOV : in OOV OOV OOV OOV OOV did have some OOV with the OOV , as they were OOV then , and they said all the time that OOV was being far too OOV , this OOV is OOV to deal with because OOV OOV OOV us to respect the results of the OOV OOV .
I OOV whether you are concerned that they might be still OOV OOV with the European Union and the international OOV and they will again say : OOV , this OOV is OOV . "
<SPEAKER OOV LANGUAGE="SV" NAME=" OOV " > OOV , OOV me say that I OOV fully OOV the concern OOV by Mrs OOV OOV the situation in OOV .
The Council has the same OOV opinion as that OOV by Mrs OOV in OOV question , OOV that it is OOV that we must OOV OOV conditions on OOV with regard to human rights .
I would like to OOV you that the European Union is OOV in OOV areas with regard to the OOV for human rights in that country .
The Union is OOV within the OOV , in the OOV OOV Rights Commission and in the OOV OOV OOV .
A OOV for the OOV I have OOV and those which we hope to be able to make at the OOV OOV with the OOV is of course that we OOV full OOV to all OOV parties in OOV .
This OOV without OOV , but OOV we can now see that the situation in OOV is also OOV more OOV for other OOV .
There are OOV OOV OOV going on now between OOV and OOV , which could also OOV the situation within OOV .
<P> So , OOV me to OOV you that the Council fully OOV Mrs OOV 's concern with regard to the situation .
This does not in any way OOV that we should OOV to the OOV of the OOV Government .
We are making OOV OOV for OOV OOV , with regard to both the OOV and OOV OOV .
The OOV must not , of course , be OOV in this OOV .
<SPEAKER OOV NAME=" OOV " > OOV you for that very OOV OOV .
As you know , the next OOV meeting between the EU and the OOV countries is OOV to take place in Europe .
At the OOV we have a OOV against OOV into any of the EU Member States by any OOV of the military OOV in OOV and their OOV .
They will , therefore , not be able to take part in that meeting .
<P> OOV countries are OOV the Union to OOV that OOV .
OOV I have your OOV that you will not give in to such OOV ?
<SPEAKER OOV LANGUAGE="SV" NAME=" OOV " > The Council does not give in to OOV .
The Council has still not made a decision OOV OOV OOV in the OOV OOV meeting between the EU and OOV which Mr OOV OOV to .
The Council will OOV make a decision on the basis of the OOV OOV OOV by the Union OOV relations with OOV .
I can OOV Mr OOV that we OOV have OOV the same opinion OOV what is necessary for the Council to be able to OOV OOV OOV in this OOV meeting .
<SPEAKER OOV NAME=" President " > <SPEAKER OOV NAME=" OOV the OOV OOV " > OOV No OOV by OOV ) : <P> OOV : OOV and Swedish Presidency OOV the Council , under the Swedish Presidency , OOV what level of importance it OOV to the fisheries sector having regard , in this OOV , to the extremely difficult situation being OOV at present by OOV in OOV and other EU countries and will it OOV its OOV with regard to the next development programme for the fishing OOV for the OOV OOV - OOV ? <SPEAKER OOV LANGUAGE="SV" NAME=" OOV " > It is not clear from the OOV Member ' s question whether it is OOV at the Council or the Swedish Presidency .
OOV , I am OOV to be able to take the opportunity , as also OOV by the OOV Member , OOV to OOV a few OOV with regard to the future policy for the Community 's fishing OOV .
<P> OOV , OOV me to say that the presidency OOV great importance to the common fisheries policy and that we are fully aware of the difficult situation OOV by the fishing industry after the OOV OOV in OOV OOV . at the Council 's meeting in OOV of last year .
However , the OOV were necessary in the OOV of the situation OOV OOV OOV , particularly with regard to OOV and OOV , and which also OOV a number of other OOV .
<P> As the Council OOV it , the OOV OOV for this situation in the long OOV is to OOV a OOV OOV between the fishing OOV and the available resources in order to OOV a OOV and OOV OOV of OOV OOV resources and to OOV the future OOV of the OOV .
<P> The presidency therefore OOV to OOV a general debate in the Council on the OOV to the development programmes which have been taking place over OOV years once the OOV of these development programmes has been OOV on OOV OOV OOV .
The Commission will OOV its proposals in the OOV future .
We are well aware that a OOV has not been OOV by the present programmes and that they have been OOV in certain OOV .
<P> In OOV to the OOV problems which were OOV mentioned in the question , the presidency 's OOV also OOV OOV work on the Commission 's OOV OOV on the future of the common fisheries policy and OOV up a proposal from the presidency on fishing and the environment , OOV OOV . the OOV of environmental issues and the principle of OOV development in the common fisheries policy .
This is part of the OOV process , and the Council is OOV to present such a OOV at the meeting of the European Council in OOV .
<P> The presidency does not consider there to be much OOV for taking support measures to the OOV of an OOV Member State .
OOV , the common fisheries policy OOV to be OOV for the OOV of the fishing sector OOV the Union .
<P> It has OOV not OOV the attention of the OOV Member that the OOV OOV in fishing OOV will be OOV by OOV for the OOV of the OOV OOV .
In this OOV we have OOV the European Parliament to OOV by OOV its opinion in OOV on the proposal for a OOV plan for OOV in the OOV OOV , and these measures can come into OOV as OOV as OOV OOV OOV .
We OOV the work the European Parliament has done in this regard but we are still not OOV that this will actually become OOV .
I hope , therefore , that Parliament is OOV to OOV with the Council on this point .
<SPEAKER OOV NAME=" OOV " > OOV you for your OOV and also for OOV us a few more OOV .
I am OOV that you have been so OOV as to OOV the OOV as OOV , because that is all they can be OOV as .
However , I also OOV that it is necessary to have OOV in order to ensure that we have OOV resources for this OOV and , indeed , future OOV .
<P> I OOV to your OOV on OOV OOV .
I would ask you to OOV us that you will make every OOV to ensure that when the OOV OOV are being OOV it is not only the OOV but also the OOV and the OOV who will be involved in these OOV .
OOV the OOV I know are OOV and they OOV that it is necessary to have OOV areas to OOV the OOV OOV .
<P> In OOV , can you give us an OOV that you will make an OOV to have the OOV involved in any OOV OOV ?
<SPEAKER OOV LANGUAGE="SV" NAME=" OOV " > I fully agree with the OOV Member ' s view .
OOV we OOV such important issues , it is important that all parties concerned are able to take part in the OOV in an appropriate way .
I think that it is quite OOV that this OOV of OOV should have a OOV basis , but all those involved , including OOV of the OOV , should of course have the opportunity to OOV in it .
I can therefore OOV you that , as far as the presidency is concerned , we will do all we can to ensure that there is a OOV OOV with as many of those involved with these important issues as possible .
<SPEAKER OOV NAME=" OOV " > I should just like to ask the OOV if there will be OOV available because of the OOV and what OOV this will have on the OOV of OOV ?
OOV there any proposals for OOV to OOV ?
<SPEAKER OOV LANGUAGE="SV" NAME=" OOV " > The question OOV by the OOV Member is , of course , very important , particularly for the OOV who are OOV .
However , I am OOV that the question has been OOV to the OOV OOV , OOV OOV . the OOV of the Council .
This is , as we see it , a question which should OOV be OOV to the Commission , which is responsible for this area .
<SPEAKER OOV NAME=" President " > OOV you very much , Mr OOV , for having done more than your OOV in this first OOV OOV .
<P> OOV the time OOV to OOV to the Council has OOV , OOV OOV OOV to OOV will be OOV in OOV .
<P> OOV OOV OOV and OOV will not be taken since their subject is OOV in the OOV for the current OOV .
<P> That OOV OOV to the Council .
<P> ( The OOV was OOV at OOV OOV and OOV at OOV OOV ) OOV OOV OOV OOV <SPEAKER OOV NAME=" President " > The next OOV is the report ( OOV ) by Mr OOV , on behalf of the Committee on OOV OOV , OOV and OOV , on the proposal for a European Parliament and Council OOV OOV Council OOV ( OOV ) No OOV on the OOV of OOV OOV and OOV OOV in the field of civil OOV .
<SPEAKER OOV NAME=" OOV " > .
Mr President , I have been given a very OOV OOV OOV on my report here in OOV of this OOV OOV this OOV - I OOV that is because many people find this report quite OOV and OOV .
<P> OOV OOV up the second OOV OOV in OOV , the Council and the Commission agreed that Community OOV transport policy had to OOV the OOV of the OOV framework OOV to civil OOV .
OOV , Council OOV OOV was OOV in which the OOV OOV , OOV as OOV OOV OOV , OOV by the OOV , were given the OOV of law within the Community .
<P> It is against this OOV that the OOV OOV OOV , OOV as OOV , agreed by the OOV in OOV , are now being OOV into European Union law .
This in itself has OOV to be a difficult OOV .
But the Community has OOV itself to OOV OOV safety OOV for the OOV of OOV .
In this regard , the OOV OOV OOV OOV a good basis from which we can work , with OOV OOV , in order to OOV the appropriate OOV .
<P> However , there are areas in which Parliament needs to OOV .
OOV , in regard to OOV OOV .
OOV should have the responsibility for OOV , but this should be done on a OOV basis , with a OOV , OOV , OOV OOV system which would be OOV by all Member States .
<P> There is no OOV in my OOV that in most OOV the OOV are best OOV to OOV OOV .
But this should not OOV other OOV organisations from having the OOV to do OOV , OOV , of course , that all OOV is OOV by the OOV OOV OOV OOV .
In OOV , the OOV OOV directive should now be OOV into this OOV .
<P> OOV , the difficult issue of OOV time OOV was not OOV by the Commission .
The OOV part , OOV as OOV OOV , is OOV .
This is OOV , because you cannot have a directive which OOV to have safety as a major part of it OOV out the issue of OOV time for OOV OOV .
In this area , the social OOV have been OOV to OOV an agreement for OOV years .
OOV years and no agreement must be a OOV by any OOV you wish to OOV .
<P> However , the Committee on OOV OOV , OOV and OOV OOV that the best people to deal with this problem are indeed the trade OOV and the OOV OOV and , in a OOV of OOV , have agreed to give all OOV OOV OOV OOV OOV to OOV an agreement that will form the OOV of a new OOV OOV . <P> However , should they OOV in their OOV then , at the second OOV OOV , Parliament , through the Committee on OOV OOV , OOV and OOV , will OOV and OOV in this area .
I am OOV that the OOV social OOV will OOV an agreement .
I am OOV to them for their current efforts .
<P> OOV have been OOV that also look at the problem of OOV OOV .
OOV , OOV at present do not OOV OOV OOV OOV OOV , which has OOV to OOV OOV more and more OOV into OOV OOV .
OOV No OOV OOV this problem , which was OOV to me by the OOV OOV themselves and even some OOV .
<P> I find it OOV OOV that OOV in Parliament will vote against this OOV .
This is a safety issue , and as their rapporteur I would ask them to OOV OOV their opinion .
This OOV is OOV OOV to all OOV and OOV OOV and it in no way OOV OOV having OOV OOV .
What it does is OOV the OOV OOV OOV which has OOV to OOV being OOV from OOV OOV out of OOV OOV ; to OOV having OOV OOV in case of OOV OOV OOV and , which I know from my own OOV , to OOV OOV being used to OOV OOV .
<P> OOV I OOV that OOV are OOV the OOV OOV for OOV OOV OOV , I would hope their OOV of responsibility would OOV them to OOV that a problem OOV , that this problem OOV safety and that OOV No OOV should be OOV .
<P> I believe that the report before us is OOV OOV .
However , in OOV , I feel I must OOV the OOV I made OOV that we need an agreement on OOV time OOV before OOV OOV from our social OOV .
If they can OOV that agreement for us , then I believe we will have a OOV that we can OOV be OOV of .
I have to say that if they OOV in their OOV , I am OOV Parliament will feel OOV to OOV on their behalf .
<SPEAKER OOV LANGUAGE="DE " NAME=" OOV " > Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , Mr OOV , we have to agree with much of what you said .
It is OOV that it OOV clear in OOV with the OOV OOV that the European Community must not only ensure OOV OOV but must also ensure safety in OOV .
The present OOV of the OOV OOV to do that and I think it is right for the European OOV to clearly OOV their responsibility .
That means that if we are responsible for OOV OOV safety in Europe , we must also take the appropriate action .
<P> But at the same time we must also make it clear that Parliament and political OOV such as the Commission and the Council should not OOV the vote of OOV .
So I very much welcome the fact that we OOV a very OOV debate in committee and OOV really OOV to OOV into the OOV of the OOV rules or , so to OOV , to put political OOV OOV the OOV of the OOV .
<P> You quite OOV also OOV out , and I think that is quite clear , that we need rules on OOV time , and I OOV am OOV that in OOV of this long process the social OOV have still not OOV to put rules together .
That is why I also think it is right for us as Parliament to make it clear once again that we OOV the social OOV OOV and OOV ' OOV to OOV their OOV .
We are OOV to OOV this into the OOV too , at second OOV .
On the other hand , we are OOV OOV to put our own rules in place if the social OOV do not OOV their OOV .
For one OOV is quite clear : safety in OOV must take priority .
<P> OOV safety in OOV cannot be OOV just by having rules , especially not OOV rules .
That is why I also say quite OOV : however much we can agree with OOV OOV of the report , we do not consider it appropriate for Parliament to OOV its own OOV OOV into this OOV in certain areas under the OOV , for OOV , of OOV OOV OOV OOV OOV " or OOV of OOV , OOV OOV . how long OOV has already OOV as a OOV OOV OOV .
So OOV we will not be able to vote for your OOV OOV OOV and OOV , which concern such proposals .
<P> I was OOV OOV to see how OOV the Committee on OOV OOV , OOV and OOV OOV and OOV the question of hand OOV .
In my view that is not an issue for a OOV to OOV and I can only say to Mr OOV and my other OOV : OOV the OOV OOV that ; it is not the OOV of Members .
<SPEAKER OOV OOV " NAME=" OOV " > Mr President , Mr OOV , Commissioner , I OOV for a OOV , just after OOV the OOV - and in fact things were OOV a OOV that way - that we would start with a debate on OOV OOV , which will OOV OOV to be an extremely OOV debate in OOV s House of OOV this OOV .
We are also going to be OOV OOV OOV here .
<P> We OOV one particular OOV OOV at any OOV , that of the OOV time of OOV , and we also put OOV to the Commissioner on the subject at an OOV OOV .
I am OOV that a situation has OOV in the OOV in which the OOV have had it OOV out to them once again that they still have the OOV to OOV into OOV or OOV OOV .
If they do not do so then , as OOV have already said , this will OOV OOV OOV the Commission to OOV up legislation in this area which will at least OOV OOV from OOV as a result of OOV OOV too long at the OOV .
<P> OOV from which we once OOV OOV now OOV too long , and these negotiations could OOV this up , and OOV in time we will OOV an even better OOV of what all the important OOV might be .
<P> OOV OOV that we did not OOV during the OOV , because it only OOV into OOV OOV on , is the one that we have also OOV an OOV on , OOV that of long OOV OOV .
It is OOV OOV OOV - and OOV to this OOV are now being made not only in OOV , but also in OOV , OOV OOV OOV - that long OOV OOV can OOV people to OOV OOV .
We cannot yet be OOV certain of this , OOV do we have all the OOV OOV in our OOV yet , but we OOV the OOV of the situation all the same , and OOV if it would not be OOV to OOV the Commission - OOV an OOV in this case , OOV we will do so OOV other means - to come up with some OOV on this OOV .
<P> Finally , and this is something we have given no OOV to OOV , there is the fact that some OOV OOV with OOV OOV are OOV to OOV at a OOV OOV , which also OOV OOV of OOV .
We will OOV this issue at a OOV OOV .
<SPEAKER OOV OOV " NAME=" OOV > Mr President , Mr OOV 's report is OOV excellent , and I am OOV to say so for I consider OOV to be one of the few people who are OOV with the OOV as well as the political OOV of the sector , having OOV OOV OOV OOV OOV OOV OOV as a OOV of a OOV OOV before OOV OOV to OOV .
<P> I would point out that safety is the priority in OOV transport .
OOV can be OOV to be OOV on two OOV : the OOV OOV , such as the resources , OOV , OOV , OOV aid , OOV OOV OOV and so on and so OOV , and then the human OOV , which is extremely important and , although not the OOV OOV , has been OOV to be a OOV OOV in an extremely high OOV of OOV OOV .
The human OOV is , of course , extremely OOV and , for OOV 's OOV , can be OOV into two main OOV .
OOV of these is OOV , and in this area all the appropriate OOV and OOV must be OOV out .
I can say from my own OOV that OOV OOV are OOV OOV for , OOV from OOV OOV , there are no OOV OOV .
As a general OOV , OOV OOV do not OOV : they are all OOV in peace OOV .
The other OOV is OOV .
<P> The problems here are OOV : on the one hand , there is the need to make both OOV and OOV OOV as much as possible , and on the other , there is the need to OOV OOV human OOV , especially , OOV their OOV and OOV OOV .
OOV , the OOV of OOV OOV and so on clearly OOV OOV safety as well as the OOV health of the OOV of the OOV and OOV OOV .
<P> OOV , then , is the OOV in the OOV , for it OOV OOV the OOV OOV of the resources - OOV OOV OOV , OOV OOV , OOV of OOV , OOV OOV OOV . but it is OOV OOV in any OOV on the OOV of the OOV .
I am not OOV as a trade OOV here but OOV as a OOV of OOV transport who would OOV like to have a OOV - although I OOV that a OOV % OOV is OOV - which is as high as possible and OOV OOV OOV of the human OOV which is OOV to have serious or even OOV OOV .
<P> OOV OOV to be taken into OOV is OOV .
If there are no OOV rules , some of the OOV who OOV their OOV will be able to OOV their costs and therefore OOV more OOV OOV , OOV what OOV to be OOV OOV in a sector which is now OOV OOV OOV .
However , we could even go so far as to OOV of OOV or OOV OOV if this OOV were not taken into account , and I OOV at the fact that OOV the Union as a whole OOV Parliament , OOV , has OOV in OOV the matter OOV .
Parliament should feel OOV OOV at not having OOV to OOV a clear opinion or OOV an OOV OOV of all OOV of the issue .
<SPEAKER OOV LANGUAGE="DE " NAME=" OOV > Mr President , OOV of the Commission , I consider this OOV extremely important and after all the European Parliament has been OOV for an OOV in OOV safety since OOV .
That means we must also OOV the OOV and OOV OOV of the OOV OOV as of the OOV OOV .
I agree with the OOV OOV that we should give the OOV and the OOV a last OOV to OOV this issue between themselves , working OOV and OOV .
<P> OOV course we have agreed that they must OOV an agreement by OOV next year .
Madam OOV , OOV OOV your services that if they have not done so by the end of OOV we will no OOV OOV the OOV that has been OOV for OOV years , OOV with the Commission OOV for the parties to OOV agreement .
But they have not OOV agreement .
The Commission OOV very OOV and did not make any proposals of its own .
OOV the parties agree by OOV , or we OOV the Commission to put forward a proposal that we can OOV in the second OOV .
For it is OOV not to OOV a question that is OOV to OOV safety , OOV whether the OOV , the OOV , have had enough OOV to be able to OOV out their OOV .
These issues must be OOV .
<P> OOV me OOV a second point that OOV my attention at the OOV Council meeting .
If we OOV a position at first OOV , in fact at Parliament 's OOV vote OOV , then I OOV as I am OOV my OOV will also do on the Council OOV a common position .
It can OOV OOV OOV , OOV the two parties have OOV agreement .
But in the interests of OOV safety in Europe we cannot OOV no decisions being taken on OOV OOV the OOV OOV of the OOV conflict .
The Commission and Parliament should OOV see to that .
<P> <SPEAKER OOV NAME=" OOV " > Mr President , as mentioned in OOV , the Council and the Commission agreed that they had to OOV the OOV of the OOV framework OOV to civil OOV in order to OOV a high level of safety and to ensure OOV OOV in the OOV market .
OOV , the Community adopted Council OOV OOV .
<P> This OOV OOV a number of OOV OOV - OOV - OOV by the OOV OOV OOV .
It was not the OOV of this OOV to OOV a debate on the OOV of OOV : the OOV was to ensure OOV .
In OOV , it should be OOV that OOV has been OOV on a national basis and is OOV to European countries OOV the OOV
OOV OOV must be OOV to a OOV as there cannot be two different OOV of OOV OOV in OOV OOV Europe .
<P> The Commission 's OOV proposal OOV OOV areas which were OOV to be OOV in EU law : OOV , OOV , OOV and OOV OOV OOV .
OOV , the debate so far has OOV on OOV OOV and OOV time OOV for OOV OOV .
<P> On the first point - OOV OOV - the amendments are OOV and cannot OOV to OOV OOV .
OOV OOV is already in place , which does not OOV on OOV hand OOV which cannot be OOV OOV - I can OOV for that as a OOV OOV OOV for OOV years .
<P> On my second point - OOV time OOV , which are already OOV OOV and agreed through national OOV - civil OOV is now OOV in working time OOV .
<P> OOV of the decision taken on OOV OOV , this issue would have to be OOV back to national OOV for further OOV .
It is not for Parliament to OOV on OOV time OOV .
<P> Finally , I believe that in future safety and OOV OOV reports such as this should be subject to a OOV OOV in order to process necessary OOV more OOV .
<SPEAKER OOV LANGUAGE="DE " NAME=" OOV " > Mr President , Commissioner , there are some things that are not quite as we would wish them to be in European OOV .
OOV year , in particular , OOV us OOV that it is high time to find more common European OOV to ensure that OOV in European OOV OOV OOV OOV again , not to OOV of the great OOV of OOV OOV OOV the OOV OOV up by OOV OOV .
<P> But first and OOV , OOV must be OOV .
We all want OOV to OOV OOV , to see further OOV here in the OOV the rapporteur , Mr OOV , to OOV we OOV OOV for an excellent report .
<P> There are , however , different OOV on how to achieve greater safety .
I and OOV I am not OOV in my view would hope that we OOV the OOV OOV of OOV the safety OOV , especially in regard to OOV OOV and the OOV OOV on OOV OOV , to the European OOV OOV OOV .
OOV it should be enough for the European OOV to set out the OOV , rather than OOV OOV down in too much OOV .
OOV , this position did not OOV OOV OOV support in committee .
As a result the OOV we will be OOV on OOV OOV some rather too OOV OOV , for OOV on the OOV of OOV course OOV and so OOV .
OOV less would be more in this case .
<P> OOV that as it may , Europe still has a great deal to do on the question of OOV .
As we OOV in OOV on a very general basis , here too on a more specific basis we could OOV for OOV national OOV and a more European approach .
The OOV report is a good OOV OOV this road .
OOV us take that OOV OOV and then OOV it further in a OOV OOV OOV .
<SPEAKER OOV LANGUAGE="ES " NAME=" OOV OOV OOV OOV OOV " > Mr President , OOV of the Commission , in the OOV , Parliament has OOV OOV its OOV to the OOV of safety OOV at the OOV possible level for the Union .
OOV it must continue to do so , and to ensure , as a matter of OOV , that this is clearly OOV to the European citizens , who every year continue to OOV the problems of the European area .
<P> We all agree that the OOV is to OOV do OOV with national OOV in order to OOV at a set of common safety OOV at the OOV possible level .
OOV safety cannot be OOV to European Union OOV , and it is important for European citizens who OOV or OOV OOV OOV to be OOV that OOV from third countries OOV all the necessary safety OOV .
The Union must therefore have OOV OOV to ensure that , in OOV with international OOV , third country OOV OOV at our OOV OOV with international safety OOV .
This means common OOV OOV and OOV and OOV OOV and support .
<P> It is therefore OOV that safety in this sector should become a matter for international cooperation within the framework of the different OOV for OOV OOV and support for OOV in third countries .
<P> Mr President , I will end by OOV out the need to OOV the Commission in its work in this very OOV field and the priority which must be given to OOV the European OOV OOV OOV , as well as the need for OOV OOV , which we are OOV OOV , on issues OOV to OOV OOV for OOV .
<SPEAKER OOV LANGUAGE="ES " NAME=" OOV OOV > Mr President , I would OOV like to thank Mr OOV for his OOV work as rapporteur on this proposal .
I believe that his work has OOV a OOV OOV to this Parliament ' s OOV of a very OOV and OOV proposal and it is of course no OOV OOV to OOV it into a OOV which is OOV to the OOV OOV .
In this respect I believe that he has been very OOV .
<P> OOV said that , the OOV we are OOV to the OOV OOV in OOV has OOV OOV : OOV , it OOV to OOV forward with the OOV of the OOV system in the field of safety in civil OOV by OOV it to the OOV of the OOV OOV for OOV ; OOV , it OOV to OOV OOV which will OOV the Community to OOV the OOV and OOV which the Member States are OOV to OOV from time to time as a result of OOV needs .
<P> OOV regard to OOV OOV , the report OOV OOV with two OOV .
In OOV with OOV OOV , which OOV down the OOV , the Commission ' s proposal does not OOV any OOV on OOV and OOV OOV or on OOV OOV .
This is a very OOV issue and the OOV is that no agreement has been OOV in this regard within the OOV .
<P> OOV course , the Commission OOV that the OOV OOV the OOV and the OOV will be OOV , and Mr OOV has OOV them to OOV a OOV agreement on safety systems OOV to OOV and OOV OOV and OOV OOV .
If they are not OOV of OOV OOV by OOV , we will then have to consider whether or not we should OOV .
<P> In any OOV , of the OOV amendments , the Commission OOV the OOV of OOV OOV OOV , OOV and OOV , but with a different OOV .
<P> OOV regard to OOV No OOV , the Commission OOV Parliament ' s OOV to OOV the safety of OOV and OOV OOV and OOV OOV , but OOV that OOV with this OOV not only be OOV by means of the specific proposal that we are OOV today .
There are other OOV , such as OOV the OOV after the OOV of the present proposal .
I would like to OOV that any proposal OOV by the Commission in the future will have to OOV the high level of safety that we all wish to see .
OOV , if the Commission OOV use of the OOV agreement between the OOV , to which I have just OOV , to OOV a proposal , it would OOV the agreement where necessary in order to achieve the necessary high level of safety .
OOV this OOV , I OOV , the Commission OOV the OOV of OOV No OOV . <P> OOV amendments have also been adopted on the OOV OOV to OOV OOV .
OOV this proposal OOV with the OOV OOV of OOV OOV , the OOV and OOV OOV OOV are the subject of a OOV and OOV Commission proposal .
We must take OOV to ensure that the two OOV are in agreement and OOV with one another .
<P> OOV OOV OOV and OOV can be OOV without OOV , but the OOV of OOV OOV OOV , OOV , OOV and OOV will have to be OOV , as well as OOV OOV OOV , OOV and OOV , which we now OOV only in principle , and their OOV will also have to be OOV .
<P> Finally , the amendments on OOV OOV , OOV OOV OOV OOV , OOV and OOV , are OOV , although the OOV OOV of OOV No OOV will OOV the OOV to the problem in question as OOV by the Council .
<P> In OOV to the OOV for the OOV of OOV OOV and OOV , the Commission does not OOV OOV OOV OOV , OOV and OOV .
The Commission is already under OOV OOV to OOV out the OOV OOV down in the amendments .
<P> OOV , OOV No OOV must be OOV , since OOV of the OOV is OOV once the European OOV OOV OOV has been OOV .
<P> OOV , with regard to OOV No OOV , the two issues it OOV are concerned more with the health of OOV than the OOV safety of OOV .
As was mentioned in the OOV on the OOV of OOV OOV , the Commission OOV to OOV OOV of OOV to OOV the OOV to OOV ' health , including those OOV from OOV OOV , with the OOV of OOV what these OOV are and OOV the necessary measures .
<P> OOV regard to the specific issue of OOV OOV - which has been OOV by some of you - the Commission has OOV to the OOV to OOV that they provide OOV with information on the OOV , on OOV for OOV and on what they can do to OOV those OOV , OOV in OOV to the problem of OOV and in OOV to health problems in general .
The Commission OOV that such information would be a very OOV OOV and that it would be appropriate in terms of OOV OOV ' rights .
<SPEAKER OOV NAME=" President " > OOV you , Commissioner .
<P> The debate is OOV .
<P> The vote will take place OOV at OOV OOV .
OOV OOV OOV in road safety <SPEAKER OOV NAME=" President " > The next OOV is the report ( OOV ) by Mrs OOV OOV , on behalf of the Committee on OOV OOV , OOV and OOV , on the proposal for a European Parliament resolution on the OOV from the Commission to the Council , the European Parliament , the OOV and OOV Committee and the Committee of the OOV : OOV in EU OOV OOV - OOV OOV and OOV of OOV .
<SPEAKER OOV LANGUAGE="SV" NAME=" OOV OOV " > , rapporteur .
( OOV ) Mr President , I would like to start by OOV all my OOV Members in Parliament and in the Committee for the support they have given me in my work on this report .
<P> OOV on our OOV is something which concerns us all , whether we OOV are OOV or whether OOV in our OOV or a OOV has been OOV or OOV .
OOV by road is the most common and the OOV OOV means of OOV and of OOV OOV and OOV , but also the most OOV .
OOV year , over OOV people are OOV on our European OOV .
This means more than OOV people a OOV and over OOV people this very OOV .
OOV OOV OOV are the most common OOV of OOV of OOV and young OOV - indeed , of all OOV under the OOV of OOV - in the EU today .
OOV of people are also OOV OOV each year , and many will end up OOV for life .
This is a matter of great human OOV and of OOV social costs .
<P> We would OOV OOV such OOV OOV in OOV or on the OOV , where our approach to safety is OOV different .
So , if we are to OOV the number of OOV on the OOV , we must OOV the same OOV with regard to OOV , since this also OOV a OOV OOV system which must OOV OOV of human OOV .
<P> The OOV in the OOV should be that OOV should be OOV or OOV OOV .
OOV OOV this OOV , we must take a OOV view in which the OOV responsibility OOV with those who OOV the OOV and the OOV infrastructure .
It is the responsibility of OOV to OOV the rules and OOV which have been OOV down .
<P> The Commission ' s OOV OOV a OOV of OOV for measures for the OOV OOV of the OOV .
I agree with the Commission OOV the OOV of OOV of these measures such as the aid to OOV , information OOV , legislation on OOV OOV for OOV OOV , and - especially - legislation on OOV OOV OOV .
<P> In my report , I OOV on to OOV on the OOV OOV of the OOV , which would have to OOV a OOV OOV - OOV us say , the OOV OOV - to OOV a more OOV OOV to be adopted .
But if the Commission is really serious about its OOV to OOV the number of OOV , we will first of all have to give OOV priority to the whole question of road safety , because this matter OOV OOV measures <P> OOV of all , a OOV OOV for OOV OOV on the OOV must , over the next OOV , OOV OOV OOV OOV for OOV the number of OOV .
The Committee OOV those OOV which were already OOV by Parliament three years OOV .
But OOV at EU level are not OOV OOV for the Member States where , as we all know , a OOV part of the work is done .
OOV Member State must therefore OOV its own OOV programmes ( which not all Member States have at present ) , including OOV for OOV the national OOV .
These can of course OOV between the various countries , OOV on OOV and OOV .
However , after that , the Commission should OOV up how the Member States OOV with their OOV and should take part in the OOV of OOV and best OOV .
We also need European legislation in certain important areas .
OOV OOV OOV OOV OOV people on the OOV each year .
OOV , the OOV OOV that more and more young people are OOV with OOV in their OOV .
OOV OOV OOV OOV OOV could be OOV by OOV a directive with a OOV OOV OOV OOV of OOV OOV .
OOV , the Commission has OOV its OOV proposal for a directive - one which was OOV by Parliament in OOV and which the Committee OOV even now .
OOV to the Commission , OOV is a question that OOV under the principle of OOV .
But how can that be ?
OOV it cannot be any less OOV to OOV with OOV in the OOV in OOV OOV , OOV , OOV and OOV , where an OOV OOV OOV OOV , than it is in the OOV of Europe .
We have OOV in the EU when it OOV to issues OOV road OOV safety .
In my opinion , we should use these OOV OOV in those areas where they have a real OOV , and they do have a real OOV where OOV and OOV are concerned .
I OOV the Council and the Swedish Presidency to take the initiative in this matter .
<P> I cannot OOV how we can OOV OOV OOV as European OOV if we , on the one hand , say that OOV safety is important but , on the other hand , are not OOV to take important decisions .
I OOV that the Commission has today OOV a OOV for a OOV of OOV OOV , but I must say that it is OOV that it should be OOV today , just when Parliament is about to OOV the issue and before Parliament has OOV .
The Commission should have OOV for Parliament to have OOV its OOV .
<P> In OOV to this matter , and the matter of OOV OOV OOV , the report OOV a number of other important proposals for OOV safety measures .
I OOV issues such as OOV OOV in the OOV , OOV education and OOV systems .
<P> OOV OOV , one question which I consider to be of the OOV importance but which , OOV , was not OOV by the Committee is that of the need for better working conditions for OOV OOV .
<P> The European Parliament has always been a OOV for the OOV of OOV road safety , and we have to continue in this OOV .
It is a matter of the life and health of OOV people - but , OOV all , those of the young citizens of Europe .
<SPEAKER OOV OOV " > Mr President , OOV OOV on Europe ' s OOV is OOV too many .
This OOV OOV with OOV to all the OOV taking place OOV the world , but we do not give OOV attention to the OOV OOV at work on the OOV of Europe .
OOV in any way OOV the OOV of OOV OOV OOV I am OOV OOV for a OOV of OOV .
OOV more of our OOV OOV OOV in OOV OOV than from OOV
This should be a OOV for OOV .
<P> I would like to thank the Commission for its OOV OOV of the situation .
EU cooperation is OOV more than OOV , as there are OOV OOV in the OOV of road safety within our Community .
OOV OOV as many people OOV in road OOV in OOV than in OOV .
However , there is OOV more OOV for OOV in every country .
The OOV environment must be made to become as OOV as possible , but OOV are always responsible for their own safety and that of OOV on the road .
A OOV in a OOV is OOV OOV , but when it is being used OOV it is like a OOV OOV .
OOV OOV are not OOV OOV OOV that OOV can OOV to their own OOV .
The time for OOV on our OOV is OOV : we need just as OOV OOV with the OOV on the OOV as we do with OOV OOV .
<P> I will OOV three important OOV of OOV the number of road OOV .
OOV , there is OOV with OOV OOV .
I often OOV in the Mediterranean countries , and , believe it or not , OOV to within the OOV OOV , and I am OOV being OOV .
OOV it is no OOV , because only very OOV do I see any OOV OOV in OOV .
The OOV OOV for these areas OOV OOV .
This OOV is OOV for in human life and the OOV of those OOV OOV .
OOV two out of every three OOV in Europe go over the OOV OOV in OOV areas and OOV OOV the OOV OOV on the open road .
If OOV OOV should be OOV from OOV OOV , OOV OOV OOV should be OOV from the OOV .
OOV OOV , if not very OOV , OOV is OOV OOV OOV and OOV OOV .
OOV in my country , OOV , the EUR OOV OOV OOV OOV by some OOV to just OOV OOV OOV .
<P> OOV , in OOV OOV : there is OOV in OOV .
It is also OOV that OOV OOV a part in no less than OOV OOV OOV of OOV a year .
I think it is important that Member States OOV to an OOV OOV of OOV OOV OOV , which can also be OOV .
If Member States OOV the OOV to do this , the matter must be OOV with through OOV at European level .
OOV OOV have to be OOV from their own OOV .
In OOV OOV of OOV OOV , or when the OOV is well over the OOV , there should be a long OOV and the OOV should be OOV by the state .
<P> The third point has to do with OOV .
OOV OOV on OOV OOV to OOV and OOV OOV on the road .
OOV country is a OOV example of this .
OOV is the OOV of Europe when it OOV to the OOV of OOV .
OOV that OOV OOV safety OOV should also OOV from OOV OOV .
In general , OOV should OOV on a OOV ' s use and not its OOV OOV .
OOV and gentlemen , I wish you a OOV OOV .
OOV to OOV your safety OOV in the back too .
<SPEAKER OOV NAME=" OOV " > Mr President , first of all I thank the rapporteur for OOV OOV work on behalf of us all and also thank Mr OOV for his contribution , OOV on behalf of the OOV Group .
I fully OOV many of the points he made , not least in respect of OOV OOV .
In fact there are only two points that I wish to make this OOV .
They OOV to OOV OOV OOV and the very important issue of OOV OOV .
<P> On OOV OOV OOV , I think it is OOV OOV out how clearly the rapporteur has made the case for the Commissioner to come forward with a directive .
In fact this Commissioner OOV to this House in OOV last year , a year OOV , that we would have a directive on OOV OOV OOV .
A year on there is no directive .
What we have in OOV is a OOV .
OOV OOV .
No action .
OOV , two OOV people in the last year have OOV , OOV OOV their OOV because the Commission would rather OOV than OOV .
I hope OOV and OOV the Commission OOV to the vote of this House and OOV to OOV with its OOV to have a directive on OOV OOV OOV .
No more OOV , OOV .
OOV us see some action .
<P> OOV , indeed , the same is OOV for OOV OOV .
We have had OOV on this issue , year in , year out .
We all know that OOV OOV people a year in Europe are OOV in OOV OOV .
We must OOV that particular problem .
But I find it OOV OOV , and I am OOV the OOV is not OOV , that on the very OOV that we are OOV OOV OOV , OOV OOV , road safety , the OOV before this Parliament is to vote on OOV OOV , the Commissioner has already made OOV OOV up .
OOV has OOV a OOV on OOV OOV .
It would have been OOV , would it not , for the Commissioner to have at least OOV to the debate , OOV what the OOV of the vote was OOV , before OOV OOV to OOV the OOV OOV and issue this OOV .
We know a OOV , OOV , is OOV not OOV the OOV it is OOV on .
Member States need and support clear OOV .
We believe it is time for the Commissioner to get OOV on OOV OOV and OOV OOV , to come forward with a directive to OOV the OOV to OOV OOV .
<P> In the United OOV , which has OOV had a good OOV , we have OOV OOV over the OOV OOV a OOV in the OOV of people OOV and OOV .
In my own region , in some OOV of my region , OOV % of OOV OOV were OOV the OOV legal OOV of OOV OOV .
It is quite clear that we need action .
OOV the OOV government is OOV for a OOV at European level , in a European OOV .
So all I make is a very OOV OOV to the Commissioner OOV to OOV to the debate and to OOV the vote OOV .
<SPEAKER OOV OOV " NAME=" OOV OOV " > Mr President , Commissioner , first of all , I would like to thank the rapporteur for OOV OOV report on a subject which OOV the OOV OOV of every OOV , OOV he or OOV OOV to be in Europe , OOV our own safety on the OOV and that of our OOV .
I would like to OOV three particular points .
<P> OOV , I would OOV OOV up European legislation with regard to a European OOV OOV and the OOV OOV OOV OOV .
OOV OOV years of EU OOV OOV , it is clear OOV all OOV that these OOV are of OOV and that OOV of OOV can be OOV every year as a result .
This is OOV OOV for many OOV and OOV , particularly in a OOV OOV country such as the OOV , but also OOV of course .
<P> OOV course it is very OOV of Commissioner OOV to OOV the OOV industry more time to make their own OOV , the OOV approach , again OOV them time OOV OOV , but now in OOV , but it is all taking too long for my OOV .
OOV also means making OOV , and the time is OOV for this .
<P> A second point I would like to OOV OOV to OOV OOV in the OOV .
OOV OOV of my group will support the rapporteur ' s proposal to OOV an EU OOV OOV an OOV OOV of OOV OOV OOV .
We do not wish to OOV this OOV but we do think that OOV of this OOV will OOV people ' s legal OOV in a Union where many citizens OOV the OOV OOV OOV , and where the OOV of OOV is OOV what we want to OOV .
I am not in favour of OOV OOV OOV for certain OOV of young OOV OOV .
The OOV we OOV out must be clear .
OOV a OOV is OOV or it is not .
OOV OOV % is a OOV responsible , OOV OOV and OOV OOV to my OOV .
<P> OOV , Commissioner , I would just like to OOV OOV of the fact that I think it is extremely OOV towards Parliament that the Commissioner OOV already OOV , in OOV of this OOV ' s debate - in which , when all is said and done , people are OOV for a OOV on the OOV OOV - that a OOV to the Member States will OOV .
This will OOV a OOV OOV and will certainly do OOV to increase OOV from the citizens ' OOV .
<P> OOV OOV point OOV to the OOV OOV OOV ' OOV .
I have a problem with this .
OOV OOV must be OOV and OOV , that is what OOV and OOV .
OOV we can OOV the number of OOV , but it would be OOV OOV to believe we could OOV road OOV OOV .
<SPEAKER OOV LANGUAGE="ES " NAME=" OOV OOV " > Mr President , Commissioner , OOV I would like to OOV my OOV for the OOV work done by Mrs OOV OOV .
There are many OOV for the OOV and the extremely high number of OOV on European OOV .
The OOV are many and OOV , and the report has been able to OOV and OOV the most important OOV .
OOV , the Commission OOV on OOV in road safety OOV OOV points OOV the OOV on which we can have the OOV OOV in order to achieve better results .
<P> I am going to OOV on the OOV which OOV to the management of the OOV OOV on the OOV and the OOV of the OOV of OOV on road OOV .
A high number of OOV OOV are OOV of OOV OOV , OOV and OOV , for which OOV are also OOV .
For cultural and OOV OOV , there are an OOV number of these OOV in certain Member States .
OOV OOV have OOV that the OOV of serious OOV or OOV OOV these OOV result from OOV with OOV OOV , that is to say , against OOV OOV OOV or against OOV road OOV , both of which are OOV and OOV for OOV OOV .
<P> The OOV of these OOV OOV at the OOV OOV which some Member States are OOV and OOV .
OOV OOV of the OOV proposal on the OOV and OOV of these OOV OOV OOV at these OOV OOV is not therefore OOV .
We must not be OOV with a OOV OOV to the Member States or OOV this OOV to be OOV with through OOV , which would OOV OOV its implementation .
<P> We must now be OOV .
OOV us OOV , OOV us OOV a greater OOV of OOV , OOV us OOV measures for the OOV and OOV use of OOV by OOV and OOV , and OOV us OOV OOV to OOV OOV OOV , at least in OOV areas ; OOV us OOV the OOV OOV by means of an OOV legal framework , as the Commission OOV in OOV , OOV OOV the Member States ' OOV .
OOV us be OOV of the environmental OOV of OOV , such as OOV and environmental OOV .
I would also like to OOV the importance of OOV on the OOV OOV OOV of OOV .
<P> Finally , I would like to thank the Commissioner for being so very open to our proposals .
<SPEAKER OOV LANGUAGE="DE " NAME=" OOV > Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , the OOV OOV of OOV OOV a year on the OOV of the European Union , the OOV OOV million OOV , are a OOV OOV that we must give OOV priority to the issue of road safety .
These OOV do not only OOV OOV OOV OOV , they also OOV OOV economic OOV and costs .
These are OOV at EUR OOV OOV , OOV for some OOV % of the OOV OOV OOV of all the European Member States .
That is more than all the European Union Member States put together OOV on OOV .
<P> I want to give OOV OOV to the rapporteur and I especially welcome the fact that OOV has OOV on three priority areas : OOV OOV , OOV OOV and OOV OOV and OOV .
In my view that OOV it clear that road safety cannot be OOV to the OOV level by OOV , OOV measures but only by a whole OOV of measures , which OOV road OOV education , OOV OOV , OOV OOV , better road infrastructure , OOV OOV systems , OOV OOV safety OOV , OOV OOV on OOV of road OOV rules and also OOV OOV of OOV on the OOV .
<P> That is why I find it extremely OOV that the OOV on OOV the OOV of OOV that have been involved in OOV in the European Union was not adopted , although OOV reports clearly OOV that there is a OOV OOV between OOV that have been in an OOV once and their OOV OOV in OOV with an OOV OOV OOV OOV .
<P> I just want to OOV the OOV OOV for a OOV .
You know I OOV an OOV concerned in particular with the question of OOV and safety OOV , and I would be OOV if you and your group could OOV it OOV , since I OOV am a OOV and am therefore OOV very OOV with this problem .
<SPEAKER OOV LANGUAGE="DE " NAME=" OOV > Mr President , I can only support the Commission in not OOV a Community OOV on OOV OOV OOV .
OOV OOV are OOV a OOV debate , a OOV OOV debate .
The OOV and our group OOV OOV a year OOV , when the proposals from the OOV OOV were taken up again , that we do not want Community legislation here .
The point we make is this : we want OOV .
That is the OOV question , not what the law OOV .
It is OOV to have OOV OOV .
OOV I can only OOV to my OOV OOV : if your OOV OOV out OOV over OOV , it would take these people OOV the OOV and OOV the OOV .
<P> So I can only OOV that the OOV OOV is to OOV the OOV OOV level rather than to issue a Community OOV .
That is why we will OOV the first part of OOV No OOV . If it is OOV OOV , my group will OOV Mrs OOV 's OOV resolution , because it is OOV to call for Community legislation when there is no need OOV for it .
OOV to your countries .
OOV countries agree with the common view of this House that OOV OOV OOV OOV is quite OOV , as the Commission OOV said .
That is what we OOV to all these countries .
The people you should OOV to , Mr OOV , are those who do not OOV that .
<P> So it is not a question of a OOV debate or of what the law OOV ; the OOV must OOV OOV OOV OOV and OOV out all the OOV OOV .
That will give us the OOV road safety .
<P> OOV , we will not OOV OOV No OOV OOV , with which the OOV are once again OOV to start another OOV debate , OOV on a general OOV OOV of OOV OOV .
We already have OOV OOV on most European OOV .
In my country we have OOV OOV on OOV % of all OOV .
OOV do the OOV OOV ?
On the OOV % of OOV , because there are not enough OOV OOV there OOV .
So , OOV OOV and more OOV will do more for road safety .
<SPEAKER OOV OOV NAME=" OOV " > Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , it is a OOV fact that , if OOV from OOV OOV is OOV to human OOV , then OOV from road OOV OOV are OOV OOV to human OOV .
OOV it not only OOV an OOV state not to be OOV in its own OOV and OOV ; it must also OOV its citizens from the OOV of their own OOV .
<P> It is as part of this OOV that the excellent report by our OOV OOV , Mrs OOV OOV , on the Commission OOV on the OOV in road safety OOV the way forward .
OOV is OOV on three OOV : first , by taking OOV , OOV action , OOV , by OOV new OOV in OOV and in the road infrastructure and , OOV , by taking OOV action and OOV an information OOV .
<P> OOV course , if we take OOV to ensure that any measures taken OOV OOV support , then they will be even more OOV and if , at the same time , we OOV on the OOV of the Member States in these areas , then we shall be OOV to OOV a OOV OOV .
For example , OOV could agree to a OOV OOV in OOV OOV for certain OOV of OOV , such as those OOV OOV OOV .
In OOV , OOV OOV can and should be used in order to put the measures OOV into OOV and to OOV the OOV of current OOV .
OOV , of course , we should OOV local society and regional OOV and ensure that they are more OOV involved in road safety issues by OOV the people OOV .
At the same time , the information OOV must , of course , continue to OOV , OOV OOV OOV of OOV through to the public , especially young people .
<P> OOV , it might be OOV OOV the OOV of OOV the OOV OOV through the road OOV system and OOV OOV safety OOV OOV on the OOV of road , so that road OOV and OOV can be OOV into programmes OOV by the European Union .
Finally , we call on the Commission not to OOV " through OOV such as today 's .
That is what road safety needs .
<SPEAKER OOV OOV " NAME=" OOV , OOV > Mr President , the OOV of road OOV is so OOV and so OOV as to OOV the OOV of all possible OOV as OOV as possible at all OOV of government and on all OOV of the matter , including human OOV , the infrastructure and OOV .
The only OOV OOV we need - although I OOV this will be difficult , given the OOV of the debate OOV far - is to OOV the OOV which would be most OOV OOV because they are OOV to OOV .
<P> I believe that the areas of human OOV and OOV are those in which we can OOV the OOV results : for example , the results of making it OOV to OOV a OOV and OOV OOV were OOV in OOV .
OOV OOV have OOV by OOV % OOV all the OOV OOV since it was made OOV to OOV a OOV last year .
I am aware that measures such as making it OOV to OOV OOV OOV and OOV can be difficult to OOV , to OOV , and that if they are not OOV then they are OOV , OOV words on OOV .
However , this does not OOV that we should OOV the OOV issue , and I would therefore not be against OOV OOV common OOV OOV OOV , even OOV OOV might OOV out OOV .
<SPEAKER OOV LANGUAGE="FR" NAME=" OOV " > Mr President , we shall be OOV in favour of the report on OOV in EU road safety , as it OOV a number of OOV measures which may OOV , at least OOV , the number of OOV in road OOV .
It is OOV that road OOV OOV the most common OOV of OOV OOV OOV and OOV under OOV years .
However , although most of the measures are positive , they OOV OOV OOV , OOV OOV OOV OOV as well as the government , and society in general , of any responsibility .
<P> What is the point of measures , OOV or OOV , to OOV OOV to OOV their OOV down , when OOV OOV not only OOV OOV that OOV OOV OOV OOV but even make this a OOV point ?
What is the point of OOV upon OOV to be OOV and to OOV the time they OOV at the OOV , when , in the OOV for OOV , the road OOV industry and OOV OOV and OOV OOV OOV OOV OOV to OOV OOV they are extremely OOV ?
What is the point of OOV the fact that road OOV OOV for OOV % of OOV OOV all OOV of transport - there is OOV no possible OOV with OOV or OOV - if every government ' s policy is to OOV road transport , OOV or OOV , over all other OOV of transport , for both the public and OOV .
OOV in Europe ' s OOV countries , public transport is OOV and many people use their OOV not through OOV but out of OOV , OOV to a OOV of OOV public transport .
<P> In the OOV for OOV and OOV OOV , OOV OOV are OOV to see road transport as part of their OOV OOV and this OOV some OOV into a long , OOV OOV OOV of OOV .
OOV on the OOV question of OOV OOV , what OOV in OOV OOV is the OOV of the OOV OOV .
On a more general OOV , a OOV approach to transport would OOV a OOV approach to OOV , an approach , in other words , that does not place OOV OOV all OOV .
This , however , is a far OOV from the OOV measures OOV by the Commission and by this report .
<P> <SPEAKER OOV OOV NAME=" OOV " > Mr President , OOV of the Commission , I OOV the OOV OOV OOV this OOV OOV and I was OOV to OOV that , OOV at least , more than OOV people have been OOV on the OOV of the European Union since we OOV this OOV .
The European Union OOV OOV people an OOV .
OOV OOV OOV are the most common OOV of OOV OOV OOV and young people .
OOV year , we OOV a OOV or OOV OOV full of young people no less , because OOV young people OOV on our OOV every year .
OOV to that the fact that I OOV have the OOV OOV of OOV from the Member State with the second OOV number of OOV OOV in Europe .
OOV what is more , OOV is the only country in Europe in which , OOV , there has been no OOV OOV over the last OOV years .
OOV OOV are being OOV on the OOV OOV .
<P> OOV safety can , and must , be a OOV priority both for the whole of Europe and for each OOV country , which is why I shall support the proposal made by Mrs OOV OOV , OOV I should like to OOV on OOV report , that we need OOV OOV for road safety and we need to set a OOV of OOV but OOV OOV OOV .
This will OOV citizens ' attention and provide an OOV OOV point .
We , ladies and gentlemen , have a OOV responsibility both here and in OOV .
It is , for example , OOV that no OOV proposal has been OOV on the OOV OOV of the OOV OOV of OOV OOV to make OOV OOV OOV for OOV , a OOV programme which , it should be OOV , the European Union has been OOV for the OOV OOV years .
<P> In OOV , further support for the European programme to OOV OOV OOV , support for OOV to OOV the use of OOV OOV , the development of OOV systems , the OOV OOV of OOV OOV OOV to OOV and OOV and other proposals in the report could OOV road safety and public health OOV at OOV OOV OOV .
<SPEAKER OOV OOV " NAME=" OOV > Mrs OOV OOV , I am OOV that you are OOV with part of your OOV which OOV a OOV OOV between the different Member States in the quality and safety of OOV and number of OOV OOV .
OOV , this OOV OOV OOV the OOV in the quality and OOV of economic OOV of the Member States of the European Union : the OOV country is OOV and the least OOV countries are OOV and OOV .
What does this OOV ?
I will OOV to OOV this question as OOV as possible : it means we cannot OOV in safety without OOV in Community action .
<P> I feel that Parliament , with a few OOV OOV , is OOV for greater OOV from the Commission , and I would therefore like to thank the OOV Member for OOV report , which OOV the Commission 's OOV OOV clear and more OOV .
OOV OOV - to get OOV to the point - means two things : OOV an OOV to OOV OOV and rules in our OOV policy , or - without OOV to OOV Mr OOV - any OOV will be OOV .
If we are going to OOV the OOV at which people OOV , it does make quite a OOV whether the OOV we set is OOV or OOV OOV OOV OOV .
<P> The same OOV to OOV .
We feel that the Commission should present a directive OOV the OOV OOV OOV OOV at OOV OOV OOV OOV for all the Member States .
I say this as a OOV of a country which has OOV a OOV OOV OOV in order to OOV any OOV of OOV in our OOV .
The principle of OOV is all very well - although I feel that it would be OOV OOV to take OOV the OOV of all OOV OOV - but the problem is working out at what point a OOV is to be OOV OOV OOV to our OOV OOV .
<P> Commissioner , I feel that OOV this OOV of OOV is the OOV and most OOV , but also the only way of OOV the OOV OOV we have set OOV of OOV the number of OOV OOV by the OOV of the European Union by OOV % over the next few years .
<SPEAKER OOV LANGUAGE="SV" NAME=" OOV " > Mr President , OOV me thank the rapporteur for the great OOV OOV has OOV in this matter .
<P> OOV year , OOV OOV people were OOV on the road OOV of the OOV
OOV of the main OOV for this was the use of OOV .
There is no OOV OOV from this fact .
OOV years in the European Parliament have given me great respect for the fact that we have OOV OOV OOV on many issues , but we should all agree that OOV and OOV OOV go together .
OOV this , people are OOV every OOV on the road OOV of the EU because of this OOV OOV .
<P> We can also OOV very different OOV as to whether we should have common rules within the EU or whether each country should OOV this problem on its own .
OOV me to point out two things for those who are in two OOV about this issue .
<P> OOV first point is that no EU country would find it OOV if another Member State OOV a situation in which a OOV OOV , an OOV OOV OOV an OOV with OOV OOV on OOV or a OOV OOV responsible for the safety of OOV people or were to OOV OOV before he or OOV OOV responsibility for his or OOV OOV .
OOV is it , then , that we do not OOV the same OOV on those who OOV on our OOV ?
<P> The other point I want to make is that OOV % of OOV OOV OOV actually take place on the OOV .
OOV I want is that we should take the problem of these OOV % as OOV as we do the problem of the OOV % of OOV which OOV in OOV with the other OOV of transport .
That is OOV why I consider the report to be an OOV basis for our future work on this issue , which is also why I am going to vote in favour of it OOV .
<SPEAKER OOV LANGUAGE="DE " NAME=" OOV " > Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , safety on Europe 's OOV is a OOV matter and the OOV OOV for themselves : OOV OOV OOV a year and OOV million people OOV .
OOV has to be done about this .
We must OOV to make our OOV OOV .
There is very great OOV OOV those who OOV a OOV OOV as a result of a OOV OOV .
OOV society is OOV OOV OOV , and I am in favour of it .
But that is OOV why it is our OOV to OOV the OOV .
OOV , we as OOV must OOV our responsibility towards society at European , as also at national and regional level , and call for better and more OOV road OOV measures .
<P> The OOV of road OOV is OOV .
The way to OOV OOV OOV therefore OOV OOV , OOV and OOV OOV OOV .
A OOV OOV of what OOV on the OOV can provide important OOV to help ensure greater safety and OOV OOV .
The OOV OOV of transport OOV , as also road OOV and people themselves , are OOV points .
We must OOV and OOV where possible to OOV them .
I see this as a most important OOV .
OOV here I think road OOV education is OOV .
<P> We must OOV people 's OOV of the OOV and OOV involved in road use , as the OOV for their OOV of measures .
OOV OOV , a OOV OOV group of road OOV , must be OOV through OOV how to OOV on the OOV .
OOV people must be OOV of the OOV they and other road OOV OOV once they have OOV their OOV OOV .
<P> OOV point is especially OOV to my OOV : measures against OOV OOV but also against the use of OOV and OOV when OOV .
OOV measures have already been taken to OOV OOV OOV , including many OOV measures .
OOV people often do not OOV that taking OOV and OOV can OOV their OOV and OOV their OOV just as much .
<P> The EU road safety programme OOV to OOV the main OOV clearly .
OOV all , we need to take a OOV approach to these problems .
It is OOV to call for cooperation between the Commission and the Member States .
<SPEAKER OOV LANGUAGE="DE " OOV " > Mr President , Commissioner , road OOV are the most OOV OOV of OOV and serious OOV OOV OOV and young people , in fact OOV OOV EU citizens under the OOV of OOV .
We must no OOV OOV this as a OOV of OOV but must do something about it .
The OOV , however , is that we OOV OOV that road safety OOV OOV on how well road OOV OOV or OOV in OOV of themselves .
<P> OOV from OOV out a clear OOV , OOV OOV and OOV of the OOV Treaty also provide us with the legal basis which some Members of this House OOV for a great number of OOV measures to improve road OOV safety .
It is up to us OOV to OOV OOV political priority to this issue .
In fact , there is OOV OOV any policy area in which the common responsibility of the EU , the Member States , regional and local authorities and the appropriate organisations is OOV so clearly .
OOV is , therefore , particularly OOV here .
<P> That is OOV why we should not OOV the OOV OOV of EU measures OOV Member State efforts .
OOV of the economic costs of OOV OOV OOV that they are OOV OOV than the costs of OOV OOV OOV .
So that OOV the call for OOV financial resources even in OOV of economic OOV .
But OOV , OOV us make no OOV .
It is not always the case that the more OOV we put in , the OOV the level of safety we can achieve .
<P> This can be OOV by information OOV on best OOV in the EU OOV and OOV measures to OOV the OOV of OOV , such as OOV , OOV and the use of OOV , as also a directive on OOV safety OOV which will make the OOV industry take a more OOV approach and OOV the European OOV OOV OOV OOV ( OOV ) .
I OOV the rapporteur , Mrs OOV OOV , on OOV excellent report and OOV you to OOV it .
<SPEAKER OOV LANGUAGE="SV" NAME=" OOV OOV " > Mr President , Commissioner , it is OOV to OOV to this OOV and it will be OOV to continue working on the issue of road OOV safety in Parliament after this OOV and after our decision OOV .
I am OOV that the OOV of the political OOV consider a OOV at European level on OOV OOV to be OOV , since this is an OOV OOV which we can OOV by OOV of the Treaty .
I agree with Mr OOV when he OOV - and this is made OOV by the OOV OOV - that we should OOV OOV safety OOV that are OOV than those which it is possible to OOV about .
However , this is something we do OOV when it OOV to OOV but which , of course , we do not where OOV is concerned .
In my opinion , it is important to have such a OOV at European level where OOV is concerned .
<P> Mr OOV OOV some OOV OOV but , OOV Mr OOV , I think that we should OOV the opportunity of OOV a directive as well as OOV OOV OOV and other OOV .
We need to OOV all OOV , and that is what we shall do .
We have not said no to a directive before .
OOV , we have the OOV of taking a political initiative , so OOV us do so .
<P> OOV now , Mr OOV , to the issue of OOV OOV , which was OOV by the OOV , I believe that it is important for us to OOV an OOV on what OOV .
It would be OOV to see a report on the situation out there in the Union .
I am well aware of the fact that this is an important issue for OOV and OOV .
<P> Finally , there is the matter of education and the situation of OOV .
OOV as Mrs OOV said , we need to have road safety education .
We must OOV this opportunity , together with all the other measures at national , local , regional , and European level .
We must make OOV OOV efforts to this end .
<SPEAKER OOV LANGUAGE="ES " NAME=" OOV OOV > Mr President , I would OOV like to OOV Mrs OOV OOV OOV on the very OOV OOV for a resolution which OOV has OOV on road safety .
This OOV the European Parliament ' s interest - which we have OOV today in your OOV - in OOV an OOV policy for OOV the OOV of OOV OOV .
I would also like to OOV my OOV to all of you who have OOV , who have given OOV to your OOV and who have OOV this debate .
<P> In OOV to the European Parliament ' s OOV , I would OOV you that last OOV the Commission OOV a OOV on road safety which OOV a OOV of OOV measures to be OOV over the next few years , OOV the last two years of implementation of the second action programme on road safety .
<P> I would like to OOV that , in general , I am in OOV agreement with the OOV of the report and also with what the resolution itself OOV , both with regard to the action programme under way , OOV implementation will OOV be OOV , and with regard to the future road safety programme which the Commission OOV to present in the next few OOV .
<P> I also wish the European Union to have an OOV and OOV policy for OOV the number of OOV , which is OOV OOV OOV .
In the first OOV we will have to OOV the OOV priority measures OOV within the framework of the road safety programme , which is OOV under way and , in particular , OOV that the OOV to OOV OOV OOV be OOV to a greater number of OOV , OOV by OOV the OOV OOV which such a OOV is OOV .
OOV , we will have to OOV the OOV of information on OOV OOV and the OOV for OOV them and , in general , to increase the safety of road OOV and OOV measures to improve the OOV OOV in the OOV of OOV with OOV OOV of the road OOV .
These road OOV must OOV a different OOV for current OOV OOV , which are OOV OOV to OOV and OOV .
<P> The second OOV must OOV the OOV of a more OOV approach with regard to the future action programme , for which we must OOV OOV OOV on a European OOV , which will be OOV up with the cooperation of the Member States , in order to achieve greater OOV and OOV between the measures adopted in OOV and those OOV on a national level .
OOV it is clear that the OOV of specific OOV - as we have OOV in those countries which have adopted them - OOV a OOV and has the OOV of a OOV OOV on the authorities , which OOV to them OOV better OOV and therefore to a OOV in OOV .
<P> OOV , I do not OOV today to deal with the OOV on which we agree - you know these from the OOV - but I would like to OOV a OOV more on the OOV for the two points of OOV .
The first is OOV .
OOV and gentlemen , you are OOV right .
OOV or the OOV before , the OOV OOV on the OOV for OOV to be the OOV OOV for OOV in the OOV was OOV adopted by the Commission .
The OOV is OOV OOV .
It was in the OOV in OOV .
You must not believe that there has been any OOV by OOV .
I OOV that this was at a more OOV OOV .
I am OOV .
OOV do not OOV that the OOV has been in any way OOV to OOV with this debate .
But I would like to OOV why no proposal for a directive is being OOV .
This is not being done for two OOV OOV .
OOV , I must say that the United OOV , one of the countries where the OOV OOV is greater than the OOV which we OOV OOV Mr OOV mentioned a OOV OOV - is the country with the second OOV number of OOV in the European Union after OOV .
If OOV OOV had a OOV of OOV OOV of OOV it would OOV be the country with the OOV number rather than the second OOV and would have far OOV OOV .
I do not know .
What I OOV to point out is that it is a fact , an OOV fact , that OOV OOV , with a OOV of OOV , is the country with the second OOV number of OOV in the Union .
<P> I am not OOV OOV but OOV .
It is not enough to OOV or to OOV down that an OOV OOV be OOV if the national authorities then OOV to OOV OOV the OOV of that OOV OOV in OOV ' OOV .
I would like to say to you that if some Member States do not OOV OOV the OOV OOV in OOV , I OOV that we will have better results just because we have OOV it to OOV .
What we need is better OOV on the part of the authorities .
<P> OOV , there are OOV , OOV and OOV why I feel that this is the OOV OOV of issue which should be OOV to OOV , and that is why we are only OOV the level of OOV .
I know that you have a different opinion - I have OOV it - and , of course , the OOV is that , OOV , there has not so far been a OOV OOV in the Council to OOV forward with an initiative of this OOV .
If , OOV , all the Member States agree , it will be very OOV for them , OOV other things , to OOV a level of OOV in their countries .
OOV not OOV me that the United OOV OOV a European directive to OOV a problem in OOV OOV because I would not believe it .
OOV OOV them OOV OOV in the United OOV .
OOV do we have to OOV them to do so ?
If the United OOV OOV to do it and we already have a OOV , OOV them OOV with it .
<P> OOV regard to OOV OOV , I clearly OOV Mr OOV ' s OOV that the Commission OOV to OOV and not to OOV .
I cannot OOV that OOV .
The Commission OOV to OOV in the most OOV way and , OOV , OOV an initiative for a few OOV can , in OOV , be a much OOV way to ensure that it is OOV .
OOV we have given the OOV OOV OOV OOV to OOV an agreement .
They do not have OOV OOV , Mr OOV , but OOV OOV OOV .
In this respect , I would like to OOV you that this initiative is not only my responsibility but it is also the responsibility of the Commissioner for OOV , Mr OOV , and that is what we agreed .
<P> In OOV this I wish to point out that we have by no means OOV the OOV of OOV a OOV in OOV to OOV OOV of OOV which are more OOV when it OOV to OOV OOV people - OOV OOV - but that we OOV wish to be even more OOV by OOV the support of the OOV sector .
<P> OOV regard to the future action programme for OOV , we are a OOV open to all the OOV OOV in the OOV for a resolution .
I am even OOV to OOV the issue of the level of OOV .
I am not going to OOV OOV OOV on this issue .
I do not believe that that is the main problem .
The problem of OOV is much more important .
In any OOV , I am OOV on your cooperation , your help and your support , and I OOV the rapporteur once again .
<SPEAKER OOV NAME=" OOV " > Mr President , my OOV was mentioned .
It is important for the OOV to OOV the situation in the OOV OOV to the OOV Government 's view on OOV OOV .
I am OOV that the OOV on OOV and OOV has a OOV of the OOV 's road safety OOV that was OOV in OOV 2000 .
It OOV it very clear that the new government in the United OOV is OOV to a OOV within a European OOV .
I believe you would now find a much more positive OOV to a proposal for a directive than OOV was the case with the OOV OOV .
<SPEAKER OOV NAME=" OOV > Mr President , on a point of order .
If I have OOV my OOV OOV , then it is enough to have a OOV that the OOV Government will OOV the OOV level .
<SPEAKER OOV NAME=" President " > The debate is OOV .
<P> The vote will take place OOV at OOV OOV .
OOV OOV OOV and OOV OOV transport <SPEAKER OOV NAME=" President " > The next OOV is the report ( OOV ) by Mrs OOV OOV , on behalf of the Committee on OOV OOV , OOV and OOV , on the OOV from the Commission to the European Parliament , the Council and the OOV and OOV Committee on the progress of the implementation of the action programme of the OOV on OOV and OOV OOV transport in the European Union .
<SPEAKER OOV OOV " NAME=" OOV OOV " > Mr President , Commissioner , I will OOV from OOV OOV , OOV the OOV which the Commission itself has used in the OOV OOV .
However , the OOV OOV OOV are OOV OOV more OOV for a number of OOV : the need to OOV OOV and OOV OOV OOV , and economic and environmental OOV , for OOV is a OOV OOV in OOV OOV .
<P> As OOV OOV , OOV OOV a OOV of OOV OOV from the OOV of OOV between the various OOV of transport , together with OOV OOV to some of these OOV .
The development of OOV OOV OOV upon the level of OOV OOV by the rail services on OOV , which OOV , in many Member States , OOV OOV in terms of quality , OOV and OOV .
<P> OOV , as the Commission has OOV out on OOV OOV , the development of infrastructure OOV to OOV on OOV systems , OOV OOV transport OOV a OOV approach OOV on OOV and OOV between the various OOV .
<P> OOV , open OOV information systems able to OOV OOV transport and OOV services OOV and to OOV a OOV and OOV OOV information and OOV OOV have yet to be put in place .
<P> A specific OOV of the OOV costs OOV to OOV OOV transport OOV that the main OOV OOV to OOV OOV transport can be OOV as high costs , OOV time OOV , OOV quality , OOV OOV of OOV to OOV , OOV as to the OOV of OOV that can be OOV , and more OOV OOV OOV .
These OOV costs can be OOV first and OOV to the OOV of OOV system OOV and OOV OOV the OOV , OOV to a OOV of OOV and an increase in OOV costs .
<P> OOV , the OOV OOV and OOV quality OOV OOV the various OOV of transport do not OOV OOV OOV OOV of OOV OOV and OOV OOV OOV .
The OOV is the OOV of OOV OOV OOV systems OOV different OOV in the OOV OOV and the OOV of an OOV and information system for OOV OOV on an OOV basis .
<P> OOV , the OOV system is OOV by a OOV of OOV OOV from the OOV of OOV time OOV and OOV OOV the various OOV of transport , as a result of which the needs of the OOV transport OOV do not OOV to the OOV OOV of the resources OOV in the process .
OOV way of OOV , the working OOV of OOV and OOV do not OOV with OOV OOV , and OOV are not always able to OOV OOV OOV and OOV OOV .
<P> OOV , the OOV transport framework in Europe OOV OOV , with OOV OOV OOV OOV in the various Member States .
OOV the need to OOV priority to the OOV of the different OOV , with the support of the OOV OOV OOV OOV , with a view to OOV out specific OOV of action OOV to OOV OOV OOV in OOV Member States .
<P> The OOV which the EU OOV to OOV through the development of OOV OOV to the need to OOV an OOV system OOV the various transport OOV which OOV OOV , OOV OOV services , OOV for OOV and OOV use of the transport system and OOV OOV between OOV .
In its OOV on OOV and OOV OOV transport in the European Union , the Commission OOV the OOV to be OOV in the OOV transport sector and OOV them into priority areas for action , OOV as OOV OOV " : infrastructure and OOV means of transport , OOV and OOV OOV OOV , and services and OOV common to all transport OOV .
<P> The OOV is to OOV an information system OOV for OOV transport management , as well as the use of OOV OOV in transport , by means of the development of OOV OOV information and OOV systems , the OOV of transport OOV , OOV and OOV OOV OOV OOV OOV OOV ( OOV systems , a OOV OOV OOV OOV to OOV the end OOV a clear set of OOV conditions and OOV with regard to OOV for OOV which may be OOV or OOV during OOV , the development of information society OOV of OOV to OOV transport , through the OOV of an open OOV which OOV it possible to OOV the OOV of OOV OOV the OOV OOV OOV , and OOV transport , OOV the OOV of OOV OOV and the OOV of a OOV OOV OOV .
<P> The Commission has also OOV a OOV of OOV measures , OOV OOV and OOV development OOV to OOV OOV OOV at OOV new OOV to OOV OOV services and increase OOV .
OOV , a OOV on OOV OOV , at the same time , a OOV cultural change in the OOV of OOV .
The OOV and OOV of the OOV are already OOV a OOV increase in the OOV for the OOV of OOV and OOV .
The high OOV OOV are OOV OOV which will OOV OOV the OOV OOV and , therefore , OOV and other OOV of OOV between OOV in the sector will be OOV OOV .
<P> Finally , I would like to thank the Members who OOV OOV to the OOV of a resolution OOV to the OOV of the committee .
<P> I should also like to OOV you that , as far as the few amendments OOV are concerned , I OOV OOV all of them , with the OOV of OOV No OOV , with regard to which I am OOV OOV by the OOV to State aid .
<SPEAKER OOV OOV " NAME=" OOV " > Mr President , OOV is still in its OOV .
OOV even OOV % of our OOV is OOV by OOV different OOV of transport .
OOV the OOV OOV on OOV have been OOV since as OOV as OOV , a OOV which OOV the use of more than one OOV of transport .
OOV is OOV out of all OOV too , and is OOV to increase by OOV % over the next OOV years .
It is OOV that there is no OOV in OOV transport in the OOV .
OOV the OOV on the OOV and the OOV is not yet so great as to OOV about this OOV .
But that being the case , a few OOV are in order for the OOV OOV .
<P> OOV , the road OOV will not be able to OOV with the OOV % increase , not in the OOV or regional OOV , and not in terms of long OOV transport OOV .
OOV OOV OOV on road transport must therefore be OOV a OOV of OOV OOV , which used to be a OOV OOV .
<P> OOV , environmental OOV will OOV an OOV important part over the next OOV years .
OOV a OOV through certain OOV of Europe will OOV with OOV OOV .
The people will put up OOV OOV OOV to transport OOV of their environment .
We have already OOV this in the OOV of the directive that OOV to OOV OOV on OOV OOV .
So there is no question of our being able to OOV for OOV .
We are being OOV into it .
OOV if you take that as your point of OOV , OOV of this is really going to make any OOV .
<P> OOV course the OOV must OOV themselves more OOV , and come up with some more OOV OOV , but then the government must get down to work too , and OOV and OOV OOV , for example .
The OOV OOV OOV must be OOV to OOV OOV and as a matter of priority .
OOV OOV about rail transport , but OOV transport - where there really is still OOV for OOV - no OOV OOV to OOV at all in the European or national OOV of OOV .
<P> No one OOV the efforts OOV by each OOV State , when that is OOV one of the OOV OOV of the European Commission .
It is a OOV because road transport , in OOV with OOV OOV could make a OOV OOV in OOV and OOV Europe .
But before we OOV that point , OOV OOV still have to be OOV OOV in terms of legislation , OOV of a OOV and OOV OOV .
OOV , the same OOV to the OOV OOV of OOV OOV , which has long OOV itself to be OOV out , but is now making a OOV OOV under the OOV OOV of OOV OOV OOV , OOV OOV OOV together at any OOV .
<P> If we look at the OOV that have been made since the excellent action programme of OOV , then we see a number of positive OOV , for example the OOV OOV transport OOV .
The OOV of the OOV programme , OOV OOV in OOV transport , will also OOV OOV on .
<P> In view of the fact that the Union is to OOV enlargement and OOV some new OOV before long , we must take account of the new situation during the OOV negotiations even now .
But OOV , OOV transport is still too OOV OOV .
This is down to OOV in the field of infrastructure , OOV in the field of management and information , and OOV that do not make the OOV .
<P> OOV the same , we must OOV a OOV transport OOV in the form of a OOV infrastructure OOV , and the OOV OOV and government must OOV OOV at all OOV in the process .
<SPEAKER OOV LANGUAGE="DE " NAME=" OOV " > Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , in transport policy we still do not OOV OOV transport the attention it OOV .
OOV , in fact , only OOV % of European OOV transport is OOV , as my OOV just said .
That is why this OOV of transport is often not taken OOV enough yet .
But OOV OOV transport is both the OOV and the OOV of the European OOV OOV , which OOV to OOV not only the OOV , national transport OOV but also the various transport OOV .
<P> OOV the OOV OOV that is not quite OOV yet and the OOV that has OOV , the OOV market needs this OOV OOV if it is to have a OOV future .
That is why the reports on the progress in OOV the action programme for OOV transport also OOV the progress made in European transport policy .
<P> The OOV from the Commission and the report have OOV many , indeed all the important issues : the OOV of the OOV OOV OOV at OOV a OOV OOV OOV , measures to OOV OOV OOV systems , the measures that are still OOV to OOV OOV OOV and so OOV , OOV OOV information , OOV transport OOV and OOV , the development of a OOV OOV OOV OOV and many OOV .
OOV , as we all know , we need a whole OOV of OOV , political measures to ensure that OOV transport really has a OOV future .
<P> OOV the framework conditions are so OOV and because the development of OOV transport is still far from being a OOV process , we need a great number of OOV OOV OOV .
So I hope we will get a OOV new OOV programme , that will be OOV by the OOV countries even at this OOV , for it is there that many of the decisions are taken that concern our future .
The OOV are not all set OOV there yet .
I also hope that we will give OOV transport OOV importance in the OOV OOV OOV OOV .
<P> In our view , in future OOV OOV should look more at OOV OOV , OOV OOV . at OOV up the OOV OOV OOV .
OOV OOV that has not really been OOV is this : OOV we could look into the conditions for OOV new European , OOV OOV .
For we do not yet have any real OOV in this area .
OOV , OOV at least , and as a OOV of OOV , an international OOV could OOV OOV OOV transport on an OOV basis .
<P> OOV course we are also in favour of the European OOV OOV for OOV that OOV being OOV and hope it will OOV become a OOV .
<SPEAKER OOV NAME=" OOV > Mr President , Commissioner , I would like to thank the rapporteur for OOV excellent work .
OOV group is in favour of OOV the report with its amendments .
<P> At present OOV is OOV OOV to OOV costs , OOV , OOV of infrastructure , and OOV also because road transport OOV to be OOV .
The report and the Commission OOV OOV many OOV OOV of support that would increase the OOV of OOV transport .
OOV OOV must be OOV OOV , for example in OOV OOV , so that the most OOV OOV and services can be OOV for various OOV .
<P> I would also like to point out that this form of transport is the most OOV system for long OOV .
In the development of transport OOV , priority must be given to OOV regions and areas which are OOV OOV in terms of the OOV OOV .
The OOV of OOV and OOV systems in OOV areas is OOV .
<SPEAKER OOV OOV " NAME=" OOV " > Mr President , Commissioner , first of all I would like to thank both the Commission and our rapporteur for their work on this issue .
We have already said a great deal on this subject , and so I shall OOV this very OOV .
We have been able to OOV that a OOV OOV has taken place in recent years , although the OOV in which , and the OOV to which , this has taken place has been very OOV to OOV .
We want to give this OOV a OOV OOV .
That being the case , it is important that the OOV themselves , OOV rail , OOV and OOV OOV , are OOV and that political OOV have been OOV too , in the form of OOV , OOV and a number of other things which the sector can use to OOV its OOV .
<P> OOV we would also like to increase the number of OOV available to OOV , in particular , although this OOV OOV financial OOV .
That is OOV why we have OOV an OOV for OOV of state aid to OOV , also for environmental OOV .
<P> OOV , I am not in agreement with the OOV OOV by the OOV OOV in these OOV , but that is something we should OOV on another OOV .
I would point out that the OOV increase in transport , also as a result of OOV , means that OOV , OOV transport is just a OOV in the OOV at the OOV , but will have to make OOV in the future .
<SPEAKER OOV OOV " NAME=" OOV > Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , road safety , OOV , the costs of transport infrastructure : my OOV on these issues , OOV one after the other on today 's OOV , is that of one who is concerned with the problems of OOV areas , particularly the OOV .
The subject of road safety OOV to OOV the OOV OOV OOV OOV , which is an example of the need for European OOV OOV safety in both OOV OOV and those under OOV .
<P> OOV there is the matter of OOV OOV the OOV , where , OOV from the OOV decision to OOV OOV in rail transport , there are serious OOV in the OOV of the other OOV and the other new rail OOV already OOV for by Community OOV , such as those OOV the OOV OOV , or under OOV , such as the OOV OOV .
OOV , if the OOV OOV " OOV OOV it OOV for it " or " OOV OOV " OOV up in a OOV on the OOV of the OOV , then , OOV from OOV OOV , there needs to be OOV OOV OOV OOV and more rail transport in the OOV region in future .
In the OOV , there needs to be OOV OOV of the number of OOV OOV OOV through the region , including the OOV OOV OOV when it OOV at the end of this year .
<SPEAKER OOV LANGUAGE="ES " NAME=" OOV OOV > Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I would OOV like to thank Mrs OOV OOV for this OOV and OOV report , and for OOV OOV , which OOV great support for the OOV of the Commission in this field .
I would also like to thank all the Members who have OOV in the debate today .
<P> The Commission OOV that an OOV OOV transport system for OOV is OOV to the Union and the OOV countries and , of course , it is OOV if we want to OOV OOV in the OOV years .
I believe that the OOV of an OOV OOV market , the OOV of our OOV and the OOV development of the Union OOV on this .
<P> The Commission will OOV the OOV transport OOV in the countries of OOV and OOV Europe in order OOV to OOV the OOV of the OOV for the OOV OOV OOV .
The European OOV OOV for OOV transport , with its OOV in OOV , will be OOV this year and will be OOV the information which the OOV industry needs and which may help in the OOV of new OOV .
<P> The Commission OOV to continue OOV OOV transport , through OOV in the framework programmes for OOV OOV and development and also by OOV and OOV the OOV OOV for OOV transport ( the OOV ) .
As the report OOV , we will have to OOV in the necessary infrastructure and its management .
In this respect , there are various OOV - Mr OOV , for example - who call for the great transport OOV which are already in the OOV to be OOV .
<P> We wish to OOV the use of current OOV resources , OOV their use , in order to OOV the OOV OOV of OOV transport by industry .
I must OOV you , ladies and gentlemen , that I hope , given the OOV of OOV and development , that we are now on the OOV OOV .
<P> OOV regard to the OOV OOV on the common transport policy , as well as the OOV of the OOV OOV OOV , which I have OOV you , I hope that the Commission will be able to OOV OOV a OOV on that issue over the next few OOV .
OOV transport is one of the OOV OOV in it .
<P> We are at an important OOV in the development of OOV transport , since we have to OOV on from OOV OOV OOV and OOV to OOV that industry OOV them in a OOV OOV .
The work that we have OOV has OOV that the OOV , systems and OOV OOV in Europe to OOV out this OOV of OOV , which OOV the OOV and OOV transport of OOV .
The OOV OOV that we are going to present will support the OOV of OOV transport .
<P> Finally , I would like to say that I am in OOV agreement with the proposals to OOV OOV OOV systems , made by different OOV , OOV OOV the rapporteur , Mr OOV and Mr OOV .
These OOV OOV systems must OOV support OOV transport : these support OOV are a OOV for OOV OOV European transport , which has a good OOV OOV and which OOV the environment .
<P> I am also very OOV with the agreement between Parliament and the Commission on this issue and I can OOV you that the services of the OOV OOV will continue to OOV an OOV role in the OOV of OOV transport .
<P> I would like to end by OOV the rapporteur and all the OOV and I hope I will continue being able to OOV on your work and cooperation on this subject , when it OOV to OOV the OOV OOV on transport .
<SPEAKER OOV NAME=" President " > OOV you , Commissioner .
<P> The debate is OOV .
<P> The vote will take place OOV at OOV OOV .
OOV OOV OOV for the use of transport infrastructure <SPEAKER OOV NAME=" President " > The next OOV is the report ( OOV ) by Mr OOV OOV , on behalf of the Committee on OOV OOV , OOV and OOV , on transport infrastructure OOV .
<SPEAKER OOV OOV " NAME=" OOV , OOV > Mr President , Commissioner , I am OOV to present this OOV report , OOV up by the OOV Committee on OOV OOV , OOV and OOV with the OOV of OOV about progress in an area which I hope our work will help you to OOV better .
<P> As you know , it OOV from a OOV Commission OOV OOV , which OOV for measures to OOV the OOV costs OOV by environmental , safety and OOV OOV , in order to OOV about a OOV and more OOV system of OOV OOV for OOV to transport infrastructure .
OOV , the report OOV upon the Commission to OOV by OOV the OOV of OOV and OOV costs , OOV or OOV OOV OOV OOV , and then , of course , OOV the implementation of these measures to OOV and the decisions to be taken by the Member States .
<P> In my opinion , in OOV , the report OOV that the OOV to OOV the OOV OOV " principle is OOV in the OOV principle of OOV OOV " .
This is its contribution , and it has two OOV which I wish to OOV now .
The first is that if the OOV which we hope the Commission will OOV upon and we will be able to OOV OOV us to OOV a OOV OOV of the OOV and OOV costs and a OOV system for OOV OOV , we will OOV the conditions to be able to OOV the OOV of infrastructure from OOV public resources and general OOV to the OOV as such .
We can therefore now OOV the OOV OOV before Europe - the Europe of today and the Europe of OOV - in the process of OOV new infrastructure , the OOV of OOV OOV OOV in this OOV as well , which would not be possible if we do not OOV in OOV this situation .
<P> The next OOV is to consider that , where the OOV of some of these costs is OOV , as , for example , in the case of the OOV OOV , which have already fully OOV their OOV - the OOV from these OOV which OOV today could OOV funds to be used in OOV , in order to ensure that certain costs OOV to road OOV OOV to improve infrastructure in other OOV of transport which are certainly more OOV OOV .
<P> I would OOV that this whole system , which OOV the financial OOV from the State to the OOV , must have a OOV , and that is the last principle , OOV to which those who have the most difficult OOV because they are OOV or because they OOV in OOV or OOV areas where OOV is difficult , can in some way be OOV , and a OOV of OOV , including State OOV , can therefore be OOV to OOV for this .
<P> OOV OOV in OOV this report is to OOV together certain OOV OOV which I have already mentioned : the OOV OOV " principle , the OOV OOV " principle and the principle of OOV OOV . together .
OOV can we do this ?
The OOV OOV given here is that a OOV of good OOV OOV now in Europe , which we have OOV to OOV and put together in a OOV OOV OOV we will make available to OOV one who OOV to OOV the issue in more OOV and which we have OOV with the help of the Commission .
OOV then , these OOV can now , in my opinion , be OOV and made available to OOV .
This would make it possible - and I feel that the time is now OOV - to OOV OOV OOV for OOV European policy in this OOV in OOV terms .
<SPEAKER OOV LANGUAGE="DE " NAME=" OOV > .
( OOV ) Mr President , OOV of the Commission , Mr OOV , ladies and gentlemen , I want to give high OOV to the rapporteur for his OOV in OOV a OOV OOV with his report , after we have OOV years in this House OOV OOV the right way to OOV for transport infrastructure costs .
<P> Commissioner , OOV , I hope that after the vote OOV you will OOV all the OOV for the OOV OOV on transport policy again and OOV whether they OOV the same OOV as OOV by this House .
OOV all , OOV the Commission 's proposals always take account of the Member States ' OOV , and OOV in future they will also take more account of Parliament 's OOV .
<P> I believe that the OOV report OOV an opportunity to OOV some of the OOV the various OOV have OOV so OOV of .
I also hope that we do not OOV up the subject matter of the OOV OOV with the subject of the OOV OOV .
We are about to OOV the OOV OOV ; these are both important OOV .
OOV present them to Parliament as a OOV OOV would , in my view , be extremely OOV since they are in fact OOV OOV .
<P> OOV me to make just a few OOV on the OOV report .
OOV No OOV OOV it quite clear that we want OOV transport OOV , which can be OOV on the basis of the OOV , OOV and OOV costs .
That is the first issue .
So there are two OOV of which we must not OOV OOV when we OOV these transport infrastructure OOV .
<P> OOV , we must OOV achieve a OOV market in this area .
For when you think that we still have OOV OOV of OOV because of OOV OOV and other OOV between the Member States , a whole OOV years after the OOV of the OOV market on OOV OOV OOV , then the question of OOV OOV is OOV to OOV .
<P> OOV , we really all think that after the OOV OOV in OOV OOV over the OOV year , in OOV way we want to OOV and achieve a more OOV and OOV OOV system , the OOV OOV for OOV must not OOV .
We do not want any OOV up of OOV .
<P> OOV point : in OOV to OOV costs I have two OOV .
OOV , about three years OOV , Parliament OOV in OOV to work out on a OOV basis what the OOV costs actually are .
OOV can they be OOV and how can they be OOV ?
We OOV OOV that report .
OOV , we must OOV when we OOV these OOV costs .
OOV give just one example : OOV costs .
It would be OOV to OOV an OOV for the fact that the OOV are OOV in a OOV because the Member States have not OOV the OOV , so that the OOV not only has OOV OOV and working costs but also has to OOV OOV OOV to the Member State responsible for the OOV .
<SPEAKER OOV NAME=" OOV " > Mr President , I should like to thank the rapporteur , Mr OOV , for his excellent work on what is a very difficult , OOV but important OOV .
<P> OOV , OOV , OOV , OOV OOV , OOV , OOV OOV .
OOV it the end of the world ?
OOV it is just OOV in my region .
The same problems are OOV in regions and Member States OOV the European Union .
We all have the same transport OOV and there may be common OOV to these common problems .
We must all OOV the fact , for example , that the OOV OOV OOV of OOV OOV OOV is the transport sector .
OOV OOV , OOV , must be done .
<P> However , as we all know , OOV OOV OOV OOV to do it .
That is our OOV .
I hope Mr OOV 's work , his report and the OOV we will OOV OOV will provide a framework within which we can OOV to OOV these problems .
We must OOV better OOV of our common problems and , indeed , find common OOV to them OOV the European Union , but on the basis of OOV and OOV OOV .
<P> OOV , we must OOV an OOV of OOV .
OOV OOV and regions have excellent OOV , and that OOV and information must be OOV OOV the European Union .
<P> OOV , that is my third point : Europe has a OOV role to OOV here in OOV best OOV as to how best we OOV the transport OOV .
<P> OOV and OOV , in terms of what Europe 's contribution can be within the framework of this particular initiative , I hope that OOV , local authorities and those OOV OOV and OOV can do so within a framework that is OOV and OOV at a European level , and do it together .
<P> However , I want to say that there is great concern and OOV about this particular Commission initiative and , indeed , about Mr OOV 's report , although I OOV feel that many of those concerns were fully OOV in committee where , I know , there was OOV OOV support for Mr OOV 's work .
There were concerns , for example , about OOV .
But that was more than OOV OOV when we said to the Commission : you have a OOV role to OOV in OOV to OOV this OOV together .
But , clearly , Member States and their role will be fully OOV in terms of their rights to OOV their own OOV OOV .
<P> OOV , the work we have done has already OOV and OOV OOV support .
I can OOV to a OOV from the OOV that OOV the OOV OOV OOV Europe , including , for example , the OOV and OOV , who are OOV OOV and OOV of our work , because they know that OOV Europe OOV a OOV on this issue , OOV we OOV OOV together the best of the OOV from OOV the European Union , then the OOV , OOV and OOV areas , will continue to OOV from OOV OOV of OOV and OOV .
<P> I OOV Mr OOV 's report , his work and , OOV all , his OOV to OOV us all together in a OOV common OOV of OOV to OOV the transport OOV .
<SPEAKER OOV NAME=" OOV > Mr President , Commissioner , I would like to thank the rapporteur , Mr OOV , for his most excellent work .
I would also like to say thank you for the OOV debate on the subject with some OOV OOV .
<P> I think it is important that the issue is now being OOV with by Parliament .
The main principle of the report is quite right , that OOV should OOV for the transport infrastructure and its OOV costs .
OOV for the use of the transport infrastructure must take account of the costs to society , but also the OOV principle and the need to support OOV areas .
The importance of OOV for the use of the transport infrastructure will increase as a means of OOV the situation in the future .
The system of OOV must be OOV and OOV , so that it would OOV OOV for the OOV of new OOV services .
As there are OOV , however , for a OOV of OOV and OOV , we have to take OOV that we are not OOV OOV with a system of OOV .
<P> There are still a OOV of problems OOV to a system of OOV .
OOV OOV costs with OOV will work in areas where there is a OOV of transport .
OOV OOV OOV , however , to a OOV OOV , so the same OOV for OOV cannot OOV OOV .
OOV OOV , OOV OOV and difficult OOV conditions must be taken account of when the OOV in respect of OOV are OOV , just as the report OOV .
In my opinion , it is important that we look into the possible OOV of the OOV before OOV OOV a OOV .
<SPEAKER OOV OOV " NAME=" OOV " > Mr President , Commissioner , first of all I would like to thank Mr OOV , who did , when all is said and done , put in a OOV OOV of work , having OOV by following the OOV of the OOV working group on this subject , because it is an OOV report .
OOV , we were OOV with a report that we would have OOV , at the very least , to OOV out a different OOV to the Commission , in particular .
In fact we OOV more from the Commission than the OOV OOV out by what , in a OOV , OOV of the OOV report .
<P> OOV me to OOV as OOV - it will also OOV of a certain OOV of OOV .
OOV so often , I OOV the hope that we will be OOV OOV to OOV OOV into a certain OOV and do what we have to with it .
I have already OOV for quite some time that OOV OOV would be a OOV , OOV debate and would OOV measures .
OOV I see how long it all OOV , that is when I start OOV OOV .
If I can OOV something of a OOV between the way in which the OOV on the OOV in the agricultural policy is now taking place against the OOV of the problems OOV OOV safety - in OOV , OOV a number of other countries , my own OOV - then I OOV than something OOV will OOV where the transport policy is concerned , and the environmental problems we are now OOV , OOV of the OOV OOV OOV , OOV . <P> I am also OOV at the fact that OOV OOV still OOV OOV all OOV of issues to do with our OOV OOV to OOV the OOV OOV .
We can do it for OOV all right , but not for other things .
I have a problem with this .
OOV , there is more than enough OOV for us to make OOV with this whole OOV .
I therefore hope OOV measures - of the OOV , OOV , that first OOV in Mr OOV ' s report and a number of which we quite OOV OOV - will be OOV in the OOV OOV OOV .
OOV that we OOV OOV to go OOV with them , but the OOV OOV is to OOV out a OOV to the Commission to OOV , in the OOV , to OOV , if not OOV , these measures - which will OOV a OOV OOV and so on - at European level , so as to OOV a situation where one country does take action and another does not .
OOV country will say that OOV of this is OOV OOV , OOV another will OOV get on with implementation , which is a most OOV state of OOV of course .
<P> That is why we have put a number of OOV back on the OOV and we hope that some of them make it through .
OOV from that , I wish OOV OOV at the OOV OOV .
<SPEAKER OOV LANGUAGE="FR" NAME=" OOV > Mr President , I would also like to OOV Members in OOV the OOV work that has been OOV out by the rapporteur and the Committee on OOV OOV , OOV and OOV , who have OOV many amendments .
<P> I would , however , like to come back to some points I think OOV OOV to make the report as OOV as possible .
<P> OOV of all , I feel it is OOV to point out that the main OOV is to OOV the OOV of transport , which is a OOV , OOV OOV OOV to OOV our environment and OOV OOV .
On this issue , I do not believe that it is possible to consider OOV transport on the same level as OOV transport .
The OOV is OOV OOV OOV as an economic OOV , OOV the OOV OOV OOV of OOV , a OOV OOV .
We must OOV the quality OOV OOV in the OOV of transport available .
That should then OOV us to consider the need to improve services of general interest in these OOV that are so important to the people and to the OOV .
<P> OOV , I also believe that we need to OOV priority issues .
We cannot consider rail OOV and road OOV on the same level OOV .
This means that the OOV of road use is OOV to the OOV of costs OOV by society such as environmental costs and the costs of OOV .
OOV OOV have clearly OOV this .
We must give this OOV priority in terms of Community action .
<P> OOV OOV up , with regard to OOV in OOV , I believe that this OOV of OOV should not further increase costs , particularly those OOV by OOV .
OOV infrastructure OOV system , like the one OOV in my group ' s OOV , should improve the services of general interest , which some transport services provide , in order to OOV all citizens OOV OOV to OOV , OOV and OOV services .
<SPEAKER OOV OOV " OOV OOV " > Mr President , Commissioner , it may be common OOV that our group is not OOV of the need for all the current OOV .
However , these go OOV in the OOV of the European transport policy .
OOV this OOV problem OOV a OOV OOV .
That is something we are all agreed on in this House .
<P> That is why I am OOV that opinion is so OOV on this .
OOV all , we have agreed that we must OOV for a OOV transport policy , which OOV for OOV both now and in the future .
<P> OOV from this OOV , it is necessary for OOV of different OOV of transport to OOV the OOV for the costs they OOV , in order , in this way , to be able to OOV the OOV OOV or OOV it from OOV .
This concerns both the OOV costs of the infrastructure and the OOV costs , which are less OOV to OOV and OOV .
<P> In the present resolution , the OOV is very much on the OOV costs , which can be OOV very OOV at this OOV .
OOV these costs form a OOV part of the OOV costs OOV , it is OOV to OOV that this means the OOV costs are OOV .
The OOV of OOV OOV OOV the OOV of a particular OOV OOV is not a OOV reason for OOV this OOV from the OOV to be OOV .
I can fully OOV with Mr OOV s amendments on this point , as I could with his contribution .
<P> I would agree with those of you who have OOV , that OOV on all costs OOV must not OOV transport OOV with such OOV OOV as will put their OOV at OOV .
In order to OOV this , however , we must not OOV to OOV transport OOV as OOV as possible , OOV OOV the costs to be OOV on as OOV as possible , but what we must do OOV is OOV the transport OOV legal support with a view to OOV the costs OOV OOV the group that should by rights OOV the OOV , OOV the OOV .
<P> Finally , I would point out that the OOV situation from the OOV OOV is when there is a level OOV field for all transport OOV .
However , that must not be our OOV point of OOV .
In our efforts to OOV OOV OOV , we must OOV OOV on those OOV of transport which do society and the environment the least OOV .
OOV the development of such OOV of transport may not be OOV from the OOV OOV but is OOV OOV , also OOV , given the OOV to be OOV .
<P> You will OOV that I am OOV to vote in favour of the present resolution as it OOV .
<SPEAKER OOV OOV " NAME=" OOV > Mr President , Commissioner , I too would like to start by OOV the rapporteur both for the OOV OOV of work he has done and also , in particular , for his OOV to OOV the OOV , amendments and proposals of all the OOV of the committee , to the point that I feel this report can be said to be a OOV OOV report OOV by the committee as a whole .
OOV , the current situation is clear - the OOV OOV and the OOV OOV OOV it OOV : there is a great problem because of the environmental and social costs we have to OOV and because of the OOV on OOV trade that the OOV in OOV and OOV systems in our countries OOV upon their economic systems .
<P> OOV this report , therefore , we have OOV a possible situation , a road to take , and it is now up to the Commission to take it .
I OOV the OOV that we all OOV : greater OOV with regard to use in the OOV of costs , OOV to social costs , but also OOV of OOV OOV areas and OOV of the OOV , OOV " to environmental OOV but , at the same time , OOV of the right to OOV as a OOV right .
<P> The only OOV I would OOV to make , Commissioner , is that all this is good , particularly the OOV to the OOV OOV " principle , but with the OOV that we cannot OOV this principle to OOV the citizens or OOV .
OOV to the OOV OOV " principle means OOV into the OOV of OOV a OOV for which a OOV is set , and we must therefore OOV the citizens and OOV what they want and what they are OOV to OOV for : OOV quality .
OOV in the OOV of transport , in my opinion , means OOV all safety , OOV and OOV of OOV .
If we can provide this , then , at the same time , we will have OOV our present OOV and set the OOV in OOV for a new OOV for the future .
<SPEAKER OOV LANGUAGE="FR" NAME=" OOV " > Mr President , I would like to OOV to the OOV for Mr OOV , the rapporteur , because this is an extremely difficult subject and there are very OOV OOV .
OOV , he has had many amendments to work through .
OOV all is said and done , I believe that the OOV OOV is clear and OOV - no OOV OOV .
I think that this contribution by the European Parliament will OOV the Commission to make good progress in its OOV work .
<P> The issue of infrastructure OOV is OOV one of the most difficult for the general public to OOV , but it is OOV also the OOV to OOV our OOV of a OOV OOV of OOV , given that the number of people OOV and the OOV of OOV OOV within the Union is OOV to increase OOV .
OOV , we know that road OOV OOV the most OOV but that it is also OOV in terms of both infrastructure OOV , which is often OOV by the OOV , and in terms of its use .
OOV , if we really wish to OOV without OOV so much OOV to the environment , we will certainly need to OOV OOV ; that is , how the various OOV of transport OOV the real OOV of costs .
<P> OOV the same , I believe that we must be very aware that the rail system is not and will not for many years be in a position to OOV to a great OOV with road transport , in particular in terms of OOV transport or OOV transport OOV , which are OOV OOV .
There are still OOV infrastructure costs and infrastructure and OOV needs , and rail OOV ' OOV do not provide enough to OOV them .
OOV to road OOV , those on the OOV are still too high with a OOV OOV on OOV costs .
<P> The issue of OOV is therefore OOV OOV to this matter and if we really wish to improve transport we need to be in a position to OOV OOV the OOV costs of transport ; as mentioned ; in other words , so that road transport actually OOV for all the costs it OOV , as does rail transport , and so that the OOV OOV OOV OOV this OOV OOV costs .
<P> We should not , however , OOV our OOV to one political OOV OOV in all this .
The political OOV OOV is that our OOV citizens want to OOV .
They believe that they have the right to OOV of OOV , something I think we should OOV in OOV , and very often they do not OOV OOV transport and the OOV OOV .
This was OOV last OOV .
<P> OOV , on a political level , we must take a OOV approach , which should be both OOV and OOV .
A OOV approach means that we cannot OOV OOV costs on road OOV OOV the OOV is in a position to take over from it , and for the time being the OOV is not in any such position .
A OOV approach is OOV , because I believe that we have to OOV between OOV transport and OOV transport and that we may also have to OOV OOV OOV on OOV OOV OOV , if we really wish to improve OOV in regions like OOV , that OOV as OOV .
<SPEAKER OOV OOV " > Mr President , we must make it very clear that this is not about the EU OOV OOV or OOV a new OOV over and OOV the OOV national OOV .
It is an OOV to find a common set of OOV , of OOV OOV for the transport infrastructure , and OOV OOV OOV OOV the OOV
<P> However , it is up to the Member States to set and OOV OOV , OOV in a common framework .
At present , OOV is not OOV for transport infrastructure .
OOV often , I know in the OOV it is used for OOV government OOV .
I am OOV it is the same in other EU Member States .
OOV costs should be OOV by the OOV , but OOV should not OOV OOV OOV if there is no public transport , and this report OOV that very clear .
<P> This report is about a level OOV field : not to OOV more but to OOV more OOV .
OOV in the OOV OOV that they are at a OOV OOV , and that is OOV .
OOV OOV OOV do not OOV OOV road OOV .
OOV EU countries ' OOV is OOV OOV OOV OOV OOV .
The same OOV to OOV OOV : it is three OOV more OOV in the OOV
That OOV to OOV of OOV OOV the OOV
OOV of the OOV OOV OOV this report , they should welcome it because it will do a OOV to help our OOV OOV .
<SPEAKER OOV OOV " NAME=" OOV " > Mr President , I have not yet OOV the point that a number of people OOV I have OOV OOV this OOV have OOV .
As OOV OOV , infrastructure OOV are made in OOV and other transport OOV , for example .
OOV OOV OOV how much is OOV .
On the other hand , the state OOV OOV from transport , such as road OOV .
OOV OOV OOV how much this OOV to , but one OOV we do know is that it is not OOV OOV in OOV and other OOV of infrastructure .
<P> This report OOV the OOV between OOV and OOV ; OOV costs such as environmental and OOV costs are also taken into account .
OOV people also want to OOV the OOV of OOV OOV from those who get OOV in them , OOV to the OOV OOV ' principle .
I think this is an excellent principle and I would like to see it OOV in full , but not to OOV OOV .
OOV OOV are OOV of OOV government policy on the infrastructure OOV , which is why the government itself , certainly in the OOV , must be OOV as the OOV .
<P> This report OOV about OOV the OOV of social costs between the different OOV of transport .
OOV us take a OOV to consider the OOV in this OOV .
OOV transport always OOV to OOV far more OOV than rail transport .
OOV OOV , this OOV not to be the case .
OOV the question is : what are we actually OOV to achieve by making social costs OOV in this way ?
OOV we really want an OOV , OOV OOV of the costs of the transport OOV , or , if certain results do not OOV with our OOV , for example if rail transport OOV OOV OOV as a result , will we end up making a political OOV ?
We want people to OOV by OOV and so it must be made more OOV .
That is OOV by me , but not by OOV this OOV .
We are not going to OOV OOV and road transport OOV first on the basis of the OOV OOV , and then OOV the OOV .
OOV and OOV OOV already OOV far more than their OOV in terms of social costs .
So OOV we OOV OOV about the OOV , so that OOV OOV what they can be for or against , or we OOV a OOV and OOV system with OOV for the OOV , people who OOV in OOV areas and have no OOV , and the OOV position of the Union .
<P> Commissioner , I must say , this is a OOV ' s OOV you have OOV OOV into .
OOV should a system of this OOV only be OOV to the transport sector ?
OOV should it not be OOV to OOV OOV , OOV , OOV OOV , OOV , OOV OOV and OOV OOV too ? <SPEAKER OOV LANGUAGE="ES " OOV OOV " > Mr President , I would also like to OOV the rapporteur , Mr OOV , but I would like to point out that he OOV OOV not for his OOV OOV to OOV OOV , but for having OOV certain OOV in the report which OOV us all to be OOV .
<P> I would like to OOV two of these OOV , the OOV which OOV me to support the OOV of his proposals .
The first is that the report , " OOV that such OOV needs a OOV and OOV implementation OOV on OOV and OOV information . "
<P> The second OOV which OOV me to OOV this report is the OOV issue , because , OOV , Mr OOV ' s report OOV it OOV clear - he has said this with OOV OOV - that there is going to be an increase in the OOV for OOV , as the OOV of OOV by the States is going to be OOV on to OOV .
We cannot OOV that fact .
We therefore need this OOV implementation , which OOV to me to be OOV OOV because , when we OOV of OOV in OOV to OOV and OOV costs , in the OOV OOV of the OOV , which is OOV difficult to OOV , we are OOV about an increase in OOV for the OOV .
<P> OOV , in fact , we are OOV about OOV rail transport .
I believe that this is one of the OOV which OOV the OOV of OOV .
The fact is that road transport - OOV - have a clear and very serious environmental OOV , so much so that they OOV are OOV , and therefore OOV , what all the other OOV OOV are OOV in terms of OOV OOV .
<P> The time has therefore come to OOV the OOV .
OOV OOV to be OOV of an OOV , but we must OOV it .
On the one hand , by means of OOV , OOV at OOV OOV .
On the other hand , however , we must also OOV OOV .
It is clear that these OOV are going to OOV an increase in the OOV to OOV so that they might consider the OOV of OOV public transport and the OOV of making more OOV use of the OOV - both for OOV and for OOV transport .
I believe that this is the OOV OOV , which OOV OOV the Commission and Mr OOV ' s OOV OOV of OOV .
That is why we are going to support OOV but , of course , this OOV implementation OOV to me to be OOV to the OOV being able to OOV and take this process on OOV .
<SPEAKER OOV OOV " NAME=" OOV OOV " > Mr President , Commissioner , first of all I would like to OOV Mr OOV on his OOV of this difficult OOV .
It is an OOV subject and the fact that there are OOV amendments OOV how OOV opinion is , but at least it has OOV to a more OOV position .
<P> OOV OOV , I would , in OOV , agree with the report that we need to have a more OOV OOV of the OOV social costs of transport .
However , in OOV , it would OOV that such measures would be OOV by OOV and OOV OOV .
That is why a great deal more OOV will need to be done before the OOV can be OOV OOV .
I do not see OOV to OOV with Mr OOV on that OOV .
<P> OOV of the OOV OOV is that the OOV to OOV will OOV by a OOV small OOV , OOV OOV to OOV % .
This OOV with the OOV % OOV in the OOV to rail , and the OOV % OOV in the OOV to OOV OOV .
The OOV OOV OOV will come under OOV again then .
<P> OOV second concern is that the OOV to transport will OOV by a OOV OOV .
That would be to the OOV of Europe ' s economic position .
Finally , I do not go OOV with the rapporteur ' s proposal to OOV from the OOV OOV ' principle , in that he OOV to OOV OOV OOV to OOV regions , for example .
OOV we must consider in real terms whether this would OOV to OOV of OOV and an increase in the OOV costs .
I am against OOV for the same reason .
<SPEAKER OOV LANGUAGE="DE " NAME=" OOV " > Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , OOV to the OOV report the OOV about a common framework for OOV transport infrastructure OOV has OOV going again .
If we want a OOV market that OOV , we need a transport system that OOV , in which the conditions of OOV are OOV or at least OOV for all those involved in transport .
The OOV OOV of transport infrastructure OOV is the most important OOV towards that .
<P> The way we agree to OOV costs is certainly important to the OOV , OOV and new development of infrastructure whether full costs or OOV costs , social OOV costs or social OOV costs .
But OOV more important in terms of OOV OOV in OOV is that we OOV agreement , and do so as OOV as possible .
OOV we must OOV one OOV .
If we want to see OOV OOV between the various transport OOV too then we need to go on OOV the implementation of the OOV costs .
OOV OOV that OOV also means OOV the OOV of the various OOV of transport and is therefore no more than OOV , or a policy of OOV for the OOV OOV .
I will OOV out the question of who is OOV OOV OOV in this House with Mr OOV OOV ; at present I only have two OOV ' OOV time .
<P> For OOV OOV transport we OOV need a OOV , OOV OOV OOV OOV ; here we could also OOV OOV the OOV OOV OOV .
OOV transport OOV are themselves OOV it that way now .
OOV if we OOV transport costs on the OOV OOV " principle can we OOV a OOV OOV to OOV the OOV OOV in OOV transport , for we all know about the next OOV in OOV transport costs : OOV costs as a result of enlargement OOV , of OOV , and that is on OOV of the OOV of increase we have OOV up to now .
<SPEAKER OOV LANGUAGE="ES " NAME=" OOV OOV > Mr President , I would OOV like to thank Mr OOV for his OOV report and all the OOV for OOV in this debate .
I am OOV to be able to say that the Commission has OOV the report and its OOV with great OOV .
I am aware of the great OOV of work and the OOV OOV that the rapporteur , Mr OOV , has put in to OOV to achieve the OOV possible OOV , and for which he has been OOV by Mr OOV and other OOV .
I would like to say that , with regard to such a OOV and OOV issue as OOV for OOV , it is a great OOV - and I OOV this - to have OOV OOV the OOV , because it is really difficult to OOV a OOV on a proposal such as this .
<P> This report is OOV on a OOV of OOV with the OOV of the Commission ' s own high level group on OOV for OOV and on an information OOV on best OOV in OOV for OOV .
OOV this I OOV that this is a OOV , OOV and OOV OOV and we OOV that OOV to Mr OOV and to the other OOV who have OOV their great interest in such a OOV and difficult issue .
The report is therefore OOV and OOV a OOV contribution to the OOV of the policy of OOV for OOV as well as its OOV , a OOV issue in the OOV of transport policy and in making progress with a policy which OOV OOV transport and OOV for the future and in OOV in a OOV way with the OOV OOV to which we are going to have to find a OOV in the years to come .
<P> The report also OOV with the Commission ' s policy on OOV for transport OOV .
The Commission OOV that the OOV of OOV in OOV OOV , the OOV of OOV in Member States ' OOV , OOV the OOV of transport OOV and OOV the development of the OOV market and economic OOV .
OOV the OOV of the different means of transport , it OOV real costs on European OOV and on society in general .
<P> OOV , the Commission has OOV the OOV implementation - and I am OOV that Mr OOV has OOV , because he has not OOV that not only has Mr OOV OOV that OOV , but that the Commission is OOV that he has - of a OOV framework for OOV for OOV in the European Union which is OOV to all means of transport .
The Commission ' s policy of OOV for OOV OOV a framework for the OOV of OOV and OOV on transport , with a view to OOV environmental costs , infrastructure costs and the OOV of OOV OOV for transport .
<P> OOV has been made , as in the case of the OOV in OOV of the measures on OOV OOV through the OOV OOV .
A great deal , however , OOV to be done .
I am therefore OOV to be able to OOV Parliament that the concerns OOV in the report in OOV to OOV for OOV will be taken fully into account in the next Commission OOV OOV on the common transport policy , which I OOV to OOV and which , although OOV OOV than the OOV OOV OOV , will OOV us to make progress in OOV one the most OOV problems of that transport policy : OOV for OOV .
OOV of that will be possible OOV to the OOV work of the Members of this Parliament and Mr OOV in particular .
<SPEAKER OOV NAME=" President " > OOV you very much , Mrs OOV OOV .
<P> The debate is OOV .
<P> The vote will take place OOV at OOV OOV .
<P> ( The OOV was OOV at OOV OOV ){"name": "ep-01-01-18.txt"}žúOOV OOV OOV of the OOV of the OOV OOV <SPEAKER OOV NAME=" President " > OOV ' s OOV have been OOV .
<P> OOV there any OOV ?
<SPEAKER OOV LANGUAGE="DE " NAME=" OOV " > Mr President , I must OOV , because this is not a OOV on OOV 's OOV , but on the OOV from the OOV before OOV .
OOV , I OOV too OOV that my OOV was not on the OOV OOV .
However , I was here the OOV OOV and OOV part in all the OOV OOV and other OOV .
I would be OOV if this could therefore be OOV .
<SPEAKER OOV NAME=" President " > Mr OOV , of course the OOV will be OOV to OOV the OOV situation .
<SPEAKER OOV OOV " NAME=" OOV " > Mr President , Mrs OOV is not present in the OOV .
OOV is OOV a OOV meeting of our group .
But I OOV that OOV is not OOV on OOV ' s OOV OOV .
OOV was quite OOV there .
OOV OOV in the debate on the Swedish Presidency .
I would ask you to OOV the OOV OOV OOV .
<SPEAKER OOV NAME=" President " > That will certainly be done , Mr OOV .
<P> ( Parliament adopted the OOV ) <SPEAKER OOV LANGUAGE="FR" NAME=" OOV " > Mr President , on OOV OOV , Parliament OOV that the Committee on OOV and OOV OOV should look into the situation of the workers of the European OOV , OOV , OOV with the OOV of OOV OOV in the OOV sector , OOV of which are in OOV .
We do not know when the committee is going to OOV to OOV this matter and it is very OOV as the European OOV of OOV is going to OOV OOV .
<P> OOV , the workers of this OOV , in OOV at least , are on OOV .
I would like to OOV your OOV on the subject of this OOV and , in the OOV , on behalf of OOV and my OOV OOV OOV , I would like to OOV OOV with these workers .
It is OOV that a OOV OOV OOV should be able to OOV OOV of workers OOV Europe into OOV and OOV .
<SPEAKER OOV NAME=" President " > Mrs OOV , I would OOV that , given the importance and the OOV of the matter , you OOV to the OOV of the Committee on OOV and OOV OOV , Mr OOV .
<SPEAKER OOV OOV NAME=" OOV " > Mr President , I OOV if you have OOV the OOV report in today 's OOV of OOV OOV .
It OOV an OOV with a OOV OOV under the OOV ' OOV OOV : OOV OOV OOV OOV OOV OOV . '
The OOV OOV to the OOV OOV OOV .
The OOV OOV on the OOV OOV of today 's OOV OOV and OOV that the OOV OOV is OOV OOV OOV on OOV and OOV if its OOV , which OOV the OOV of OOV , are not OOV .
The OOV OOV that it has OOV the OOV in order to OOV OOV public opinion to the OOV OOV OOV it and it also OOV , by way of information , that OOV measures have been taken in OOV in order to deal with this OOV OOV .
It OOV OOV about OOV .
I should like to OOV the OOV 's attention to this major issue and ask if it OOV OOV about this and if it has made OOV to the authorities in OOV for OOV measures to be taken to OOV Parliament because it OOV to me that OOV who so OOV can OOV the Parliament OOV and I OOV that we may have to deal with OOV OOV and OOV OOV .
<SPEAKER OOV NAME=" President " > Mr OOV , I wish to say , first of all , that I am OOV for your information , or at least for the fact that you have OOV it with us .
There is a OOV in Parliament , which I think is OOV by all Members , that the authorities OOV this OOV take account of and give great priority to the issue of security .
I therefore feel that OOV necessary is OOV being done or being OOV in order to OOV the OOV OOV of this OOV in OOV or in OOV in the most OOV conditions possible .
In any OOV , thank you for your information .
<SPEAKER OOV LANGUAGE="DE " NAME=" OOV , OOV " > Mr President , as rapporteur in the Committee on OOV OOV , OOV Rights , OOV OOV and OOV OOV on OOV for the OOV of the OOV OOV , I have a OOV to make of you .
It has come to our attention that a OOV of the OOV Parliament , Mr OOV OOV , has been OOV in OOV .
OOV has OOV been OOV of OOV .
The OOV is that he OOV civil rights OOV and that his OOV were quite OOV for a OOV of a OOV OOV OOV .
<P> Mr President , I OOV you to OOV for a OOV to be made to the OOV authorities for Mr OOV and those OOV OOV to be OOV OOV , because the OOV OOV does not have any OOV OOV for OOV OOV in democracy to OOV of a OOV OOV OOV .
I have all the more reason for OOV you this given that in OOV this year a meeting of the OOV Union is OOV to take place in OOV .
OOV can one OOV OOV OOV a meeting of this OOV in a country where OOV of OOV are OOV if they OOV to civil rights OOV ?
<SPEAKER OOV NAME=" President " > OOV you very much , Mr OOV , I shall OOV your information and your concern - which , I think we all OOV - to Mrs OOV , the President of this Parliament , who will certainly state Parliament ' s position on this issue .
<SPEAKER OOV LANGUAGE="DE " NAME=" OOV > Mr President , I OOV to OOV that the OOV of OOV against this House be taken OOV and that the OOV OOV up a plan to actually OOV the safety of this House .
<SPEAKER OOV NAME=" President " > I shall OOV what I said a few OOV OOV : I believe that Parliament OOV security issues extremely OOV , and we all feel that the OOV in which we work and the OOV of Parliament itself make it a OOV .
The OOV authorities are therefore very OOV to this issue and to OOV at measures to improve the situation so that we can work OOV and in peace .
<SPEAKER OOV OOV OOV " > Mr President , also on the question of the security of the House , you will OOV that on OOV OOV 2000 , the OOV OOV OOV OOV the Committee on OOV OOV , OOV Rights , OOV OOV and OOV OOV of this House and he was OOV by OOV .
<P> This was a OOV for great concern .
At the time , we OOV the attention of the President to this matter and OOV OOV OOV would look into it and find out what the OOV were , how the OOV had OOV into Parliament , and take appropriate OOV to ensure that such things did not OOV again .
<P> In the OOV of what we have been OOV , the security of this House , I OOV if you would OOV this up and see what OOV have been taken to improve security and report on that particular OOV last OOV .
<SPEAKER OOV NAME=" President " > Mr OOV OOV , the President of Parliament and the OOV fully OOV your OOV and you will OOV have a OOV to the important issue that you have OOV .
OOV OOV OOV OOV of women and OOV in the OOV process <SPEAKER OOV NAME=" President " > The next OOV is the report ( OOV ) by Mrs OOV , on behalf of the Committee on OOV s Rights and OOV OOV , on a report from the Commission to the Council , the European Parliament and the OOV and OOV Committee on the implementation of Council OOV OOV of OOV OOV OOV on the OOV OOV of women and OOV in the OOV process OOV ) OOV - OOV - OOV .
<SPEAKER OOV OOV OOV > Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , as you all know , respect for the human rights and OOV OOV of women is a very recent OOV .
<P> It was not OOV the OOV OOV that women OOV the right to OOV education , the OOV , the OOV and OOV employment and that they were OOV OOV as OOV with political rights .
The OOV OOV OOV with women OOV for the right to vote .
<P> At the start of the OOV OOV , the OOV of OOV the OOV on the OOV OOV OOV OOV a OOV OOV of OOV and OOV between the OOV in all OOV of economic , social , OOV and political life .
<P> The need for women to be OOV in the OOV process and for a OOV OOV of women and OOV in the OOV OOV , OOV the OOV of the OOV in OOV , is a OOV OOV OOV of democracy and peace and of the OOV and OOV of the European Union .
<P> In OOV to this need and on the basis of OOV proposals by the European OOV of OOV which made up the Commission in OOV , the Council adopted an important OOV to the Member States on the OOV OOV of OOV and women in the OOV process in OOV OOV .
We can see from the OOV OOV by the Member States that OOV progress has been made over the last three years and that there are OOV OOV between the Member States .
The most OOV results are in countries which have a long OOV of OOV OOV of the OOV , such as OOV and OOV , where the OOV of women in OOV and government is over OOV % .
OOV , as you all know , has a OOV of OOV OOV and OOV OOV OOV .
OOV of course , at the other end of the OOV , there are countries such as OOV and OOV , where the OOV of women is OOV or OOV OOV % . <P> The problem OOV OOV to the OOV rather than the OOV OOV of OOV , where the real decisions are taken , where the real OOV is OOV , where the future of the European Union is OOV and OOV .
OOV , OOV measures are OOV if the problems and OOV OOV from OOV OOV between the OOV are to be OOV .
We need a new OOV and social framework which OOV all the OOV that have taken place since , which OOV OOV OOV and OOV OOV OOV and OOV between the two OOV , so that any decisions taken OOV the OOV , OOV , OOV , interests and OOV of both OOV of the human OOV .
<P> OOV that women are fully involved in the OOV process and OOV OOV at European OOV , there is no OOV to OOV them from OOV and OOV OOV , OOV is it right that women should OOV the OOV of OOV OOV and OOV OOV .
OOV to OOV and OOV , OOV and women working and taking decisions together , a OOV between the OOV and OOV , could result in a more OOV and OOV world .
This OOV must not , of course , OOV OOV OOV % for each OOV , which is OOV an OOV OOV , especially in OOV , where it has been OOV for years now .
<P> What is certain is that , once there is a OOV OOV of women in the OOV process , priority issues OOV to the quality of life , such as environmental OOV , social policy and OOV , OOV OOV , education , the OOV against OOV and OOV in human OOV and the OOV resolution of OOV will OOV on the political OOV .
If we are to OOV in this OOV , OOV OOV . if we are to achieve a OOV OOV of the OOV , we need to OOV specific OOV and measures , such as OOV the OOV political OOV and the OOV for OOV OOV .
The legislation on public OOV for political parties should make OOV for greater OOV for parties which OOV a OOV OOV within the OOV and for OOV for parties which have too few women , as was OOV OOV in OOV .
OOV , especially in countries in which the OOV of women is OOV OOV % , should consider how to OOV and OOV their OOV systems .
OOV , if OOV OOV are to be OOV , they must be OOV with other measures OOV to political parties and the OOV of the OOV system .
We also need to OOV OOV by OOV the role of the OOV from an OOV OOV and to OOV women 's OOV to OOV high OOV .
We need to OOV the social infrastructure in order to OOV for and support OOV citizens and , OOV , the Member States need to take part in the next OOV OOV to OOV the Treaty so that there is a OOV legal basis which will OOV a OOV OOV of the two OOV in the OOV of the European Union , so that we can OOV do the OOV and ensure that the OOV OOV of the OOV is also OOV in the OOV of OOV and that any decisions taken on the future of Europe are not taken in the OOV of women .
<SPEAKER OOV LANGUAGE="DE " NAME=" OOV , OOV " > Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , how can we OOV to OOV a OOV between OOV and women in their working life , both in the OOV sector and in public OOV , and both at European and national level ?
We need an OOV OOV OOV to positive measures .
We need to OOV OOV and OOV OOV about OOV OOV .
OOV role OOV should be those OOV women who very OOV OOV OOV OOV and who OOV OOV in the OOV .
However , they , and this OOV OOV to OOV , have to be able to OOV their OOV OOV just as well as they OOV with the OOV OOV OOV on them .
<P> On behalf of the Group of the European OOV 's OOV ( OOV OOV ) and European OOV , I would like to OOV Mrs OOV on OOV report , which OOV many important OOV , such as the OOV for the role of women to be OOV or for action to be taken to OOV women 's OOV OOV in management and OOV OOV within OOV and also , I have to say , in trade OOV .
The OOV of OOV OOV in the OOV market needs to be OOV by OOV OOV OOV on .
We also support the call for OOV OOV in order to OOV OOV OOV of OOV and OOV .
We are in favour of cooperation between the two OOV and therefore want to see women 's concerns , OOV and OOV making a contribution .
They really do OOV a OOV ' s world .
<P> However , on some points there is not a OOV OOV the Members of the OOV Group in the Committee on OOV 's Rights and OOV OOV .
That is why one OOV OOV for the report and the other OOV against - now that is OOV .
The main concerns are OOV in the OOV amendments which I have OOV OOV with OOV OOV .
Mrs OOV has already agreed to one of them : OOV and OOV are no OOV to be OOV as a OOV OOV which women have to OOV , but rather as a OOV OOV which they have to OOV with and which they can indeed OOV with in OOV .
<P> OOV OOV OOV the OOV that women need to be OOV in areas like public OOV and OOV if they are to get on in the world .
For one OOV , OOV also have OOV in these areas and , what is more , these OOV many women do not OOV to be given financial support to do this .
They are OOV it themselves and have been OOV so for a long time .
<P> However , the two most important amendments are about OOV the OOV of OOV .
We know that there are various systems in the Member States .
OOV have OOV OOV of one OOV or another .
OOV want a OOV of OOV system , OOV OOV and women , and OOV OOV that the parties have to OOV OOV if an OOV OOV of women is not OOV in their OOV .
The principle of OOV should come into OOV here .
OOV it is not right for OOV measures in Member States to be OOV by Europe through the back OOV .
<P> OOV , OOV are OOV upon to OOV the OOV OOV of OOV OOV systems .
That is not a OOV for OOV - it is a OOV for the parties .
They should look at this and OOV up their OOV OOV OOV with this in OOV .
It is their OOV and not one for OOV .
We regard these amendments as so important that we have OOV a OOV vote .
If you could give us your support on this , Mrs OOV , your report could well OOV an OOV OOV .
<P> OOV OOV concerned about OOV OOV needs to make OOV not only that the OOV OOV are right , but that the OOV is right too .
The more OOV we OOV this , the greater its OOV will be , especially OOV those who do not have OOV OOV in this field , and that will make it all the more OOV that we will OOV a OOV OOV today .
<SPEAKER OOV LANGUAGE="DE " NAME=" OOV " > Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , the policy of the Group of the OOV of European OOV is for every OOV OOV of the EU to have OOV to OOV OOV at local , regional , national and European level .
OOV OOV for women in political and social decision making is not only our OOV right , but a social OOV .
We do not just OOV a OOV ' s world ; we are OOV in all areas of this OOV OOV world .
<P> As the new OOV OOV , we are OOV to OOV OOV our OOV Mrs OOV , who I would like to thank OOV for OOV OOV and OOV work , in order to OOV OOV to the OOV of OOV in the OOV of OOV between OOV and women .
It has been a long OOV from the first women 's OOV , in OOV in OOV , to OOV political OOV in OOV , and we still have a long way to go before we can take women OOV , OOV , OOV and OOV OOV for OOV as a part of OOV life .
<P> The European Union has made OOV progress in this regard .
We have now been able to increase the OOV of women in the European Parliament to OOV % , and it is , OOV , OOV OOV in the OOV OOV than in the OOV and more OOV OOV .
OOV % of the Commission is made up of women , and the OOV is OOV % in the OOV of the Member States and OOV % in national OOV .
I am OOV to OOV OOV OOV from my own country .
OOV the last government OOV in OOV , women now make up OOV % of the OOV OOV Government , and this has been OOV by my OOV , by my political OOV .
<P> We are therefore OOV about our own role and can OOV as a OOV OOV for OOV rights and the OOV OOV from the OOV report .
I must call upon the House to support the rapporteur , Mrs OOV , as OOV the three issues just OOV by Mr OOV , and OOV to the OOV OOV OOV by the committee .
It would be a OOV to OOV OOV , as the parties are being OOV to do .
OOV , we also OOV OOV as OOV in the report to the OOV OOV on OOV in OOV .
The right OOV is to OOV all OOV open .
<SPEAKER OOV OOV OOV " > Mr President , I should first of all like to thank Mrs OOV for a really OOV report .
I think it is OOV in the way it is OOV .
The report clearly OOV the OOV OOV between the Member States , but there is one OOV all the countries have in common : there is no OOV , including in those countries which are OOV OOV the road , and here I am OOV , for example , of the OOV countries .
In OOV , we have made a OOV of progress at OOV level , both on the back and the OOV OOV .
OOV OOV and OOV are mentioned , and OOV is OOV in an OOV .
I should therefore like to say a OOV of things about OOV .
I want to OOV that OOV of the OOV OOV in the OOV government are women and that both the OOV of OOV OOV and the OOV of OOV are women .
OOV own OOV has OOV OOV OOV at the OOV and one OOV OOV , OOV a OOV OOV of the OOV OOV and a OOV OOV OOV , and I am the only OOV OOV to the European Parliament .
We have OOV OOV OOV in for OOV systems for , if that were the case , I believe that OOV would have OOV to take OOV of the fact .
<P> In the OOV countries too , however , there are very few women in management OOV , particularly at the OOV level .
OOV has OOV to OOV about , and OOV has OOV , as far as I can see .
As was OOV out OOV , the Swedish OOV OOV ' s OOV OOV only of OOV .
We clearly have a problem , therefore .
I OOV believe that this has to do with the OOV made of women in the OOV system .
But that is , of course , something we can OOV .
OOV and OOV will OOV in two different OOV .
OOV , OOV has a OOV OOV , and that is to women ' s OOV .
OOV has a OOV OOV , which is to the OOV of women who OOV OOV out in the OOV system .
In OOV , I want to say that my most important OOV is that cooperation at European level can be extremely OOV to us , but we must OOV that the different countries OOV very different problems , and quite different OOV are therefore OOV .
We must OOV between those things from which we can all OOV in the Community , for example OOV that can be OOV , and those areas in which we can clearly only OOV each other OOV .
That OOV will be of no less OOV importance in OOV with enlargement .
OOV , we are concerned with countries which may well have the legislation in place , but not the OOV OOV , and OOV aid on our part is really OOV in this area .
<P> <SPEAKER OOV NAME=" OOV , OOV " > Mr President , I wish to OOV Mrs OOV on a very good and OOV report .
OOV of its main OOV is the need for an OOV OOV .
If we are to OOV the very serious OOV of OOV of OOV and women , not only in the political OOV but also in OOV at all OOV in society , this is OOV .
<P> We should OOV that just last year the OOV presidency OOV at OOV OOV in the Member States , including national , regional and local OOV , the civil OOV and the OOV OOV .
OOV it OOV it OOV women were OOV .
The problems have been OOV for a long time , but progress on OOV them has been OOV .
<P> We OOV OOV OOV in these reports , OOV for better OOV and OOV , OOV OOV to OOV more women into OOV in the same way as they have already very often become OOV OOV in their own OOV and local OOV , and for measures to make it OOV for OOV and to women to OOV work and OOV life .
<P> We have to OOV on OOV these things because they are OOV .
But , in OOV , we need positive action , such as OOV , to make a real OOV .
<P> This report does not OOV what should be done in OOV Member States , but OOV upon the OOV to look at their own situation and take action to improve the OOV of women and OOV , OOV OOV means , if necessary , as some have already done .
<P> OOV these measures have been used , they have been OOV , not only in OOV more women OOV to Parliament but also in OOV OOV , OOV good role OOV for other women - OOV in particular - and OOV debate and OOV all OOV .
So the Group of the OOV OOV OOV will support all the OOV of the report because it will OOV towards OOV OOV and real democracy .
<SPEAKER OOV LANGUAGE="SV" OOV " > Mr President , in the Swedish OOV of OOV s OOV , the OOV under the OOV OOV OOV as OOV : <P> ' A social system OOV on OOV relations between OOV , OOV so that the OOV OOV are OOV from the OOV down and so that women as a OOV are OOV in a OOV position .
The OOV OOV is OOV by a system of OOV OOV by OOV OOV and OOV on OOV ' s OOV of OOV .
<P> The OOV basis of this system OOV of a OOV of OOV OOV to OOV which , at all OOV of the OOV , OOV to women the OOV which are OOV OOV or more OOV OOV .
OOV of the OOV of this is OOV of women ' s OOV and OOV .
This OOV in OOV OOV OOV OOV against women , on the one hand , and that women OOV OOV , on the other . ' <P> I would like to come back OOV to the question of how we OOV OOV .
OOV all , it is not just in this OOV - it also OOV OOV the various OOV of society - that OOV of the Group of the European OOV ' s OOV OOV the OOV of OOV and , for some reason I cannot OOV , have a OOV OOV of OOV OOV OOV to OOV .
It is said that women must be OOV on OOV , but I should like to ask the question which , more often than not , OOV and OOV OOV OOV OOV OOV to ask : What OOV are we actually OOV for ?
OOV all , we know that , to a OOV OOV , women and OOV are at present OOV OOV in society as a whole .
<P> We in the OOV Group of the European United OOV OOV OOV have no problem OOV with OOV Mrs OOV ' s report one OOV OOV OOV - on the OOV .
We are OOV for what is OOV the OOV OOV ' .
We have now been OOV for OOV years , so we do not want to OOV even another two years for something to OOV .
<SPEAKER OOV OOV " NAME=" OOV > Mrs OOV , I think that the OOV level of OOV of women and , indeed , young people in our OOV is the result of a OOV OOV , not a OOV .
OOV OOV OOV OOV up OOV by the parties - as OOV in your report - where it is not even possible to OOV a OOV vote , OOV the best system for OOV OOV OOV of parties , or rather OOV OOV and OOV OOV by parties , be they women or OOV , in our OOV .
On the OOV , I think the OOV progress in OOV of women and young people in our OOV is actually OOV to OOV systems which OOV OOV OOV against each other and being OOV , if only in OOV OOV , by the people rather than by OOV OOV .
<P> I OOV if the OOV are particularly OOV OOV way - I OOV what OOV OOV or OOV OOV would think of your position on the OOV system - but a great deal of OOV and OOV OOV to OOV the OOV of your OOV .
<P> OOV OOV , made in the OOV OOV to your report , is to go so far as to OOV public OOV OOV to the parties which get the most women into OOV .
OOV done with the best of OOV , that could be the road to OOV and OOV OOV and OOV in our OOV , and it is a road I do not feel we should take .
OOV s OOV OOV more democracy , not less .
<SPEAKER OOV LANGUAGE="DE " NAME=" OOV " > Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , our OOV concern must be to OOV OOV OOV between OOV and women .
OOV OOV OOV I do not OOV OOV down , I OOV OOV OOV for OOV OOV women to OOV and progress in the OOV process and in OOV life , for example by OOV OOV in OOV between OOV and women OOV OOV work .
We know from the OOV that in OOV all countries at least OOV the OOV is made up of women , yet the number of women in OOV OOV in OOV and in public OOV is OOV OOV .
I regard the OOV political OOV as being to OOV all OOV to OOV OOV .
I have in OOV framework conditions that OOV women to take responsibility for OOV their own OOV OOV .
A policy that OOV this OOV to economic OOV OOV policy OOV OOV the OOV at the OOV of those OOV .
OOV the issues involved are social OOV , the OOV of OOV work , OOV and OOV , working conditions , working OOV and much more OOV .
<P> It is not a matter of OOV and positive OOV .
If you will OOV me , I consider that OOV in itself to be OOV .
OOV can OOV be positive ?
I do not want to have my OOV because I am a OOV , but because I am OOV for it , and I believe that many women feel the same way .
<P> <SPEAKER OOV LANGUAGE="ES " NAME=" OOV OOV > Mr President , Commissioner , this report OOV with the OOV OOV of OOV and women in the OOV process by OOV the different OOV and the OOV of OOV of women .
We always point out that we women make up OOV of the OOV and therefore we need greater OOV so that women can feel OOV OOV .
<P> However , it is important to point out that the OOV of women into public life and the OOV market in OOV OOV is very recent .
OOV we should also point out that it has OOV OOV to the efforts of women themselves , who have had to OOV OOV OOV .
It is a long road OOV which we must continue to make progress , OOV such time as it is so OOV to find women in the OOV which have always been OOV by OOV that reports such as this are no OOV necessary .
<P> OOV need support , they need more OOV , more OOV OOV of work and OOV help so that they can OOV their OOV OOV with their OOV OOV .
OOV OOV by women means OOV in democracy and the full OOV of their rights on OOV terms with OOV .
<P> We agree with the OOV of the report - and we would like to support it OOV - with the OOV of the specific OOV to OOV OOV OOV OOV , because that could OOV OOV problems for women themselves .
<P> We OOV for more OOV and OOV OOV by women than there is at present , particularly in certain countries of the European Union .
The European OOV of OOV OOV of the national OOV , which already OOV , should be OOV , because it is a very appropriate OOV for the OOV of OOV and of good OOV .
<P> OOV must be involved in all areas - not just in the OOV of their own rights - by OOV in the resolution of OOV problems , in the OOV and on OOV management OOV , in OOV and in social and cultural organisations .
<SPEAKER OOV LANGUAGE="SV" NAME=" OOV " > Mr President , a OOV OOV once said that OOV of OOV is OOV up by women .
But the OOV of women are OOV when it OOV to taking OOV decisions and OOV OOV .
In other words , women , who make up more than OOV of the world ' s OOV , are OOV OOV in political , economic and social areas .
This is OOV in a democracy .
OOV is the OOV between OOV OOV and OOV OOV OOV greater than within the OOV process .
In order to achieve a OOV , a OOV plan of action with a set OOV is OOV .
OOV important part of such a plan is a OOV system .
<P> I am therefore very OOV that Mrs OOV would like to see such a system .
I OOV that the OOV s OOV OOV women in the OOV process be OOV on the OOV of the three most OOV Member States within each field , with OOV reports from the Member States .
<P> It is OOV women who are OOV of OOV of human rights , such as OOV , OOV OOV , OOV in the OOV and OOV .
OOV are OOV on the legal and OOV OOV that OOV these OOV .
This OOV to the OOV being given OOV priority .
OOV , the OOV are not OOV .
The OOV OOV of women in OOV OOV is not only a matter of OOV social OOV and democracy , but is also OOV if women ' s OOV and OOV is to be made the most of .
OOV to OOV women ' s OOV OOV is an OOV OOV .
<P> In OOV , the OOV OOV OOV has OOV for the OOV of OOV .
This OOV after many years ' OOV to increase the number of women involved in the OOV , which is to say OOV women .
OOV OOV OOV OOV OOV of our Government and OOV OOV OOV of the Swedish Parliament .
The only OOV to have OOV OOV this is the OOV OOV .
OOV these women , however , are OOV .
OOV should not only OOV up OOV of OOV , they should also OOV responsibility for decisions OOV our whole world .
<SPEAKER OOV LANGUAGE="SV" NAME=" OOV , OOV " > Mr President , I want to OOV my OOV for a good report .
It should be OOV to OOV that OOV and women should have the same OOV to OOV in OOV at all OOV , but OOV this is not the case .
So what can be done ?
We need greater OOV in the OOV , OOV to good OOV OOV , OOV OOV responsibility , more OOV within OOV systems to OOV with OOV OOV OOV , and OOV working OOV in order to OOV OOV OOV .
In OOV to this , we also need working OOV in OOV , industry and trade OOV which are not OOV on OOV ' s OOV .
<P> OOV the fact that OOV OOV , to a far too great OOV , to be a OOV OOV - in some countries more than in OOV - the problems are greater still in industry and trade OOV organisations .
This is OOV and needs to be the OOV of more attention .
<P> OOV is not a women ' s issue and can only be OOV through cooperation between both OOV .
OOV , OOV must be involved - in a OOV different way than at present - in working towards OOV .
For OOV , more OOV should be OOV involved in working towards OOV within this Parliament .
We need more women in OOV OOV , but - and this is where I agree with Mrs OOV - not because they are women but because it is OOV for so much OOV and OOV to go to OOV .
<SPEAKER OOV LANGUAGE="FR" NAME=" OOV " > Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , Mrs OOV ' s report OOV OOV on a very important issue : OOV between OOV and women is extremely OOV .
OOV the OOV OOV OOV this and we are making OOV progress .
That is why , in my view , we have to OOV OOV the issue of decision making and what Europe can do .
Europe has OOV a OOV role in the OOV for OOV of OOV , on the one hand , and OOV in decision making , on the other .
This has been OOV OOV , however , OOV in OOV the OOV of the OOV of OOV Rights , where decision making on policy is taken into account only with regard to European Parliament or local OOV .
<P> I would just like to OOV you about the OOV situation , where we have a law which is OOV being OOV for local OOV .
In the OOV we are OOV we OOV that every OOV in the OOV OOV there are OOV OOV OOV and OOV about the way that the real situation is being OOV , for , Mrs OOV , OOV OOV , OOV is the most OOV country in Europe in this regard .
OOV , with the OOV of OOV OOV that is being OOV by the government , women make up OOV % of the national OOV .
That is less than OOV % , and that means that the OOV situation is OOV .
The debate we are having today in this OOV is one that has been going on OOV for two or three years in OOV .
I have just one OOV in OOV of OOV , not just political OOV but OOV in general .
<P> This OOV , which is both political and OOV , is this : there is no OOV without OOV , and I OOV the Group of the European OOV ' s OOV to OOV OOV .
OOV us not OOV of positive OOV OOV or OOV OOV .
There can be no OOV in our society without OOV in order to ensure OOV .
This is the only OOV I OOV to make .
It was our OOV OOV in the OOV for OOV .
<P> That is why I want to OOV very OOV , by way of OOV , that there is OOV something important which must be OOV in today ' s debate about decision making , which does not OOV the whole problem OOV OOV OOV , and that is the OOV between political and economic OOV .
We now know what we have to do in the political OOV , and I believe we are making progress .
OOV , I am OOV a great deal from the current OOV in OOV .
As OOV economic OOV in general , and decision making in particular , however , the problem is much more serious and much more OOV .
As my OOV OOV in the Group of the Europe OOV , OOV and OOV OOV has just mentioned , what OOV within OOV OOV and in OOV OOV has as yet OOV been OOV .
We have to work on this .
It is a much more OOV issue .
I believe that in future we must no OOV OOV about political OOV without OOV the appropriate OOV .
These will not be the same OOV in terms of OOV as those used in the political OOV .
The means of OOV better OOV of women both in industry and at a OOV level must be OOV .
<SPEAKER OOV OOV " OOV " > Mr President , when I OOV out in OOV some OOV years OOV , and I OOV OOV to the OOV meeting of the OOV OOV OOV on OOV , which OOV place in OOV OOV , I OOV the only OOV OOV our country had at the time .
OOV the OOV in OOV OOV on how we could help women OOV the world of decision making , the world of employment , OOV , were OOV on OOV .
OOV had OOV OOV OOV under OOV own OOV , but OOV had made so many OOV OOV the way that OOV had become a OOV OOV I do not wish other women to take as a role OOV .
For women who made their way into OOV , OOV , OOV . many years OOV , are women who had to make OOV OOV .
<P> What we want is to give women the opportunity to find their OOV in decision making , OOV and the world of employment in a OOV way , with some help from society .
We might well question how this should be done .
OOV can we help women ?
<P> For years , we have been OOV for OOV for a society which OOV OOV OOV to the OOV that women must be given all OOV , but which has so OOV OOV when it OOV to OOV up OOV , OOV OOV in order to achieve this .
The few OOV which were set up have always been OOV with OOV OOV or OOV - call them what you will .
The OOV OOV system or the OOV system is not a system which only OOV to women .
In my country , where the two OOV regions , OOV and OOV , should OOV in OOV , we also OOV OOV for OOV OOV .
<P> The OOV system , therefore , is not a system OOV OOV for women .
OOV now OOV as if it were a system which only OOV to women , but it is a system that is used in many areas of society .
It is OOV that it will also be OOV to other areas in future .
I have OOV one example .
I cannot OOV , therefore , those who are so OOV about this system .
<P> OOV time , I OOV whether the reason why they are against the OOV system is because , OOV , their OOV is to OOV women from OOV at all , or whether it is OOV because they have OOV OOV .
I am in favour of a OOV system .
This view is not OOV by the OOV of my group , but is by a number of OOV .
I am an OOV of the system .
I OOV OOV it in OOV as the only country in Europe , and it was OOV OOV in OOV .
I believe it is one of the few OOV OOV which OOV at the OOV .
I support the OOV report .
OOV .
<SPEAKER OOV LANGUAGE="ES " OOV OOV > Mr President , Commissioner , OOV the fact that the number of women in education , employment and OOV has OOV and OOV to increase , it is clear that there are still great problems and OOV in the social OOV under OOV .
OOV who OOV in the OOV that , OOV to OOV OOV and the OOV of time , OOV OOV will work in favour of social OOV , are OOV , because they do not OOV the fact that , although OOV before the law and OOV of opportunity are necessary conditions , they are not OOV in themselves .
OOV with the necessary OOV often do not make it , but we know many OOV of OOV who OOV OOV of OOV without having OOV OOV and they are OOV OOV OOV OOV ' .
<P> OOV democracy , which we have been OOV about for many years , is an OOV which is OOV , through OOV OOV , to put an end to the OOV of OOV OOV which has OOV women out of the OOV process .
It is OOV to OOV OOV OOV which OOV and OOV OOV OOV , and it would also be very OOV to OOV the work of the European OOV of OOV in the OOV of women in the field of OOV , which had OOV OOV in the OOV .
<P> On the other hand - as Mrs OOV ' s excellent report points out - it is especially important to OOV the OOV of OOV and women in all OOV at a OOV of a OOV of OOV % and a OOV of OOV % .
In this respect , the systems of OOV OOV and women on OOV OOV , OOV in certain political parties , have had OOV OOV .
So the OOV must be the OOV of national OOV OOV which provide for the OOV of OOV OOV .
The next OOV OOV must OOV amendments to the Treaty in this respect , so that this OOV may be OOV in all the OOV and OOV of the Union .
<P> Mr President , Commissioner , OOV women OOV , if we want to improve our democracy - and that should be our OOV here - it is OOV that we OOV OOV and OOV .
<SPEAKER OOV OOV " NAME=" OOV " > Mr President , the OOV of women in decision making is not only a necessary OOV for the rights and interests of women to be OOV , but also an OOV basis for OOV OOV and OOV democracy .
The OOV of the situation OOV that , OOV various OOV and OOV , this is an area in which major OOV still OOV , with a OOV OOV of women in OOV OOV , both in economic and social OOV of OOV and in OOV , and this OOV to OOV OOV OOV and OOV .
<P> As the rapporteur , OOV I OOV on OOV work , OOV , it is therefore OOV to OOV OOV measures to OOV the OOV of women in OOV , which will also OOV OOV and women to take on an OOV OOV of OOV in public and OOV life .
We must also OOV new OOV OOV , and that OOV within political parties and public and OOV OOV too , with the OOV of OOV the OOV and OOV OOV to the OOV of women in OOV OOV and in political life , OOV OOV OOV action such as the recent case in OOV , where the government OOV the OOV for OOV .
We must change this situation .
<SPEAKER OOV LANGUAGE="FR" NAME=" OOV " > Mr President , Madam Commissioner , I am in favour of a much more OOV OOV of women and OOV in the OOV process than is OOV the case .
But , OOV our rapporteur , I am not OOV enough to OOV that OOV would be different and better if women OOV OOV in the OOV process .
<P> OOV , we must not OOV all OOV OOV the OOV of having the OOV OOV , for example in OOV to OOV the rights of OOV or to the environment , to OOV just a few of the areas mentioned in this OOV by our rapporteur .
OOV , there are OOV who are OOV and OOV OOV of the rights and interests that are OOV to our OOV .
OOV , there are also OOV OOV who just cannot be OOV upon , even when it OOV to OOV more OOV OOV on the OOV OOV .
In my long political OOV I can OOV you that it has OOV been women who , OOV of OOV from me , have OOV to put OOV in my OOV .
<P> It must , of course , be said that , OOV the good OOV of OOV OOV and OOV OOV which have been OOV since OOV by the Community and , OOV all , OOV the OOV OOV of the Council in OOV on the OOV OOV of women and OOV in the OOV process , progress towards these OOV is OOV .
It is OOV at a OOV ' s or a OOV ' s OOV rather than at the OOV of a OOV .
The reason why I OOV against this OOV resolution on the Commission report in the Committee on OOV s Rights and OOV OOV was because it OOV a number of OOV OOV and OOV , which are OOV for women who want to OOV fully in the OOV process .
<P> I am therefore against the OOV to a OOV % OOV , OOV which measures would be OOV for to achieve a OOV OOV of both OOV .
I am of the opinion that such measures are OOV now and in the future , OOV of the OOV of OOV that is OOV .
I am against the OOV OOV to political parties that they OOV OOV systems and , in particular , the OOV system to set up the OOV OOV .
This OOV system would be OOV with the OOV law of my country where , OOV for me , it is not the political OOV which OOV the place of a OOV on the OOV OOV , but the people , by means of OOV OOV .
<P> What we need to do is to call on political parties to OOV their OOV and OOV with a view to OOV OOV of the OOV and OOV OOV to the OOV of women , given that Member States could OOV political parties to put a OOV number of OOV OOV on their OOV OOV , by means of financial OOV if necessary .
Finally , I find it OOV to OOV that only women be OOV to take on OOV OOV and to take decisions when many OOV , who already have such OOV and OOV , would OOV OOV from such OOV .
<P> OOV Group has OOV amendments to get OOV of the OOV OOV I have just OOV and I hope that these amendments will be adopted .
I would just like to make one more OOV , which I should not really do before the vote , on the OOV OOV of our amendments .
It is OOV to the OOV that these amendments are not only OOV but , as OOV , I am OOV to say that , when I OOV these amendments in OOV , I feel like a OOV OOV who can no OOV find OOV OOV .
So , Mr President , it is the OOV OOV which OOV OOV .
I ask Members to be aware of this and to OOV it in OOV when we vote .
<SPEAKER OOV LANGUAGE="DE " NAME=" OOV " > Mr President , Commissioner , as the rapporteur has OOV us , the number of OOV , OOV and OOV on OOV OOV for OOV and women is OOV OOV .
The Treaty of OOV is OOV the legal basis and it OOV OOV OOV between OOV and women as one of the main OOV of European policy .
However , although there has been some OOV progress , there are still some OOV OOV .
There is a OOV OOV in the OOV of OOV and women in the OOV process , and there are OOV OOV between OOV Member States .
OOV Europe , there are especially few women in OOV OOV in OOV and in political decision making .
This means that OOV involved in the economic and social world has to OOV a part if responsibility is to be OOV OOV OOV the public and OOV OOV , in OOV , OOV and OOV life .
OOV all , we need to OOV that the OOV OOV OOV in the OOV market is OOV OOV to the OOV OOV of women in Europe 's OOV , in its trade OOV and in its public sector , and OOV OOV to an OOV social infrastructure , OOV OOV and OOV OOV .
<P> OOV important area we need to OOV is education and OOV .
OOV other things , women have to OOV to OOV OOV to a role in OOV and decision making .
You cannot OOV about OOV when women account for just OOV % of all those involved in OOV at European or national level .
OOV are therefore an important OOV if we are to approach this OOV .
But it is not just a question of OOV the number of women , but also about OOV their role in society and OOV the quality of their work .
<P> OOV and government OOV need to be OOV and where they are OOV to be OOV we need to OOV OOV OOV OOV , such as OOV for OOV OOV .
OOV OOV of women in public life needs to be OOV OOV OOV OOV OOV .
This would also clearly OOV that not only have we OOV OOV but that we have also OOV in certain areas .
This means that we have to OOV OOV OOV OOV , at the same time , OOV what has already been OOV .
<SPEAKER OOV LANGUAGE="FR" NAME=" OOV " > Mr President , I would like to OOV the point of view of working women not only because it is on them , of all women , that the OOV of social OOV OOV most OOV , but also because the workers ' OOV can take OOV in having been the first to OOV for the OOV of OOV between OOV and women .
<P> OOV before the OOV OOV OOV women the right to vote , the workers ' OOV had already , within its own OOV , given OOV women the place they OOV .
The OOV of working women is OOV to the OOV of the working OOV as a whole .
It is women who are the main OOV of OOV employment , OOV OOV work and the OOV OOV that are OOV for such work .
What is OOV is that OOV employment , OOV OOV work and OOV OOV are OOV to OOV .
<P> OOV about OOV between OOV and women will continue to be just so much OOV OOV as long as OOV working OOV are OOV of OOV OOV and as long as there are not enough public OOV , OOV OOV OOV and OOV OOV .
<P> In all areas , European OOV policy is no more OOV to the interests of working women than Member State policy .
<P> OOV I will vote in favour of the report because of the good OOV that are OOV in it , they are still OOV more than good OOV .
<SPEAKER OOV LANGUAGE="DE " OOV " > Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , even today we cannot OOV that OOV and women can work OOV each other with OOV rights in all areas .
That much we all agree upon .
But we also know very well that OOV in decision making , be it by OOV or women , is not an OOV right .
The situation OOV OOV , OOV on the field , the OOV and the area of responsibility .
This is OOV to be a OOV when OOV a decision about any OOV or OOV OOV to OOV a particular OOV , OOV for a OOV or OOV to OOV a particular committee .
<P> However , we can OOV ask if this always OOV .
OOV it not OOV to say that there are still certain OOV in our society which OOV against a OOV or a OOV from the OOV ?
The OOV OOV OOV OOV or OOV OOV are still OOV to the OOV - as are women who make it to the very OOV on management OOV , as OOV or on political OOV .
As a OOV , this OOV is not because of any OOV of OOV or OOV .
A OOV always has to do something OOV to OOV OOV - OOV on its own is not enough , OOV OOV OOV OOV a part .
OOV OOV , OOV OOV and even the OOV OOV of the OOV OOV are OOV to progress .
<P> For far too long we have been OOV women that they have to be better than the OOV they are OOV against .
For that reason OOV we need things like the report before us to OOV society up from time to time and OOV up the OOV .
I believe that the OOV OOV of OOV OOV and a OOV should not be used as OOV for OOV , OOV are they a OOV OOV as OOV in OOV OOV OOV a OOV and a OOV in fact OOV a high OOV of OOV OOV and life OOV that should not be OOV , and should be OOV as a particularly OOV OOV for those in OOV OOV .
It should also be OOV that OOV have the same OOV OOV as women , and all we women OOV here this OOV who have a OOV would be OOV to do all this if our OOV were not also OOV to their OOV as OOV .
<P> OOV , we have not quite OOV that point yet , and it can still be said that OOV a OOV OOV support for a OOV , it is a OOV for a OOV .
So , right from the OOV , when we are OOV young people , we need to OOV these OOV social OOV .
I OOV whether OOV OOV OOV and OOV is the right way to achieve greater OOV , and it should OOV not be this Parliament ' s OOV to call for OOV % OOV in all political OOV at national and international level .
<P> For OOV to OOV we need OOV reports and OOV OOV that OOV OOV OOV , and I therefore OOV you to support the OOV Group ' s amendments .
<SPEAKER OOV OOV " NAME=" OOV OOV " > Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , I wish , first of all , to OOV our OOV Member , Mrs OOV , on the excellent report OOV has OOV to us .
I am not OOV my OOV as a OOV OOV .
I am OOV so in order to be OOV and because I believe they are OOV .
This report is not only excellent , but its OOV OOV is a OOV of the OOV interest to OOV concerned about OOV rights for OOV and women and will OOV OOV as a OOV OOV work for the future .
This OOV the OOV of the OOV 's decision to OOV the OOV of OOV OOV to one OOV .
This OOV does not OOV OOV by the OOV .
We are OOV in OOV and OOV must have a OOV basis .
OOV report , Mrs OOV , is a OOV example of the importance of the political OOV OOV up in this Parliament .
<P> In my OOV I shall OOV on the OOV system .
This is a OOV problem because it OOV our own OOV in OOV .
OOV must be given the opportunity to be OOV in order to OOV what they are OOV of .
OOV OOV systems make the OOV of women even more difficult .
These are , as we have OOV , systems that use OOV OOV OOV .
This OOV has OOV OOV women .
It is not so much the OOV that is to OOV , but the OOV of the parties themselves , which OOV OOV OOV by means which are often less than legal .
<P> OOV , although there is a OOV towards OOV to change this system of OOV OOV OOV OOV , with OOV being OOV , in OOV for example , to set the OOV right and to achieve a OOV of OOV % for both OOV , the OOV government has OOV the OOV of a new OOV law that will OOV OOV the OOV system with the OOV OOV system .
This is an initiative that OOV great OOV for concern and we must be aware that , in this case , this will clearly OOV against women who wish to OOV OOV in OOV .
<SPEAKER OOV OOV NAME=" OOV > Mr President , I should like to OOV Mrs OOV on OOV excellent OOV of the situation in Europe as OOV OOV of the OOV and on OOV OOV approach to proposals and OOV .
I am OOV that the OOV for the OOV who OOV the OOV OOV to the report has OOV because the debate would have been OOV OOV .
<P> OOV me to start by making a political OOV .
The OOV of the report : " The OOV OOV of women and OOV in the OOV process " has a OOV OOV .
The OOV process OOV place in the OOV of OOV ; but it also means OOV OOV in the most important OOV process for the future , which OOV place in the OOV .
So it OOV to both OOV and the OOV of women in OOV OOV cannot be OOV OOV the OOV of time which OOV OOV on OOV OOV is also OOV .
This OOV means that if we want to achieve the OOV OOV , we need to make OOV to the OOV , society , the OOV and the cultural OOV which we have had for OOV .
<P> The debate OOV OOV OOV whether or not OOV , OOV OOV . a OOV OOV on OOV , was an OOV OOV .
I would say , from a OOV point of view , that a set of OOV or rules can OOV change a social fact of life .
However , OOV OOV that rules and OOV can OOV about change , especially if they are OOV by a set of OOV .
So what we need to do , and this is clearly OOV in Mrs OOV 's report , is to OOV three OOV of policy OOV if we are to achieve this important OOV , which concerns democracy in our OOV .
<P> The first OOV of policy is OOV OOV OOV in the OOV and employment , in social systems and social OOV and in education systems and the cultural OOV of our OOV .
The second OOV of policy concerns specific measures and specific positive action to support the policy of OOV in the OOV process .
These measures OOV to OOV systems , where it has been OOV that there is a OOV OOV between OOV systems and the OOV of women , they OOV to the need for OOV OOV which OOV the OOV into OOV , they OOV , of course to political parties and their OOV political OOV and they OOV to OOV for positive action .
OOV OOV have been OOV in this OOV , which OOV that OOV OOV have been OOV in OOV with all the OOV which I have just mentioned , they have had positive results .
OOV we cannot OOV the fact that the only countries which have made any serious OOV with the OOV of women are the countries which had OOV specific OOV .
OOV always with OOV OOV on OOV but with political OOV by the political parties and always with specific OOV OOV .
<P> Finally , there is a third OOV of policy which OOV to OOV by the European Union and OOV on the part of the Member States , such as political OOV of women , OOV at European level - I OOV to the OOV Presidency and the OOV OOV , the OOV of which could OOV national OOV and national OOV - OOV , OOV and , OOV , support for women in the national OOV and on the European political OOV with an important international role , because this is what OOV the OOV for OOV and the OOV for women OOV for OOV OOV .
<P> Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I shall OOV by OOV what the OOV OOV of OOV said when the question of whether or not there should be specific OOV for employment in the Member States was being OOV : ' The OOV of political OOV , the OOV of political OOV is not enough .
OOV without specific OOV OOV and means is OOV OOV . ' <SPEAKER OOV NAME=" President " > OOV you very much , Commissioner .
<P> The debate is OOV .
<P> The vote will take place at OOV .
OOV OOV OOV of EU OOV and OOV OOV <SPEAKER OOV NAME=" President " > The next OOV is the debate on the report ( OOV ) by Mr OOV , on behalf of the Committee on OOV , OOV OOV , OOV and OOV , on the OOV from the Commission to the Council , the European Parliament , the OOV and OOV Committee and the Committee of the OOV : The state of the OOV of the EU OOV and OOV OOV OOV ) OOV - OOV - OOV OOV <SPEAKER OOV NAME=" OOV " > Mr President , Commissioner , OOV I would like to thank those who OOV to have the debate on this report OOV to a time when we can OOV about it and vote on it today , in the OOV .
If the report had been OOV in the OOV it would have been OOV to the OOV million OOV OOV or OOV OOV with the OOV industry OOV .
This sector is responsible for a OOV of the OOV OOV OOV for the EU and a third of the world ' s OOV industry OOV .
OOV of us present here know the problems that the OOV OOV OOV will OOV from this OOV on .
<P> OOV the debate on the Commission OOV it OOV OOV that the OOV OOV OOV is extremely OOV .
OOV and OOV OOV use OOV and other OOV industry OOV , but many of them see themselves OOV as OOV OOV .
The OOV industry ' s OOV is OOV , not just by its use of OOV , but also by the new OOV industry : OOV OOV .
The report OOV the hope that the Commission will also take account of the OOV OOV of OOV in these new OOV .
The report OOV that the OOV industry should be OOV in this OOV .
OOV has its own part to OOV in OOV OOV , particularly in the OOV countries and in OOV .
The report does not OOV a position on whether OOV is a OOV or a OOV OOV .
However , as it is OOV OOV , these OOV must have their place in EU OOV .
In the opinion of the rapporteur , the report OOV an OOV number of OOV OOV OOV to OOV , but it was the wish of the committee , although Parliament has already OOV its view on OOV OOV in the recent OOV report .
OOV more needs to be OOV ; OOV , its OOV should be put into OOV in the Commission in a more OOV way than is the case at present .
<P> The Commission must also OOV OOV the OOV of Mr OOV , OOV on behalf of the Committee on OOV and OOV OOV .
The OOV OOV OOV the open sector of the OOV , where the OOV is OOV in OOV OOV OOV .
For that reason , I cannot agree with the OOV OOV by my OOV , Mrs OOV and Mr OOV , that the OOV on OOV should be responsible for OOV .
OOV in the EU is not OOV to working in OOV with the conditions of the open sector .
The same problem also OOV to Mrs OOV s OOV OOV .
Mrs OOV ' s OOV , in my opinion , is taken account of in the OOV adopted by the committee and not least on the basis of OOV own amendments .
The OOV needs of the OOV industry are OOV with OOV in my report , and , for that reason , I do not think this OOV is necessary at this OOV .
<P> OOV is a OOV OOV OOV .
It has many OOV ; for example , it can be used in the energy industry .
The report OOV the principle OOV to which OOV OOV should be used for the OOV of energy only at the end of the OOV OOV , after which there is no OOV any other use for it and it cannot be OOV .
Member States are the best OOV when it OOV to OOV their own OOV .
The OOV OOV of OOV , their importance as OOV of OOV OOV , and their OOV for future OOV will be best OOV OOV the OOV of the principle of OOV , and there is no OOV for OOV the Commission 's OOV in OOV OOV .
OOV , it has an important OOV to do , OOV the OOV of OOV OOV .
The needs of the OOV industry must also be taken into account in OOV policy .
The European OOV OOV will OOV OOV OOV OOV if the rules are the same for all .
If the OOV of OOV and people is not OOV in Europe , it should not be OOV OOV .
<P> The OOV OOV of OOV can improve employment , especially in OOV areas , and , OOV , OOV also OOV with the OOV s employment OOV .
OOV and OOV must find new OOV for OOV .
For example , OOV OOV to make OOV OOV would OOV more OOV for other OOV .
OOV OOV must be OOV within a new OOV OOV of OOV .
OOV can be used more in OOV , as an OOV OOV and OOV OOV .
OOV OOV : if the OOV do well , so will people .
<P> <SPEAKER OOV NAME=" OOV " > Mr President , Commissioner , on behalf of the Committee on OOV and OOV OOV , I would first like to OOV my OOV OOV to the rapporteur , Mr OOV , and the Committee on OOV , OOV OOV , OOV and OOV , for an excellent report and some excellent cooperation .
The Commission has OOV a OOV OOV on the state of OOV OOV in the OOV industry .
This OOV has OOV that OOV OOV have been made the subject of very necessary debate in the EU , which , OOV , OOV all too OOV .
<P> The Committee on OOV and OOV OOV is OOV OOV with the OOV set OOV by the Commission and Parliament ' s OOV report .
We would like to OOV the importance of the whole OOV OOV in our own opinion , and that OOV the importance of the OOV of OOV and OOV OOV , which is responsible for the OOV OOV OOV of the OOV industry .
OOV OOV in Europe still OOV on the OOV OOV OOV OOV by OOV million OOV OOV OOV and the OOV they are OOV in .
<P> The OOV OOV on OOV OOV OOV OOV .
We , the Committee on OOV and OOV OOV , have OOV the OOV agreement process OOV , as , in our opinion , the OOV OOV OOV OOV OOV account of the importance of OOV .
OOV and all OOV OOV are a OOV OOV OOV , and their importance in this respect has to be OOV .
<P> The OOV of OOV of OOV in the EU is OOV .
There are more OOV to deal with them but there is a OOV of OOV .
OOV resources have been OOV in the area of the environment , but the OOV on OOV responsible for OOV has very few resources to work with , as does that for industry .
For that reason , I support OOV No OOV by Mrs OOV on behalf of the OOV Group .
OOV I want to OOV my support for OOV OOV OOV and OOV in particular , which are from the opinion by the Committee on OOV and OOV OOV .
OOV committee OOV them by general OOV .
<SPEAKER OOV NAME=" OOV " > Mr President , Commissioner , may I start by OOV an interest , or two interests , in this issue .
I have an interest in a OOV OOV in OOV OOV , OOV from my OOV , so that OOV me a OOV interest .
OOV OOV I OOV OOV to see the OOV industry at work as the OOV of OOV , the OOV of European OOV OOV .
So you see the OOV OOV OOV in this report OOV even with me .
<P> OOV I welcome this OOV and OOV my OOV at its OOV on the importance of this industry .
OOV the rapporteur and other OOV I OOV that OOV is a very important industry , important for the OOV and important for the environment .
<P> I would like to OOV the rapporteur on his report .
In itself it has made quite a contribution towards the OOV of OOV and this is to be OOV , even if our OOV on the Committee on OOV , OOV OOV , OOV and OOV had to make it a OOV OOV OOV than he would wish .
OOV to say too much about OOV than too OOV .
<P> I OOV with interest his OOV to OOV and the OOV in the OOV of the OOV industry .
I OOV to believe that OOV all these OOV OOV of OOV OOV , we will continue to need OOV for our OOV , because it is the OOV that most people are still OOV with and I certainly am .
OOV , of course , we shall continue to need OOV for all the other OOV to which it is put , such as in OOV and other possible new OOV .
The rapporteur and the Committee on OOV OOV attention to the OOV for OOV into new OOV of OOV .
<P> OOV I OOV one OOV of OOV .
It is a OOV OOV to ask the Commission to ensure that OOV OOV in Europe are OOV .
I think that might be OOV the Commissioner 's OOV a OOV OOV .
I see he is OOV so OOV he OOV with me .
<P> OOV , the Commission has to ensure that OOV OOV OOV place .
That is the OOV issue here , rather than OOV to favour our industry .
This is a OOV , OOV industry , very important to the OOV of Europe and to our environment , and this is a very OOV report .
<SPEAKER OOV NAME=" OOV " > Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , I would like to thank the rapporteur for his OOV approach to the work he has done , which is so OOV of OOV , on this report , which is a OOV OOV of human life in OOV OOV OOV country .
OOV third of our OOV area is OOV in OOV , and if you OOV our OOV to the OOV in the OOV , there is still more OOV .
OOV industry actually OOV two and a OOV million people , which is no OOV matter , and , as we know , OOV for a OOV of OOV OOV .
<P> OOV we OOV the OOV of OOV that is OOV in OOV I think we also have to take into account the OOV of OOV OOV that were OOV and OOV OOV to OOV .
OOV , this work of many OOV will not be taken into account when the OOV of OOV OOV is OOV .
OOV so it is that we are OOV just those who have OOV their OOV and are now OOV OOV to do some OOV , OOV they have first and OOV been OOV them for OOV .
They who have OOV their OOV OOV for OOV , OOV OOV OOV and know this OOV OOV , would be OOV , because there are Member States in which people no OOV have OOV to OOV a OOV , OOV they start OOV them on their own OOV .
For this reason , OOV OOV in this report is very important .
OOV and OOV are OOV the most important OOV OOV and OOV , and it has also been OOV that the OOV of OOV OOV in the OOV to OOV OOV is even greater than that of OOV .
But , ladies and gentlemen , the situation is such that we cannot OOV OOV : of the two we can only OOV OOV .
<P> OOV OOV peace .
That is OOV an OOV greater OOV when it OOV to OOV - I think it is OOV for OOV - and it OOV OOV OOV .
A OOV OOV is OOV , and you can OOV against it , whether it is OOV or OOV ; you can only OOV against a OOV when it is OOV .
The use of OOV is OOV OOV for OOV , and especially now , when we are at the OOV where OOV is OOV further OOV from OOV , which is OOV .
I would OOV that the Commission should OOV to some appropriate OOV a set of OOV for the OOV use of OOV , as we are now on the OOV of a OOV with regard to OOV OOV .
OOV the basis of the OOV is OOV and the OOV is on new OOV .
<SPEAKER OOV NAME=" OOV > Mr President , Commissioner , I too would like to OOV the rapporteur , Mr OOV , for his excellent work and the OOV of cooperation that he has OOV to OOV in his approach to this important issue .
OOV , the Commission OOV OOV for a new OOV of OOV , in which a field of industry has been OOV OOV from the point of view of OOV OOV .
The report is OOV in its present form .
OOV the OOV Presidency an OOV OOV was OOV to it at the committee OOV : that the EU should be the world ' s most OOV and OOV OOV in the OOV sector also .
<P> OOV group OOV the OOV set OOV in the report and most of the amendments to it .
We OOV are OOV a few amendments , which we ask you to support .
I would in particular like to OOV OOV No OOV , which OOV the question of the importance of small and OOV OOV .
OOV it is at its best , the OOV sector can OOV as a OOV for other OOV OOV how OOV OOV resources can be OOV , how OOV from the OOV OOV in OOV and how the OOV OOV OOV OOV in an OOV OOV , yet , at the same time , OOV OOV , way .
In this OOV , the importance of OOV with OOV should be OOV more OOV .
<P> It is also important to OOV the importance of OOV for less OOV areas , and especially for OOV areas in OOV .
This importance is particular OOV in the area of employment .
The Union should work more OOV in the future to OOV small OOV that use OOV OOV , for example .
<SPEAKER OOV NAME=" OOV " > Mr President , I welcome the rapporteur 's OOV on OOV OOV OOV which are indeed of OOV importance to the European Union .
However , the Commission 's OOV is rather a OOV which OOV together OOV the OOV industry which is OOV and OOV with OOV OOV OOV and also OOV OOV .
The OOV industry is both OOV and OOV , to say the least , and this is not how we OOV the European Union OOV how things work in the Member States .
<P> The OOV industry OOV that there is a OOV of OOV of its particular OOV with regard to the OOV OOV sector .
The Commission could be open to the OOV , indeed , that OOV it OOV an OOV sector OOV of OOV .
I would OOV , Commissioner , that you look OOV at this question and OOV this whole OOV of OOV .
<P> OOV I also take issue with the report 's OOV OOV : OOV is not a OOV OOV , it is a OOV in its own right .
I know there are particular OOV and OOV interests here , but I do not believe that we can OOV OOV as a OOV industry .
It is a OOV OOV OOV sector which has also OOV as a OOV .
<P> OOV change : the rapporteur OOV some OOV OOV here .
I agree with OOV that we should OOV OOV the OOV OOV .
That is what we all want to do .
OOV are , of course , important OOV of OOV but the OOV for OOV of OOV in the EU is OOV , even if welcome .
However , I OOV to OOV the OOV to the OOV .
We have had OOV since time OOV , and this has OOV to do with our present problems with OOV change , so I agree with my other OOV and cannot see what possible OOV that OOV has .
<P> Finally , with regard to the OOV industry : it should OOV up its OOV OOV OOV on the OOV of the environment , and it is also important to OOV into the OOV of OOV in the OOV sector , particularly with regard to OOV in the OOV sector .
<SPEAKER OOV OOV " > Mr President , I should like to OOV OOV to the importance of OOV from a OOV development as well as a OOV OOV .
European OOV will always OOV OOV to the OOV of European OOV OOV - indeed , it OOV the main OOV for economic OOV .
<P> OOV , OOV OOV ensure that many farmers cannot increase their OOV from OOV and , therefore , OOV OOV OOV from OOV OOV are OOV if OOV OOV are to OOV from economic OOV .
We have OOV the OOV of OOV development programmes , including the OOV OOV and other such OOV which have OOV OOV much OOV employment in small and OOV OOV in OOV areas OOV Europe .
However , the OOV to OOV in OOV OOV can also be a very OOV and OOV OOV OOV for farmers to increase their OOV OOV .
<P> In the OOV government 's national development plan for OOV , a OOV of OOV OOV is being OOV for OOV OOV .
This would be OOV under the common agricultural OOV development programme .
This OOV OOV will support a OOV programme in OOV of over OOV OOV OOV OOV year over the OOV of the plan .
The OOV will be for OOV OOV , with OOV , OOV and OOV , as well as OOV OOV .
In OOV to OOV support and measures , an OOV of OOV OOV has been OOV in the regional OOV programme for OOV in OOV OOV , OOV OOV and general OOV OOV .
<P> OOV regard to the EU OOV programme for OOV and the OOV OOV available for OOV , it is OOV that the end OOV of this OOV is a quality , OOV OOV OOV , one OOV of OOV over time a OOV both for the OOV OOV and the OOV .
<P> OOV of the OOV OOV of OOV to OOV , the necessary OOV OOV could be OOV in the OOV years of OOV of new OOV .
This must be OOV if the European sector is to OOV the OOV of quality and OOV in the future .
<P> On a OOV OOV , Parliament should be aware of the serious OOV to the world 's OOV OOV , which are OOV by OOV million OOV OOV .
OOV OOV OOV is being done on the OOV of OOV OOV .
In this regard , we should be aware of the work of the European OOV OOV and its OOV and OOV into the OOV of new OOV OOV .
If we are to OOV the need for OOV , we must OOV these problems very OOV on .
<SPEAKER OOV LANGUAGE="FR" NAME=" OOV > Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , the Commission OOV is OOV OOV , especially OOV in OOV the still very OOV situation of the people working in the OOV and OOV OOV who were the OOV of the OOV OOV OOV .
We must therefore welcome this OOV approach to OOV policy and the Community OOV OOV .
OOV OOV of OOV at a time of OOV OOV OOV , the OOV involved in the enlargement and OOV of the OOV world OOV OOV the OOV and the OOV of the OOV is , of course , a good OOV .
<P> However , I feel OOV to OOV Mr OOV that I was rather OOV by his report , which OOV to me to take a OOV OOV approach towards the OOV of the OOV industry .
I get the OOV OOV that he OOV OOV OOV as OOV OOV OOV OOV on OOV OOV OOV OOV a OOV every OOV years .
<P> OOV from OOV , where I OOV OOV this OOV of OOV OOV , which it is OOV OOV to the OOV industry to OOV , I OOV think , Mr OOV , that the OOV of Europe OOV OOV in its OOV .
OOV I may be OOV of the OOV of this approach to OOV the OOV OOV , I think the report should have taken account of OOV where OOV OOV , for example in OOV , as well as OOV other than OOV OOV .
It OOV to me that there was a OOV to OOV OOV to do with OOV and other OOV OOV OOV made in other OOV of Europe .
<P> In OOV , we will support this report as its approach is quite OOV , as well as the excellent amendments OOV by our OOV , OOV for OOV No OOV , which OOV to us OOV .
<SPEAKER OOV LANGUAGE="DE " NAME=" OOV " > Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , a OOV and OOV OOV and OOV industry is OOV important for Europe in many OOV .
<P> I would like to OOV you about both environmental OOV and OOV and economic OOV .
As a OOV OOV , OOV is the most important OOV energy OOV in Europe , and no one should OOV the importance in regional policy terms of small and OOV OOV in the OOV industry and in OOV as OOV of OOV in OOV areas .
This sector is a OOV OOV in a OOV agricultural and OOV industry .
OOV , the OOV and OOV OOV provide OOV of OOV in Europe .
<P> A OOV OOV industry can make a OOV contribution to OOV OOV and to OOV the OOV OOV .
OOV OOV , we must OOV our OOV in order to OOV OOV against OOV .
I am therefore very OOV to the OOV OOV for OOV OOV .
I would particularly like to OOV attention to OOV OOV and OOV OOV in the OOV .
<P> OOV proposals for the OOV industry need to be OOV .
The use of OOV and OOV OOV in the OOV industry should be OOV , and OOV should OOV be used OOV of other OOV OOV .
A further OOV of OOV is that it OOV OOV OOV OOV of OOV over long OOV .
I therefore support the approach of OOV OOV OOV and OOV measures for OOV OOV to OOV public OOV .
We need to provide information and OOV about the OOV of these OOV OOV Europe .
<P> I am not OOV a Community OOV policy , but rather a common OOV OOV for Europe , with the Commission OOV a OOV OOV role .
The various OOV of OOV and OOV OOV should be OOV within a OOV OOV , and it would make OOV for this to be the OOV for OOV , which would also need to be OOV OOV to OOV with the OOV OOV of OOV involved .
OOV OOV there can be no OOV industry .
So I hope that the House will OOV this OOV and vote for OOV OOV OOV and OOV <P> <SPEAKER OOV LANGUAGE="DE " NAME=" OOV , OOV " > Mr President , Commissioner , I would first like to both OOV and OOV with the rapporteur , Mr OOV .
This report on the OOV and OOV OOV OOV just about every important area OOV , and very much of what it OOV is OOV .
<P> However , I would still like to OOV on a OOV of points .
OOV , I think what is OOV here is a OOV to the OOV OOV in this sector as OOV OOV and OOV .
This particularly OOV to the OOV industry at present , where more and more OOV are OOV because they believe this is OOV if they are to OOV OOV .
OOV OOV is that Europe , which I hope will itself be OOV together , will OOV be OOV with OOV OOV with those in OOV and other countries , where the OOV which OOV are OOV under is OOV OOV on to their OOV , which are being OOV in the most OOV way .
I therefore hope that the Commission will OOV forward appropriate and clear proposals , if at all possible in the form of OOV .
<P> As OOV the environment , we should not OOV OOV .
OOV years after OOV we are still a long way from being able to OOV OOV what was agreed there in terms of OOV .
In the long OOV , we will OOV have to OOV for our OOV OOV to OOV what the OOV OOV of the OOV OOV cannot , for OOV OOV .
So in future OOV will OOV all be very OOV involved in environmental OOV , which OOV me to my third point , that is to say the OOV .
<P> I OOV very much hope that the OOV of the OOV OOV and OOV even of a OOV Parliament , by OOV of the OOV , will not just give OOV to OOV OOV but actually become a OOV .
OOV this would have a OOV OOV on OOV in the industry , it would make OOV OOV OOV .
That is my last point .
<P> OOV OOV up , this report OOV a OOV OOV .
It OOV too much to OOV OOV , and it rather OOV the OOV of OOV to OOV something that really can no OOV be OOV .
We only have to OOV what OOV to the OOV industry .
<P> I do not think it OOV OOV to OOV this sector .
But the OOV of OOV small and OOV OOV which is OOV in OOV No OOV is very positive .
It is also extremely important for us to consider the issue of OOV , given the most recent OOV in this sector .
<SPEAKER OOV LANGUAGE="FR" OOV " > Mr President , OOV Mr OOV , I have no OOV with the OOV OOV OOV in this report , OOV for the fact that I OOV , with the OOV of OOV , at the Commission under the OOV of Commissioner OOV .
Mr President , I would like to thank the Commission for OOV this OOV on the OOV industry ' .
I would also like to thank the rapporteur for OOV some of my amendments in the Committee on OOV , OOV OOV , OOV and OOV , even OOV he OOV no need for OOV No OOV , which I OOV .
<P> I would like to ask just one question , Mr President , which OOV in OOV with OOV No OOV and OOV to the position of the OOV industry within the Commission services .
I OOV in the OOV that , in OOV 2000 , Commissioner OOV OOV the fact that the OOV industry must not be OOV as OOV to the OOV and OOV OOV , as the place it now OOV within the European Commission might OOV one to believe .
OOV this also the opinion of the Commission ?
If this is the case , what are its OOV for the future ?
<SPEAKER OOV LANGUAGE="DE " NAME=" OOV > Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , OOV is a OOV OOV , a OOV OOV with a future .
OOV OOV , it OOV and OOV its way back into the OOV OOV from which it OOV .
So we should not OOV OOV in the OOV OOV OOV on OOV - we should make OOV that the priority area for OOV is OOV OOV up with OOV OOV , especially in the field of OOV .
I believe that OOV will be a OOV more important for us in the future than it has been in the OOV .
<P> As OOV is also very OOV used in the international OOV industry , the OOV industry OOV OOV problems .
It has to deal with a OOV number of OOV trade OOV , a OOV of national OOV and OOV OOV and also , to some OOV , OOV OOV , OOV and OOV OOV .
This is an area where the European Commission should OOV OOV
OOV OOV the OOV sector is an OOV one for OOV OOV OOV , OOV including OOV
<P> I would like to thank OOV OOV , as OOV small and OOV OOV is , of course , a OOV and OOV matter , and one where we have an important OOV in the Commission .
<P> However , there is also the matter of making appropriate OOV to OOV OOV and OOV , because OOV OOV in Europe in particular OOV OOV .
We believe it is high time that the OOV OOV directive was adopted .
This directive in particular would OOV great progress to be made in OOV OOV .
<P> As OOV world trade , I would like to OOV that OOV has very OOV legislation in this area .
This is something we also need to OOV because OOV is , after all , not just a OOV OOV and a OOV OOV , but it will also be OOV important in future through OOV .
That is why we especially want to OOV OOV OOV OOV OOV , which will make an important contribution to Europe 's energy OOV , so that this is also an area where OOV has an important role to OOV .
<SPEAKER OOV OOV > Mr President , I would like to thank the Commission and Mr OOV , who OOV the OOV report .
As a OOV of the Committee on the OOV , OOV OOV and OOV OOV , I am especially OOV by how the report has OOV to take account of OOV and even OOV OOV conditions in the industry , OOV , as it is , in the market .
<P> I OOV wish to OOV the issue of OOV , which is OOV with in the second OOV of the report .
The report OOV for the OOV of the OOV industry in the OOV OOV .
This is most OOV .
It will support many OOV of the energy policy which the EU is OOV to OOV through , and which it has just mentioned in the OOV OOV on energy .
OOV will OOV the situation OOV our OOV in energy and its OOV OOV , which , OOV , are in OOV ; and it will OOV the OOV OOV of OOV and OOV , and OOV with it the OOV OOV of the use of OOV and OOV for energy .
OOV that OOV OOV is on a OOV basis , it is clearly also a OOV energy OOV .
OOV , OOV has many OOV positive OOV that favour employment .
<P> On the whole , OOV should be OOV to OOV rather than OOV , for example , which is now how it is OOV by the EU , going against what is OOV OOV .
The OOV of OOV is an OOV OOV fact .
OOV OOV OOV through the OOV of OOV OOV and the OOV of OOV OOV .
OOV OOV is in principle OOV the same as that of other OOV that OOV from OOV , for example OOV .
The time necessary for the process is OOV , however .
OOV to a new , OOV OOV report , OOV should be OOV from OOV OOV , which take OOV of years to form .
OOV to its OOV and OOV OOV OOV , OOV must be OOV as a OOV OOV , but because it OOV OOV more OOV than other OOV , a new , third OOV should be OOV and OOV between OOV OOV and energy OOV OOV OOV OOV is OOV .
OOV is a OOV OOV with a OOV OOV OOV .
<P> It is OOV that OOV OOV , as with OOV OOV , OOV OOV OOV OOV in the OOV .
The OOV agreement does not OOV OOV from OOV OOV in the OOV OOV OOV , as the OOV that is OOV in OOV would be OOV in any case when the OOV OOV .
OOV , OOV on OOV OOV and OOV OOV in OOV have come out in recent years and their results OOV it would be OOV to have a OOV of OOV OOV OOV which OOV account of OOV OOV in OOV as a whole .
<P> OOV we OOV of OOV it is OOV OOV OOV of OOV .
The area OOV to energy use is very small OOV to the areas of OOV used in OOV and OOV .
The OOV OOV OOV for less than one OOV OOV of the OOV area of OOV OOV .
OOV , the economic OOV of OOV is important in those areas where there is a OOV of OOV .
For example , in OOV we use less than OOV the OOV OOV of OOV each year .
We therefore do not OOV the OOV , because the interest is enough to get by on .
<P> The report OOV the Commission to OOV the OOV and OOV of Community OOV action having an OOV on OOV OOV , in order to improve OOV .
This need for OOV and OOV would in particular OOV to OOV to OOV , and one important OOV on the road would be to change the way it is OOV and its OOV , to OOV with its OOV OOV .
<SPEAKER OOV OOV NAME=" OOV " > Mr President , first I wish to thank all the OOV of Parliament and , in particular , the rapporteur OOV OOV , for his excellent report .
The Commission is OOV to OOV the report and the OOV resolution .
They are in OOV with the Commission ' s OOV .
The report is OOV and OOV in OOV those OOV OOV that OOV OOV in the OOV industry , both the OOV and the OOV .
We particularly agree with you that OOV OOV , such as OOV OOV , OOV and OOV and development work , are OOV of the position OOV OOV in European industry .
OOV the most important OOV is OOV there is this high level of OOV OOV .
<P> OOV of all I would like to OOV a OOV OOV in just a few words on how important this sector of industry is .
It OOV for OOV % of all OOV OOV in the EU , whether OOV in terms of OOV OOV or number of OOV .
It is OOV OOV that a OOV of OOV million OOV OOV OOV OOV OOV to industry , and the sector is OOV OOV in the OOV
The industry is often OOV in OOV regions , where it OOV to OOV economic OOV , OOV of employment and the infrastructure .
OOV main areas of the industry form one of the OOV OOV OOV in the European Union .
The OOV of its OOV OOV at more than EUR OOV OOV , its OOV OOV at EUR OOV OOV .
It OOV OOV employment to OOV million people , and OOV the OOV is much OOV than that .
<P> In the Commission OOV the state of OOV in the OOV industry and OOV OOV to it was OOV by OOV the sector in a new way , as a OOV , in which each sector ' s OOV OOV the OOV of the other OOV .
In such an OOV by OOV any OOV of OOV areas may be OOV , but OOV can be OOV from a OOV OOV .
The OOV OOV a basis for the future OOV of OOV having an OOV on OOV in this industry .
That is why the Commission has made a OOV of OOV OOV of the OOV industry and OOV OOV to it .
OOV on the OOV and OOV OOV have already been OOV .
In OOV , the Commission has OOV , as an OOV to the OOV in hand , two OOV for debate .
OOV is an OOV committee on OOV and OOV OOV , OOV work OOV under way again in OOV , and the other is a OOV for OOV and OOV OOV .
This OOV OOV a major role , as it OOV it possible to OOV OOV OOV OOV and OOV OOV with OOV , OOV organisations and other OOV parties .
OOV from the Community ' s OOV , such as Parliament and the Commission , as well as the Member States also OOV in the OOV .
<P> The first OOV was OOV here in OOV at the OOV of OOV , it was made up of people of OOV , and I might OOV that the rapporteur , Mr OOV , was also present .
There were also OOV about OOV , which Mrs OOV mentioned : OOV and OOV and OOV OOV rights were OOV .
The next OOV is to be OOV in OOV in OOV .
That will OOV on a OOV look at how OOV and OOV OOV can , for their part , OOV OOV development and OOV their contribution to the OOV of the environment at all OOV of the OOV OOV from OOV itself right up to the end OOV .
<P> It is OOV OOV more important to take account of OOV development .
In OOV we shall be OOV the meeting of the European Council in OOV , at which important decisions will be taken in this area .
OOV OOV are those in which all the economic , social and environmental OOV of OOV development are OOV OOV on one another .
OOV OOV use OOV OOV OOV and the most OOV OOV and OOV OOV , so its contribution may well be especially important for OOV development .
<P> In OOV to Mrs OOV ' s question I would say this : we OOV very well that OOV today OOV from the OOV industry OOV , and OOV OOV OOV on OOV just as much as many other OOV .
The problem for the Commission has been that the resources of the OOV for OOV have OOV by OOV % over the last year .
We have OOV OOV OOV in all .
We have had to OOV OOV and OOV .
I am OOV OOV to take this matter up now as a subject for OOV again , OOV with a OOV to OOV at in which sector or in OOV with which sector OOV would best be OOV .
I will be in OOV with OOV of the industry after this debate .
<P> OOV again I wish to thank Mr OOV for an excellent report and the other OOV for their contribution to this work .
<P> <SPEAKER OOV NAME=" President " > OOV you very much , Commissioner .
<P> The debate is OOV .
<P> We shall now OOV to the vote .
<SPEAKER OOV OOV " NAME=" OOV > Madam President , I wish to put a OOV to you and the House .
OOV report was to have been OOV this OOV , but has been put back to this OOV , OOV with the vote .
OOV I cannot OOV , so I would be OOV if it could be OOV OOV the next OOV .
<SPEAKER OOV LANGUAGE="DE " NAME=" OOV " > Madam President , this is OOV what we OOV when the OOV OOV was done OOV with - that we would no OOV be able to do our work on OOV OOV OOV .
<P> <SPEAKER OOV NAME=" President " > Mrs OOV , you will OOV that it is not for the President to OOV on these OOV .
OOV me say only that , in the OOV case OOV to me , Mr OOV s report was OOV for this OOV , but we did not have time to deal with it .
Mr OOV is OOV this OOV and cannot OOV OOV to present his report .
I think it appropriate , OOV there are any OOV , to agree to his OOV to OOV the report OOV to his OOV this OOV and in view of the fact that the report could not be OOV at the OOV time .
<SPEAKER OOV LANGUAGE="DE " NAME=" OOV " > Madam President , we are quite OOV for you to OOV OOV with OOV , as it were .
However , I would like to support Mrs OOV and make the OOV point that if we are having OOV OOV it is not OOV for reports not to be OOV on because OOV are no OOV present on OOV OOV .
We agree with the OOV adopted today , but we would like you to make it clear once again , including to committee OOV , that Members should ensure that they OOV OOV OOV OOV .
<SPEAKER OOV NAME=" President " > Mr OOV , I agree OOV with you .
It Mr OOV s report had not been OOV for this OOV , I should not have had this opportunity .
<SPEAKER OOV LANGUAGE="FR" NAME=" OOV > Madam President , ladies and gentlemen , I can only OOV the OOV made by Mrs OOV and Mr OOV , but I feel that the problems OOV amendments to the OOV are also OOV to what I would call OOV OOV , as we OOV OOV able to OOV to the set OOV .
We are OOV having to OOV the OOV of reports .
I think this is OOV to the fact that we are not OOV our time well enough and that we should OOV also change and OOV a number of OOV in which the House OOV .
I believe , however , that OOV the OOV to OOV OOV is the main reason for all these OOV from the OOV .
If we OOV the OOV OOV working time to three and a OOV OOV , the next OOV we shall be down to two OOV .
What is the point of the European Parliament ?
It is up to all the Members of the House to OOV how serious they are in their work , in OOV with the OOV they have made as Members of Parliament .
This is the issue being OOV again .
<P> <SPEAKER OOV OOV OOV " > Madam President , I want to make two OOV points in this OOV .
The first is that all OOV we have been OOV people OOV about the decision to OOV the OOV OOV .
OOV OOV decision was taken and however we OOV in that decision , a OOV decision was taken by the House and the next opportunity to change that will OOV when we OOV the OOV for OOV .
I think it is OOV to OOV OOV it .
<P> OOV , if we look at the OOV for this OOV , we see that the OOV for OOV OOV was OOV .
So OOV we could also look at OOV of making better use of our time and OOV the OOV OOV for OOV .
OOV we would all be OOV by OOV OOV and could go OOV and do our OOV on OOV .
<SPEAKER OOV LANGUAGE="FR" NAME=" OOV " > Madam President , I am one of those who were most OOV to OOV OOV with the OOV OOV .
I am therefore OOV to state that I think that , when a OOV is made to OOV the vote on a report which is OOV for the end of OOV ' s OOV , and which must be OOV by a Member who has to OOV 2000 OOV to get OOV and who , if he cannot take the only OOV available , on OOV OOV , is then OOV to go OOV on OOV OOV , we OOV also to OOV some OOV with regard to his situation in future .
OOV , this is a vote I consider OOV , and it OOV us in this situation , which we must OOV in as responsible a OOV as possible in the OOV OOV .
<SPEAKER OOV NAME=" President " > We do not need to start a debate on the issue .
<SPEAKER OOV NAME=" OOV " > Madam President , in the OOV of these issues , a OOV problem has OOV with the OOV OOV in OOV to transport .
It is OOV OOV next OOV to get on the OOV OOV at OOV OOV on a OOV .
That has OOV in many of our OOV and OOV OOV having to OOV on the OOV OOV OOV on OOV .
That is not OOV .
OOV you OOV OOV to the OOV and put OOV OOV back to OOV on OOV OOV to OOV our OOV , so that they can OOV here all OOV .
<SPEAKER OOV NAME=" President " > Mrs OOV , since you OOV the subject , I can OOV you that OOV OOV OOV has OOV Mr OOV as the OOV OOV to deal with all these problems , and any OOV , which may OOV .
I had a OOV meeting with Mr OOV this OOV and , on my initiative , we OOV these specific problems , because they are problems that I am well aware of , and not just for one OOV but for all the Members of the House .
<SPEAKER OOV LANGUAGE="FR" NAME=" OOV " > Madam President , Parliament OOV to OOV the OOV OOV to OOV OOV , with a OOV OOV in the number of working OOV for OOV OOV .
We are OOV that they should not be OOV OOV .
<SPEAKER OOV NAME=" President " > Mrs OOV , this is not a OOV OOV .
OOV OOV OOV <SPEAKER OOV OOV " NAME=" OOV " > Madam President , OOV OOV from OOV to OOV I was in the OOV ' s OOV OOV with the OOV , as I OOV do , and he was OOV me all about his problems OOV to working OOV , OOV and OOV .
I OOV OOV that OOV OOV in the civil OOV sector , including OOV for OOV the work of OOV OOV , were OOV to be OOV in the European Parliament , OOV with OOV OOV , and I OOV OOV that I would ask for a OOV to the Member States to give OOV OOV and OOV OOV , for OOV are of OOV importance for our safety .
<SPEAKER OOV NAME=" OOV OOV > Madam President , last OOV I OOV the OOV to give OOV to the OOV Members of this House on the recent decision of the OOV government OOV OOV to OOV OOV .
In no OOV for a resolution on human rights do we find the OOV OOV to the OOV of OOV OOV many countries are OOV mentioned .
<P> This is most OOV as the OOV from the OOV government has been OOV in order to OOV OOV to OOV and to OOV OOV as a OOV OOV in its OOV of OOV .
<P> On human rights , once again , OOV has been OOV through in this Parliament .
<P> United OOV OOV Rights Commission in OOV <SPEAKER OOV OOV NAME=" OOV " > The OOV of the OOV transport sector and the OOV OOV between OOV has OOV serious problems by OOV safety OOV for OOV OOV .
It is therefore OOV that we OOV OOV OOV in order to OOV a high OOV of safety which is not OOV by OOV .
<P> OOV the Committee on OOV and the rapporteur have OOV on the Commission 's proposals .
It is also OOV , where no proposals for agreed rules are made by OOV parties , that the European Parliament itself take the initiative on OOV OOV and on working OOV and other OOV for the OOV and OOV OOV by OOV OOV OOV , taking account of the needs of workers and safety OOV .
<P> This matter is even more OOV given that the Commission , OOV under OOV from the OOV OOV , has OOV in the OOV to OOV any measures OOV OOV OOV .
<SPEAKER OOV LANGUAGE="FR" NAME=" OOV , OOV and OOV " > The only reason we OOV in favour of this OOV OOV for a resolution is the OOV adopted in favour of OOV the OOV OOV and the OOV of a few OOV OOV OOV the OOV of women , the OOV of OOV and OOV to OOV OOV .
<P> OOV the resolution OOV OOV a number of countries , such as OOV , OOV , OOV , OOV OOV and OOV , where human rights are OOV OOV in many , if not all areas , not a OOV is said OOV the major OOV , the European Union in particular , which , OOV they do not OOV OOV human rights at OOV , OOV them in their OOV OOV , OOV OOV or by OOV OOV to OOV that OOV OOV over human rights .
<P> OOV human rights OOV come from those OOV from the OOV of human rights or from OOV working OOV to OOV the OOV of OOV , at least in the areas they are responsible for , we OOV our OOV .
OOV , as far as the major OOV which are responsible for the OOV and OOV of the greater part of the world , and their political OOV , are concerned , OOV to human rights are , OOV OOV , OOV more than OOV OOV OOV by their OOV and military action and by those OOV of state ' OOV used as a OOV to OOV the OOV interests of major financial OOV that do not OOV one OOV about human OOV or their rights .
<P> OOV OOV OOV ( OOV ) <SPEAKER OOV OOV " NAME=" OOV " > Madam President , still in the OOV ' s OOV on the OOV from OOV to OOV and still OOV to the OOV - I even OOV his OOV , OOV - I OOV OOV how OOV I was about OOV OOV , because we can OOV be OOV whether OOV is OOV and OOV there are OOV .
' What do you OOV , Mr OOV ? ' OOV the OOV .
OOV is the OOV form of transport there is .
It is on the OOV that most OOV OOV .
OOV all OOV of transport , the OOV OOV by far the most OOV and OOV . '
<P> So I am really OOV to welcome this OOV - and I have OOV for it - through which Europe is taking specific action to OOV the very serious OOV OOV by road OOV .
<SPEAKER OOV NAME=" OOV OOV > Madam President , I wish to OOV on this report because it is necessary for the European Union to find a more OOV way to ensure that Member States who make OOV in OOV to OOV of life and OOV actually OOV with those OOV .
<P> The report points out that during the OOV the number of road OOV OOV in the European Union by OOV % .
In OOV , however , the OOV has only been by OOV % .
We have the third OOV OOV OOV in the European Union and we have the OOV OOV OOV in the European Union .
<P> The OOV OOV Council just last OOV OOV that as far as they were concerned they did not see any political OOV to actually OOV OOV with road safety .
It OOV that of the OOV OOV young people who OOV the OOV OOV OOV in OOV 2000 within OOV years OOV would be OOV in OOV OOV OOV .
This OOV to me to be a OOV situation and quite OOV should not be OOV by the European Union .
If Member States make OOV to OOV the OOV which OOV life and OOV than we have to find OOV of OOV that they OOV with those OOV .
<SPEAKER OOV LANGUAGE="FR" NAME=" OOV " > OOV are OOV Mrs OOV OOV on OOV OOV , OOV and OOV work .
OOV safety is indeed a serious area in which we cannot OOV to OOV in OOV and OOV , which the rapporteur OOV OOV .
<P> There are some Members in this House who will take OOV of this issue to OOV that the principle of OOV be OOV , OOV Member States to OOV road safety decisions as they wish .
I , however , OOV the rapporteur ' s opinion as , OOV OOV the OOV position of the OOV in this area , OOV OOV OOV that this is an area where responsibility is OOV between Community , national , regional and local authorities .
The great OOV between Member States , particularly with regard to OOV OOV and OOV ' OOV OOV OOV , do OOV to OOV the number of OOV on the OOV of Europe .
OOV the European Union , road OOV are the number one OOV of OOV in OOV and OOV under OOV .
<P> I , therefore , like the rapporteur , consider it OOV that the Commission does not OOV itself to a OOV on OOV OOV , but OOV a clear OOV at OOV OOV .
OOV , OOV support must be given to the European OOV programme for new OOV OOV ( OOV ) .
This could be OOV , OOV , in the form of a proposal for a directive .
In the same way , we must consider OOV the OOV OOV between the environment and road safety ( OOV us , for example , to OOV road OOV and OOV to make them OOV ) .
<P> We must all OOV our OOV , and that is what the rapporteur OOV out to do in this initiative which does OOV great OOV .
I shall therefore vote in favour of this report .
<SPEAKER OOV NAME=" OOV " > I would like to OOV OOV OOV for OOV very OOV report on a subject that is of great concern to all of us .
The OOV are quite OOV : OOV OOV on the OOV s OOV every year , an OOV OOV million people OOV to one OOV or another .
<P> It is clear that this issue OOV the OOV efforts of all concerned : EU , national and local authorities , as well as the many OOV organisations and OOV which OOV to OOV the problem of OOV OOV .
<P> The number of OOV OOV OOV OOV from one Member State to another OOV from OOV to OOV OOV million with an EU OOV of OOV .
In my own country , OOV , there are OOV OOV OOV million OOV OOV on the OOV each year .
I find particularly OOV the fact that road OOV are the most common OOV of OOV OOV OOV and people under OOV years of OOV in the OOV
<P> This is an OOV situation .
The OOV OOV clearly that the number of OOV OOV can be OOV OOV OOV the OOV
It is OOV that our OOV to OOV OOV on the OOV , in particular those of our young people , is not just a OOV .
There must be OOV resources OOV into OOV OOV at Union level so as to help OOV Member States improve their OOV safety OOV .
<P> At present the Commission ' s road safety OOV is EUR OOV million OOV year .
I believe that the Commission needs to OOV out a OOV OOV of its OOV to OOV road OOV .
I would call on the Commission to increase OOV the road safety OOV and indeed to OOV Member States to OOV OOV .
<P> OOV OOV on OOV road OOV is OOV well OOV .
OOV road safety costs society and the Member States a great deal of OOV .
The human OOV is OOV , but OOV have been made to OOV the OOV , and these OOV that the OOV economic OOV of OOV OOV in the form of OOV and OOV OOV , OOV to OOV and OOV of OOV OOV to about EUR OOV OOV OOV OOV .
<P> OOV are certainly OOV in the right OOV .
OOV the OOV , the number of road OOV in the EU OOV by OOV % .
This OOV must now be OOV and OOV .
<P> Parliament has OOV OOV that one of the major political OOV of transport policy is to give priority to measures to improve safety for all OOV of transport , as well as OOV the necessary financial resources for this OOV .
The number of OOV and OOV on Europe ' s OOV is not something which is OOV .
We must make OOV road safety a political priority and provide the financial means to OOV .
<SPEAKER OOV LANGUAGE="FR" NAME=" OOV " > OOV OOV is in agreement in OOV the OOV number of road OOV in the various European Member States , the OOV Group is OOV to agree OOV with OOV OOV OOV s report on the appropriate means to OOV the subject , for the OOV cannot be OOV more European OOV , more OOV and more OOV .
This OOV , which has already been OOV in OOV OOV in a number of countries , has OOV OOV .
<P> On the other hand , OOV OOV measures with specific national OOV would OOV to be an OOV OOV OOV if we want to achieve positive OOV results .
<P> The means of transport that the OOV OOV , with all it OOV , is more a matter of OOV , OOV and OOV .
So how is it therefore possible to find OOV OOV for the whole of Europe ?
<P> In our view , OOV OOV OOV s report OOV the very OOV of the OOV we OOV to OOV , not out of OOV but in order to be as OOV as possible OOV OOV OOV ' s OOV , all in the interests of our various OOV .
<P> What OOV are we at with the implementation of real OOV , the OOV of OOV that OOV OOV OOV ?
OOV in OOV ( for example , OOV OOV for OOV OOV OOV , or OOV OOV in OOV OOV ) , OOV of the OOV and OOV safety OOV right from the OOV of the OOV by means of OOV OOV to OOV OOV , or even the OOV of the infrastructure by OOV OOV the OOV OOV ' , are the real issues of any OOV road safety policy .
OOV , of course , this is OOV more difficult than OOV a OOV OOV approach , which OOV , for example , OOV a OOV OOV in an OOV OOV OOV , at the end of a OOV OOV OOV to a OOV OOV .
<SPEAKER OOV NAME=" OOV " > I OOV support the report by my OOV OOV which OOV for new measures to OOV road OOV and OOV road safety in Europe .
<P> OOV OOV OOV the OOV of the problem .
It is OOV OOV that as many as OOV people are OOV and over OOV million OOV on OOV OOV the European Union every year .
<P> OOV course , the OOV OOV from country to country .
In OOV and OOV , there are as many as OOV and OOV OOV OOV million , OOV at the OOV end of the OOV , there are OOV and OOV OOV OOV million in OOV in the OOV OOV .
OOV OOV OOV is one too many .
OOV case is an OOV OOV which OOV OOV a OOV .
<P> We OOV need to improve road safety with safety OOV in OOV , OOV OOV OOV and better road OOV .
The OOV Government in OOV is at the OOV , OOV a OOV against OOV .
The OOV of all our citizens , especially our young people , are too OOV to take for OOV .
<P> OOV OOV OOV ( OOV ) <SPEAKER OOV LANGUAGE="SV" OOV , OOV , OOV OOV , OOV and OOV " > OOV OOV OOV are the most common OOV of OOV OOV OOV and OOV under the OOV of OOV in the EU , which OOV the problem a major public health issue .
In OOV , OOV OOV ' has been OOV OOV by Parliament as an OOV OOV of the work on road safety .
However , in order for these road safety OOV to be OOV , OOV OOV are OOV for meeting the OOV .
OOV OOV OOV , including OOV OOV , OOV OOV OOV OOV OOV OOV , OOV OOV , OOV OOV OOV and OOV OOV in OOV where OOV may be OOV , is what is OOV in the OOV OOV to OOV down the number of OOV on the OOV .
In order for the OOV of OOV road OOV to be OOV , more use must be made of public transport so as to OOV the number of OOV on the road .
<P> We will support the report in the OOV vote , but we take the view that the efforts towards OOV are OOV .
The report is a OOV initiative , the main OOV of which is to OOV proposals for the OOV of road safety at EU level .
We consider this OOV to increase road safety to be all well and good , but this is not an issue in which the EU should be OOV resources .
OOV , it is an issue which is best OOV with at Member State level .
<SPEAKER OOV OOV " NAME=" OOV " > Madam President , back in my OOV on the OOV , I OOV OOV to the OOV OOV next to me - a OOV OOV OOV OOV - and at one point he OOV that we were OOV over OOV .
I OOV out of the OOV and OOV the OOV .
OOV to it are some OOV OOV , OOV even from that great OOV .
I OOV my OOV what they were , and he OOV me that they are a OOV for OOV and OOV OOV ' That is an OOV OOV , ' he said .
' These OOV transport OOV are very OOV because OOV has to be OOV in those OOV , so that transport is better , OOV and OOV . '
That is why I OOV for this report .
<SPEAKER OOV LANGUAGE="DE " OOV " > Madam President , I OOV to OOV that I particularly OOV for the OOV OOV report because OOV No OOV was adopted .
This OOV OOV the concern OOV about OOV in OOV the OOV rail OOV and rail OOV .
This is an issue of particular importance for the OOV region , from which I come , and especially so in the case of the OOV OOV OOV .
We hope that as a result of Parliament 's OOV vote , the Commission will regard itself as being OOV to further OOV up the OOV OOV work and to OOV OOV with greater OOV and OOV than has been the case up to now , so as to OOV this OOV problem for the OOV region .
<P> OOV OOV OOV ( OOV ) <SPEAKER OOV OOV " NAME=" OOV " > Madam President , on the very OOV OOV between OOV and OOV I was OOV next to OOV OOV again , and we were OOV about OOV OOV .
OOV OOV OOV me he OOV it was right for OOV , as a OOV , to have to OOV to use the OOV , OOV OOV to the OOV and OOV of an important OOV of transport infrastructure , but that it would be good if people who were still working did not have to OOV a OOV .
<P> So , in OOV for this OOV , I am OOV for a OOV to be made between those OOV the road for work and those OOV it in their OOV time .
The OOV should not have to OOV as much as the OOV .
<SPEAKER OOV NAME=" OOV , OOV > The report adopted in committee OOV a very OOV OOV between those who wish to OOV OOV to OOV on the common transport OOV framework with OOV measures and those who feel that public opinion is not OOV for such a OOV OOV of the way society OOV for the use of its transport infrastructure .
<P> The rapporteur is OOV with the OOV agreement on the OOV OOV OOV in the report , OOV that the Community is OOV to OOV a common OOV for OOV transport costs ; that OOV costs should be OOV in such OOV ; that OOV should be OOV to OOV environmental OOV and OOV OOV OOV to less OOV transport OOV ; that implementation should be OOV by OOV ; that the OOV and OOV OOV in OOV to use ; and that OOV should be made for the less OOV OOV of society and those OOV in OOV areas .
<P> For these OOV , OOV I am OOV to many of the amendments OOV by the Group of the OOV OOV OOV for OOV measures , I cannot support them here , since they would OOV the OOV on the OOV OOV and can be OOV OOV in the course of the implementation of a OOV framework .
<SPEAKER OOV LANGUAGE="FR" NAME=" OOV " > As OOV , the at first OOV OOV OOV of a European Parliament report OOV out to OOV the OOV .
<P> In this case , the matter is OOV for transport infrastructure .
You have to OOV between the OOV , OOV , to see OOV what it is OOV about and if you do so , you come OOV two of the OOV OOV of this OOV : the OOV of an environment OOV and the OOV OOV on road transport and the OOV .
The one main OOV OOV at in the report is to OOV yet more OOV on the road OOV , who are already OOV like Europe ' s OOV OOV , and OOV even to OOV OOV OOV and OOV for the use of the main OOV or OOV OOV .
What OOV do we think we are on ?
<P> OOV the OOV of OOV is OOV , at OOV to OOV OOV the OOV OOV OOV because more than OOV % of the OOV is made up of OOV , you might well think that the road OOV is already OOV more than enough for the right to use the public road OOV in OOV to the use he OOV of his OOV .
That is without OOV all the other OOV of road OOV ; it is too long a OOV and the OOV of OOV involved is too OOV .
<P> OOV , after OOV this report , one OOV just what the OOV we OOV are actually used for .
OOV , OOV , since in OOV , for example , the OOV ' s OOV OOV OOV the national OOV does not OOV it to ensure the safety of the people , to achieve general OOV , to OOV their quality of life or to provide a OOV and OOV transport policy .
<P> The state , the States , should think OOV of the way they use our OOV before OOV OOV any OOV of OOV to OOV make the situation OOV .
<SPEAKER OOV LANGUAGE="FR" OOV > I OOV the report ' s OOV approach , which OOV the need to take the OOV costs of OOV into greater OOV .
OOV , infrastructure needs to be OOV OOV and OOV .
<P> But what OOV must be OOV ?
The report OOV that OOV must OOV the development of the market in Member States , OOV OOV . that OOV OOV must not be made use of .
The social OOV OOV by the road industry or the OOV OOV OOV OOV , for example , are not OOV in any way .
<P> OOV OOV to increase OOV also OOV OOV state OOV so as not to OOV the OOV OOV of OOV .
On the OOV , the rapporteur OOV OOV " the OOV of OOV out OOV of OOV between Member States " .
OOV does the report make any OOV to a state OOV to social needs , yet , on the other hand , the only OOV to the " all market " OOV is to OOV to OOV OOV , for both the OOV and the management of infrastructure .
<P> As a result , the only parties to OOV that are clearly OOV in the OOV are road OOV , and that is why I shall not be OOV in favour of this report .
<P> OOV OOV ( OOV ) <SPEAKER OOV OOV " NAME=" OOV " > We agree with some of the OOV of the report , OOV with the need to OOV transport infrastructure for environmental OOV and the OOV and OOV of the right of all citizens to OOV and OOV to public transport services , although we think that these points should OOV in greater OOV in the resolution as a whole .
<P> OOV , we can only OOV the OOV of Community OOV that OOV all OOV of transport OOV , taking no account of the various OOV of infrastructure that OOV OOV in the Member States .
<P> For these OOV , we will not be able to vote for the report .
<SPEAKER OOV LANGUAGE="DE " NAME=" OOV " > We OOV must OOV a system that OOV to a OOV in the principle of OOV OOV for transport OOV .
This resolution is an important OOV , and OOV on the Commission to present some OOV proposals at long last .
<P> OOV problems can only be OOV on the basis of a European OOV .
As a OOV of a country that has to OOV with the OOV problems of OOV in OOV through the OOV , I call on the European Union to OOV more attention to this subject than it has to OOV .
The Union has not yet OOV OOV its responsibility in this area .
<P> OOV OOV between transport OOV is only possible if OOV costs are also OOV in OOV .
It is OOV for OOV and OOV OOV to be OOV in this OOV system , for the OOV of both the environment and the public .
<SPEAKER OOV LANGUAGE="SV" NAME=" OOV " > In the OOV of the OOV of OOV and democracy , I find it OOV to OOV the OOV that the European Union should be given its own right of OOV .
This OOV also to the field of transport .
<P> These proposals would , OOV to the OOV of the OOV Government , increase the OOV of OOV by a further OOV OOV OOV and the OOV of OOV by OOV OOV OOV , as well as OOV the OOV of OOV for OOV and OOV OOV OOV by OOV OOV OOV OOV .
<P> The OOV of this for OOV Swedish OOV which have already been OOV , such as OOV with its high OOV of OOV OOV and OOV OOV in OOV , are OOV and OOV OOV .
<P> The rapporteur OOV to OOV new Government OOV and EU OOV , and also OOV on OOV , OOV and OOV , OOV OOV , OOV and OOV , OOV and OOV .
OOV of the funds OOV would go to the OOV of the Member States and then be OOV for OOV in infrastructure , and part would go to the Commission to use as it OOV OOV .
<P> OOV the resolution be OOV by the European Parliament and the Council of OOV , the EU would be given its own OOV OOV of OOV , as in an OOV OOV state .
That is a development to which the Swedish OOV OOV do not wish to OOV .
<P> I take a very serious view of further OOV the costs of transport for people and OOV .
It is OOV OOV that this will be a OOV OOV which will OOV OOV on the OOV OOV .
OOV , it is OOV in OOV with the OOV of the European Community to make it more difficult and OOV more OOV for people to OOV each other in and between the various countries .
<SPEAKER OOV OOV " NAME=" OOV " > Madam President , there is a OOV of OOV about OOV in Mrs OOV ' s report .
I have OOV , and this is why .
I have been national OOV of the OOV ' OOV in OOV since OOV , and OOV that time people have been OOV why I OOV the OOV ' OOV when I am not a OOV .
They say I am too young to be OOV , which is very OOV , but it often OOV me that people should think OOV who is not OOV might not be able to OOV up for OOV .
<P> Madam President , do you think not being OOV means I cannot OOV OOV with OOV , OOV and OOV ?
So does not being a OOV OOV a OOV cannot OOV the rights of women just as well ?
That is why I am not so OOV on OOV .
<SPEAKER OOV LANGUAGE="DE " NAME=" OOV , OOV " > Madam President , a OOV of the Group of the European OOV 's OOV ( OOV OOV ) and the European OOV OOV against the OOV report .
This OOV could be OOV or even OOV against us to OOV political points .
We are not , of course , OOV to OOV OOV policy and we are certainly not against women 's OOV .
We agree with the OOV OOV by Commissioner OOV at the end of this OOV 's debate .
We are in favour of OOV measures in OOV , in public OOV , in education , OOV and OOV .
We are in favour of OOV up political OOV and we need European OOV such as OOV .
We are also in favour of OOV OOV and measures being OOV in the EU Member States .
We have OOV this in countries where OOV OOV and OOV are in OOV .
OOV are OOV OOV OOV OOV in our parties .
For example , in OOV , my own OOV , the OOV has a OOV OOV and in the Group of the European OOV 's OOV ( OOV OOV ) and the European OOV a OOV number of the national OOV are OOV by women .
So there is no OOV that we support the OOV of OOV OOV , and this was also OOV from the OOV that my OOV OOV and I made this OOV .
<P> However , the rapporteur , Mrs OOV , and OOV OOV Group were not OOV to support our amendments OOV the OOV of OOV OOV Europe .
There are various different systems in the EU Member States for OOV that women are OOV OOV OOV OOV .
OOV , OOV to what OOV in the report , these are not OOV down by OOV , but by the parties , when they are OOV up their OOV .
That is the way it should OOV - that is what the principle of OOV is all about .
So any OOV to make out that my group , because a OOV of its Members OOV against the OOV report , is in some way OOV to OOV OOV of OOV and women in the OOV process , any such OOV is certainly OOV to OOV .
Madam President , it is not only necessary for the OOV OOV of OOV and OOV to be right - OOV all the OOV must also be right .
<SPEAKER OOV LANGUAGE="FR" NAME=" OOV , OOV and OOV " > We of course OOV against the OOV OOV which OOV OOV the report ' s proposal that the OOV of women , or of OOV , in OOV OOV should be at least OOV % as OOV .
<P> We OOV in favour of this OOV OOV in the OOV report even OOV we are OOV that OOV are no OOV , far from it , to the OOV which women OOV both in OOV OOV and , much more , in society in general .
<SPEAKER OOV NAME=" OOV > I OOV in favour of the OOV report .
OOV and OOV to this debate OOV us that some of our OOV OOV are OOV .
<P> OOV still OOV , and it still OOV women with OOV in their OOV " to make it through the OOV system of OOV OOV and OOV through in political , trade and other organisations .
<P> OOV action is still necessary - OOV real OOV OOV , not just where great OOV is present , but also for those who are less OOV .
<P> OOV are OOV OOV where decisions are made .
<SPEAKER OOV OOV NAME=" OOV " > At the start of the third OOV , women are still OOV for the right , on OOV at least , to OOV in the OOV system , a right which OOV OOV them at the OOV of the OOV .
The OOV OOV of OOV OOV the problem of the OOV of OOV by women in the OOV process not OOV as a problem of democracy ; it is a OOV of social OOV and OOV of the OOV , which is why it OOV OOV working OOV women .
<P> The OOV interest in democracy in the OOV OOV in the OOV for a resolution is in fact an interest in OOV full employment ( the OOV OOV OOV as much ) , and OOV and OOV OOV services .
OOV , OOV OOV OOV OOV and various EU programmes have OOV to be OOV more than the means to OOV OOV OOV .
They OOV to OOV the OOV OOV and to OOV social services to the OOV , OOV OOV at the working OOV and OOV the situation of women in OOV and , as a result , they are responsible for OOV women from the OOV .
<P> OOV will only OOV their OOV place both in the OOV and in political and economic life by OOV the OOV OOV OOV OOV to OOV the OOV responsible for their OOV .
OOV OOV by women cannot be OOV with OOV for their OOV in OOV which OOV against their interests and OOV OOV work , the OOV of health , OOV and education , OOV working OOV and a OOV OOV OOV .
<P> We OOV with the OOV of OOV on political parties because they are organisations which people OOV OOV and they OOV have the right to OOV on their OOV and how they OOV .
OOV OOV OOV on political parties is to OOV in their OOV OOV and OOV on the OOV will of a political OOV .
<P> We shall not OOV OOV measures to improve the OOV of women in the OOV process , OOV that they are OOV by the OOV OOV policy and can therefore OOV OOV OOV to the OOV of women .
OOV measures not OOV by such a policy give OOV to OOV and are OOV , which is why we cannot support OOV measures of an OOV OOV , as OOV in the resolution .
<P> These were the OOV why the OOV OOV of OOV OOV from the vote .
<SPEAKER OOV LANGUAGE="FR" OOV > I shall vote in favour of the report because it has the OOV of once more OOV a OOV problem OOV the OOV of women in political life .
The report , quite OOV , points out that education is an OOV OOV in OOV OOV and in OOV OOV for OOV of both OOV from the OOV OOV .
<P> However , two OOV which I think OOV are OOV .
The first is the economic situation : as long as women are the OOV OOV of an economic system which OOV them into OOV work , OOV OOV and OOV OOV , to OOV them to get involved in political life will OOV a OOV hope .
<P> The second is the political situation : the report could at least put forward rules for OOV OOV which OOV new people to be OOV in each OOV OOV OOV OOV a OOV in OOV which would favour the OOV of more women .
OOV , there should be a OOV on OOV more than one OOV , and there could be a time OOV on OOV OOV .
<P> OOV OOV ( OOV ) <SPEAKER OOV OOV " NAME=" OOV " > Madam President , last OOV I OOV to see a OOV who OOV in a OOV in the OOV OOV .
OOV OOV is OOV OOV and he is a OOV .
OOV OOV me he OOV a OOV of time on his own up the OOV , OOV in the OOV , OOV at OOV because OOV that is OOV by the full OOV OOV better in the OOV - but I have always OOV that .
' I do feel very OOV , ' he said .
' But now that the European Parliament is OOV to OOV OOV OOV , OOV OOV the President of Parliament , as a OOV of all of you , that I will feel that the European Parliament is OOV to me in my OOV ' s work .
OOV at OOV , by the full OOV , it will be as if Mrs OOV is with me to OOV me OOV , and then my work will be OOV . '
<SPEAKER OOV OOV NAME=" OOV " > The OOV report on OOV and OOV OOV is a OOV in the right OOV , OOV as it does to OOV the OOV of OOV OOV and OOV OOV and OOV OOV for European OOV .
It is particularly important in this OOV to : <P> OOV OOV OOV within the framework of OOV development ; <P> ensure that OOV resources are OOV ; <P> OOV a OOV OOV and OOV the various Community OOV which OOV it ; <P> OOV OOV and OOV OOV OOV for OOV OOV , such as OOV OOV .
<P> OOV importance should be OOV to OOV in the Mediterranean and the OOV which OOV OOV OOV OOV and which are now in OOV of OOV .
That is why we need OOV Community action programmes for OOV in the Mediterranean and the OOV .
<SPEAKER OOV OOV " NAME=" OOV " > The OOV report has not OOV our support for a OOV of OOV .
<P> For one , the Commission and rapporteur OOV OOV OOV in the OOV sector to OOV OOV OOV OOV .
That , however , is not OOV .
OOV of all , in this way , Mr OOV does not OOV OOV attention to OOV , OOV OOV OOV can OOV OOV to OOV .
It is therefore OOV to OOV a OOV OOV of OOV .
The OOV OOV OOV an important role in this , but is often OOV to the OOV of OOV market OOV .
It is therefore necessary to OOV market OOV .
It is OOV that the report does not take this OOV into OOV .
<P> OOV , the report OOV OOV the need to OOV OOV .
OOV OOV is not a OOV OOV of energy , because OOV and other OOV OOV are OOV in the process .
OOV OOV OOV OOV OOV and OOV .
<P> OOV , it is OOV whether OOV could be used as OOV OOV in order to achieve the OOV OOV OOV .
OOV all , OOV OOV must also be OOV as a OOV of OOV .
<P> OOV , the rapporteur does not do OOV to the principle of OOV when he OOV for Community action in the field of education , OOV and resources for the Commission .
<P> OOV within and OOV the EU , OOV is a OOV in OOV which is OOV in importance .
It therefore OOV more of a OOV than OOV by the rapporteur .
<P> ( The OOV was OOV at OOV OOV and OOV at OOV OOV ) <SPEAKER OOV LANGUAGE="FR" NAME=" OOV " > Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I should like to OOV on the subject of this OOV ' s OOV .
<P> This OOV , the President OOV OOV to OOV OOV Mr OOV s report .
I agreed , as rapporteur on the subject of OOV OOV , to having my report OOV at OOV OOV this OOV .
OOV then , however , I have OOV OOV from a great number of OOV who OOV to take part in this debate .
The OOV of the Committee on OOV ' OOV and Rights , OOV and OOV OOV , Mr OOV , OOV as he will be OOV to OOV .
I also OOV OOV from Mr OOV , OOV for the OOV Group , Mrs OOV OOV OOV , OOV for the OOV Group , and from Mr OOV OOV , who were OOV to OOV this OOV .
There are other Members , too , in OOV the same position .
<P> I feel that the OOV of these Members who were down to OOV on a report which was one of the OOV of the OOV Presidency means that we cannot have the OOV debate which we OOV to have on a subject on which Parliament must be OOV before the Council may OOV .
In my OOV as rapporteur and on behalf of the OOV Group , I am therefore OOV , Mr President , that my report be OOV OOV a OOV OOV .
<SPEAKER OOV LANGUAGE="DE " NAME=" OOV " > Mr President , I cannot agree with Mr OOV .
I have some OOV with your OOV , Mr OOV , but we only agreed the OOV at the OOV of the OOV , and Mr OOV 's OOV this OOV were OOV .
OOV OOV that his report had been on this OOV 's OOV .
OOV the OOV .
It OOV the debate as OOV from OOV OOV to OOV OOV , and his report was at the end of the OOV with the OOV report .
In other words , it was clear from the OOV that the OOV and OOV reports would be OOV and OOV on this OOV , and I have made my own OOV OOV , and I wish to OOV on this .
The President also said this OOV that the vote would take place at OOV OOV OOV of at OOV OOV , and the debate on OOV and OOV OOV of major importance would end at OOV OOV
That means that we have OOV an OOV to consider this OOV .
I am OOV of the Committee on OOV ' OOV and Rights , OOV and OOV OOV , and I can OOV you that if our OOV are not here , I am quite OOV to use all their OOV time and to state my OOV on the OOV report , which is excellent .
<SPEAKER OOV NAME=" President " > Mr OOV , that is an OOV of an OOV of OOV OOV OOV during the debate on the OOV report .
<SPEAKER OOV LANGUAGE="DE " NAME=" OOV " > Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , Mr OOV 's last OOV , his OOV to OOV for OOV OOV OOV about the OOV report , really is an OOV for OOV the report at this OOV .
However , the OOV problem here is something quite different .
Mr OOV has in fact said OOV that needs to be said .
What we are OOV here - and we have already OOV this once this OOV , as we also did on OOV and OOV - is , and I shall make no OOV about it , an OOV to OOV OOV OOV as the OOV of Parliament .
OOV like this are OOV of OOV just that .
<P> Mr OOV , even if it would make a OOV contribution if you were to OOV for OOV OOV - and I too could also OOV for OOV OOV , as no one OOV is OOV from my group OOV - in OOV it would OOV that the work Mr OOV has so OOV done would not be OOV in the way it OOV here .
OOV that OOV I can OOV Mr OOV 's OOV that his report , which is OOV on the approach OOV in the committee and which should be OOV here in this OOV , should be given a OOV OOV in the OOV .
So I really am in favour of OOV a report as important as this one , and for my part I would OOV OOV to Mr OOV 's OOV .
<SPEAKER OOV NAME=" President " > We are not OOV into a debate on a OOV point .
We are OOV a proposal , one opinion against , and one in favour .
OOV , OOV on what Mr OOV has said , I have this to say .
Mr OOV , on behalf of your group , you OOV for the debate to be OOV .
OOV we OOV a different opinion from Mr OOV , who OOV to the same group .
But in any case , that is a OOV issue , because under OOV OOV of the OOV of OOV a decision cannot be taken now on a matter like this .
We cannot vote on this point now .
You can OOV and OOV - that is , a political group or at least OOV Members can do so - OOV the debate to another time in Parliament ' s OOV , but only at the OOV of the debate .
You cannot do so now .
You can only present that proposal , on behalf of your group , when the debate OOV at OOV OOV , not now .
<SPEAKER OOV LANGUAGE="FR" NAME=" OOV " > OOV me , Mr President , but OOV in this OOV the OOV should have been the same as for Mr OOV s report this OOV .
This OOV , Mr OOV s report was OOV even OOV , OOV to your OOV of the OOV of OOV , this should not have been OOV .
OOV that it was possible to do this for Mr OOV , I do not , therefore , see why it would not be possible to do so in my case in order to OOV this OOV ' s OOV better .
I am not OOV for a OOV favour , OOV for the OOV of the OOV OOV this OOV .
<SPEAKER OOV NAME=" President " > But I am not OOV this OOV ' s OOV ; I am OOV OOV OOV and , OOV the OOV from Mr OOV and OOV , I am going to OOV it out to you : ' At the start of a debate on an OOV on the OOV , a political group or at least OOV Members may OOV that the debate be OOV to a specific OOV and time .
OOV a OOV shall be put to the vote OOV . '
So , not now , but at OOV OOV OOV OOV OOV OOV OOV OOV <SPEAKER OOV NAME=" President " > The next OOV is the debate on OOV and OOV OOV of major importance .
OOV OOV OOV of OOV OOV OOV in OOV <SPEAKER OOV NAME=" President " > The next OOV is the OOV debate on the following OOV for OOV : <P> OOV by Mr OOV , on behalf of the Group for a Europe of OOV and OOV , on the law on the OOV OOV OOV ; <P> OOV by Mr OOV , on behalf of the Group of the European OOV , OOV and OOV OOV , on the law on the OOV OOV OOV ; <P> OOV by Mrs OOV , Mrs OOV , Mr OOV and Mrs OOV , on behalf of the Group of the OOV OOV OOV , on the law on the OOV OOV OOV ; <P> OOV by Mr OOV and Mr OOV , on behalf of the Group of the European OOV ' s OOV ( OOV OOV ) and European OOV , on the law on the OOV OOV OOV ; <P> OOV by Mrs OOV , Mr OOV OOV OOV , Mr OOV and Mr OOV , on behalf of the Group of the OOV of European OOV , on the international OOV in OOV ; <P> OOV by Mr OOV , Mr OOV OOV and Mr OOV , on behalf of the OOV Group of the European United OOV OOV OOV , on the law on the OOV OOV OOV in OOV .
<SPEAKER OOV OOV " NAME=" OOV " > Mr President , at long last we have a result .
The OOV of the OOV OOV ' s OOV of OOV are being OOV before an OOV " OOV .
We are OOV that the OOV OOV OOV has OOV on this OOV and would like the OOV OOV to be OOV out as OOV as possible .
<P> OOV all , it is OOV , certainly for the OOV and OOV of the OOV , that so far , not one OOV OOV OOV OOV has been OOV for his or OOV OOV and that the OOV of years OOV by are still OOV citizens in OOV , not to OOV the OOV OOV OOV OOV ' OOV in the government .
<P> However , the OOV of the adopted OOV OOV has OOV us to make a number of OOV OOV .
OOV years of OOV between the United OOV and OOV , it is OOV clear that a OOV OOV has been OOV .
It is OOV those legal OOV against which OOV OOV OOV their OOV in a OOV three years OOV , that have now been OOV in the OOV adopted .
The country ' s OOV , which is also OOV , has OOV to OOV every last OOV out of the negotiations in this matter .
<P> OOV OOV from OOV government OOV OOV to OOV that they are OOV to OOV the OOV course of OOV .
The OOV in OOV , Mr OOV OOV , OOV OOV that the OOV principle OOV this OOV was to OOV OOV and peace in the country In other words , OOV OOV OOV OOV OOV OOV could OOV current OOV , need not be OOV to OOV .
OOV OOV too is taking the OOV authorities under his OOV by OOV that " OOV is more important than OOV " .
<P> OOV way of OOV , Mr President , we call on the international OOV and OOV to ensure that the OOV OOV OOV are OOV to OOV in a OOV , OOV and OOV OOV , and to OOV the OOV from OOV into a OOV .
<SPEAKER OOV OOV " NAME=" OOV " > Mr President , I believe Mr OOV has just OOV the OOV on the OOV .
OOV course it is positive that this OOV is now actually about to take place .
It is important for OOV to deal with the OOV from the OOV which are still OOV the country .
However , we are not OOV about what is about to OOV there .
It is a matter of better some of a OOV than OOV of a OOV .
We cannot do much OOV other than go OOV with it .
OOV ' s OOV has given its OOV .
OOV are we then to OOV what is OOV now , but we do have OOV OOV about the way in which this has been OOV .
<P> OOV , every OOV in OOV will have OOV OOV its own OOV .
In this case , the OOV OOV will be OOV by the OOV OOV Council of OOV , which is OOV by the OOV OOV .
OOV OOV can those OOV be ?
It is , of course , possible to OOV international OOV , and they will certainly OOV a role in this , but will this role be so OOV that it will be clear to the OOV OOV OOV that the OOV OOV will actually be OOV and do OOV to the situation as it was then ?
It is , of course , extremely OOV that people such as Mr OOV OOV , who OOV a OOV role under OOV OOV , have already been OOV from the OOV because the OOV OOV OOV them from that OOV , and that was not done by a OOV of OOV but by Mr OOV OOV <P> We are OOV that this OOV is now going to take place , but we will OOV its progress with OOV OOV .
We will only be able to OOV a OOV as to whether what is OOV here is a positive OOV once the OOV OOV are over .
We therefore hope things will go well , but we have major OOV .
<SPEAKER OOV OOV " > Mr President , I very much welcome the OOV of OOV to OOV the OOV of the OOV OOV OOV OOV OOV .
It is important so that OOV can OOV forward into the future that those responsible for OOV OOV against the OOV OOV be OOV to OOV .
<P> The OOV OOV OOV was one of the OOV human rights OOV of the OOV OOV , being responsible for an OOV OOV million OOV in a OOV , OOV OOV .
OOV I welcome the OOV of the OOV I have a number of OOV .
We have to OOV that the OOV of the OOV OOV OOV 's OOV , including the OOV OOV , OOV OOV were once OOV of the OOV OOV , OOV under the OOV OOV OOV .
OOV OOV has already OOV who can and cannot be taken before a OOV , OOV OOV the OOV of any OOV .
There have been OOV OOV that OOV OOV OOV of the OOV might OOV OOV , in particular the OOV OOV OOV OOV OOV , OOV OOV .
OOV was given OOV OOV after he OOV with about OOV OOV in OOV .
<P> OOV OOV and other OOV OOV OOV were OOV to OOV in OOV in OOV by the OOV 's Court , which was OOV by the OOV OOV OOV OOV at the time .
The OOV OOV by OOV OOV OOV only to this OOV and OOV no OOV to future OOV and therefore it is important that he is OOV .
<P> No OOV OOV OOV has OOV been OOV and only two are in OOV , one being the OOV who OOV a OOV OOV OOV in OOV OOV from which only OOV out of more than OOV OOV OOV OOV OOV .
<P> The OOV has an OOV framework for OOV of both international and OOV OOV and OOV .
OOV , in other OOV OOV OOV , there are only OOV OOV and OOV .
This OOV OOV more OOV when we see that OOV the OOV OOV will be OOV by the OOV OOV Council of the OOV , a OOV OOV by the OOV OOV of OOV OOV , the OOV has no OOV OOV to OOV the OOV OOV by OOV .
<P> Finally , we also need to look at the OOV of OOV in all of this .
OOV it has always OOV that it only OOV the OOV OOV with OOV OOV in OOV , the OOV OOV OOV OOV OOV OOV to OOV that it was OOV involved in the OOV up of the OOV and OOV OOV in OOV OOV where OOV of OOV OOV .
<SPEAKER OOV NAME=" OOV " > Mr President , there are people here who are OOV enough not to have OOV the OOV and OOV reports that OOV out of OOV in OOV , with OOV OOV of a OOV OOV as the OOV OOV , their OOV OOV in the OOV OOV of OOV OOV OOV and OOV a OOV of political OOV and OOV OOV , OOV two million people from the OOV to the OOV to OOV a new society in year OOV under the OOV of the OOV " OOV OOV .
The OOV were OOV from the OOV or OOV to OOV .
What OOV was to OOV the world .
The human rights OOV of OOV , OOV , OOV OOV , OOV , OOV are OOV by the OOV OOV of the OOV that OOV place under the OOV OOV .
The OOV OOV of between one and two million people OOV a real OOV .
OOV , to be OOV , we should call it a OOV for the OOV was not to OOV out a OOV but an OOV OOV , with OOV OOV on the basis of whether they were OOV , whether their OOV OOV OOV of OOV work , or even whether they OOV OOV .
<P> It is not OOV therefore that following OOV OOV 's OOV and the OOV of the OOV OOV , there should be a need for some OOV of national OOV through the OOV of OOV and a OOV to account of those responsible .
OOV I hope that the OOV will not be OOV to the OOV OOV OOV but be OOV to those who OOV OOV and OOV their OOV .
If the OOV people want these OOV to OOV , and the political situation is OOV OOV to OOV them , then it is only OOV that the international OOV , through the OOV , should wish to support them in that OOV .
We should OOV , however , of OOV OOV on other OOV , especially if such OOV might OOV a political OOV or OOV that has OOV peace or OOV to the region and OOV a better future .
<P> OOV are OOV necessary if OOV .
In OOV , OOV , it OOV as OOV the people and government are OOV to take the OOV of OOV OOV OOV in order to OOV OOV .
If that OOV to be the case we should wish them well in this OOV .
<SPEAKER OOV OOV NAME=" OOV > Mr President , it is a positive OOV that the OOV law on the OOV of the OOV OOV OOV in OOV has been adopted in the country ' s OOV OOV and that OOV OOV is to OOV it after it has been OOV by the OOV Council .
The form the OOV will take has been agreed between the OOV and the OOV government .
As the OOV OOV system is still OOV , the OOV are to be OOV in such a way that both international and local OOV will be OOV .
OOV the time of the OOV OOV , OOV all those in the country ' s legal OOV were OOV , and the country has not had time to OOV a new OOV OOV OOV system .
<P> The international OOV has been concerned that many of those OOV OOV of OOV will not OOV OOV , OOV the law that OOV the OOV .
This concern is OOV .
OOV who OOV the OOV state so much OOV and its people so much OOV OOV must be OOV OOV responsible for their OOV .
In OOV to this , however , account must be taken of the OOV of OOV and the country ' s future .
OOV OOV I OOV was able to see how OOV people were OOV at OOV , so that life could go on .
It is not always OOV to OOV clearly between the OOV and the OOV .
OOV a OOV of OOV OOV is to be OOV .
<P> OOV OOV ' s problems and its OOV OOV are still OOV to us in terms of time , the country has been able to OOV the OOV of democracy .
OOV is the only country in OOV OOV to have OOV the OOV OOV .
A OOV of OOV who OOV in the region said that at present OOV is the only OOV system in the OOV OOV OOV , although there is still much to do to OOV democracy and the OOV of law .
OOV we OOV welcome the legislation on a OOV , we must give our OOV support to the positive OOV that have OOV in the country .
<SPEAKER OOV LANGUAGE="DE " NAME=" OOV " > Mr President , what we have just OOV is an OOV to OOV the OOV OOV just as OOV 's OOV as been done OOV with , OOV by OOV these OOV and OOV OOV .
However , I would like to say that the subject of OOV very much OOV the importance of our OOV and OOV OOV .
<P> As Mr OOV has quite OOV said , the OOV which OOV place in OOV was often OOV up during the OOV .
No one OOV about OOV .
It was this House which , following its first OOV OOV in OOV , was the first to give OOV OOV a OOV OOV , although it had OOV no OOV at that time .
OOV this House OOV a very OOV interest in the OOV of the people of OOV .
I OOV that in the OOV our OOV OOV OOV OOV , who I was working with at the time , OOV OOV the subject of OOV OOV the OOV .
OOV if the OOV OOV to OOV with the OOV of Europe , they did it through the European Parliament 's OOV on OOV and OOV OOV of major importance , here in OOV .
A OOV who OOV OOV , OOV OOV , a OOV who OOV the difficult OOV between the OOV OOV on the one hand and the OOV OOV OOV on the other , OOV OOV OOV the OOV of a OOV OOV , OOV with the help of the European Union and of the European Parliament .
<P> OOV we have an opportunity to OOV on this , and I am very OOV that the OOV OOV OOV by the OOV OOV will now be OOV OOV .
But it is also very positive - and I would like to say that Mrs OOV is quite right here - that we as the European Union have a OOV to OOV support democracy , the OOV of law and OOV in OOV OOV .
However , this example should make us aware that it is not always a question of OOV OOV or OOV .
This House , thank OOV , now has greater OOV as OOV OOV policy than it had OOV years OOV .
It is a question of OOV those who are OOV of their rights a OOV OOV and that is one of the OOV OOV of this House .
<SPEAKER OOV NAME=" OOV " > Mr President , the Commission has fully OOV the efforts of the United OOV and the OOV authorities in their OOV to achieve an OOV agreement on the OOV OOV OOV .
OOV the OOV year , the Commission OOV , and together with the EU Member States , has OOV on the OOV government to OOV its support for the process OOV up to the agreement on the OOV and has OOV that the OOV should OOV international OOV of OOV , OOV and OOV process .
<P> OOV some OOV in the OOV of the legislation , the OOV law was adopted by the OOV OOV on OOV OOV and by the OOV on OOV OOV .
It is now OOV to be OOV by the OOV Council and OOV OOV OOV .
<P> OOV we welcome the OOV of the legislation OOV the OOV OOV OOV , both by the OOV OOV and by the OOV , it should be OOV in OOV that we are still OOV the OOV OOV from the United OOV on the OOV OOV .
There are OOV that the OOV is not OOV in OOV with what had been agreed with the United OOV .
OOV , the first OOV from the OOV after OOV an OOV OOV , has been OOV positive , and the Commission OOV , therefore , that the OOV OOV issues can be OOV so that the OOV can improve the new OOV and the agreement between the OOV government and the United OOV can be OOV OOV .
<P> OOV other OOV issue which the Commission will OOV OOV is the question of which OOV OOV OOV will be put on OOV .
OOV OOV OOV OOV OOV has given OOV that OOV would be OOV from OOV , he has also OOV that this is a very OOV issue for OOV of the OOV OOV .
In particular , OOV OOV has OOV that OOV could OOV out " if the OOV OOV OOV OOV OOV OOV is put on OOV .
So there are very good OOV why we should OOV this OOV .
<SPEAKER OOV NAME=" President " > The OOV debate is OOV .
<P> The vote will take place this OOV , at OOV OOV OOV OOV OOV OOV between OOV and OOV <SPEAKER OOV NAME=" President " > The next OOV is the OOV debate on the following OOV for OOV : <P> OOV by Mr OOV , on behalf of the Group for a Europe of OOV and OOV , on the OOV OOV in OOV between OOV and OOV ; <P> OOV by Mr OOV , on behalf of the Group of the European OOV , OOV and OOV OOV , on the OOV OOV OOV by the OOV OOV on OOV ; <P> OOV by Mr OOV , Mr OOV , Mrs OOV , Mr OOV , Mr OOV OOV , Mr OOV and Mr OOV , of the OOV Group of OOV Members , on the OOV OOV in OOV ; <P> OOV by Mr OOV , Mr OOV , Mrs OOV and Mrs OOV OOV , on behalf of the Group of the OOV OOV OOV , on the question of OOV between OOV and OOV ; <P> OOV by Mrs OOV and Mr OOV , on behalf of the Group of the European OOV ' s OOV ( OOV OOV ) and European OOV , on the OOV OOV OOV by the OOV OOV on OOV ; <P> OOV by Mr OOV OOV OOV , on behalf of the Group of the OOV of European OOV , on the OOV OOV OOV by the OOV OOV on OOV ; <P> OOV by Mr OOV and Mr OOV , on behalf of the OOV Group of the European United OOV OOV OOV , on the OOV OOV in OOV between OOV and OOV .
<SPEAKER OOV OOV " NAME=" OOV " > Mr President , we can certainly support the OOV of the present resolution .
OOV all , it is a clear OOV from the OOV OOV ' s OOV decision to OOV a OOV OOV on OOV .
The OOV of OOV OOV - OOV for OOV of OOV ' s OOV OOV OOV OOV - OOV further development in our opinion .
OOV , we OOV both parties to OOV the will to OOV into OOV OOV .
<P> OOV more serious , in our opinion , is an OOV in OOV OOV It has a OOV OOV on the very OOV of OOV ' s political OOV .
OOV OOV is right to OOV safety OOV to be put in place for the group of OOV OOV OOV OOV OOV , some of OOV have now OOV to the OOV region of OOV or OOV there on a OOV basis for their work .
The OOV OOV OOV is today in OOV in that region but - OOV in OOV - this is in the OOV of OOV OOV , OOV OOV , who OOV a OOV OOV role .
<P> However , what is OOV in OOV OOV , is a OOV to the OOV group of OOV OOV from OOV who have been on OOV OOV OOV now .
These are an OOV OOV to OOV OOV and OOV OOV , and they are OOV in OOV OOV conditions .
<P> It is OOV this specific OOV problem which OOV a OOV OOV to the OOV of President OOV .
These OOV , the OOV from OOV are OOV the OOV on OOV authorities to OOV their OOV OOV .
In OOV , they are a OOV OOV of OOV in OOV .
A situation which OOV is OOV OOV to OOV by not OOV OOV to OOV a OOV for these OOV .
OOV , various OOV have been OOV under international OOV which the OOV have so far put on OOV .
<P> OOV these and other OOV OOV political OOV in the OOV , we welcome the OOV in OOV OOV - the OOV of a OOV European OOV to this OOV and OOV important region - with open OOV .
A OOV European OOV may have a OOV OOV on this OOV , and what is more , our OOV will OOV OOV OOV OOV with OOV OOV OOV rights .
<SPEAKER OOV LANGUAGE="FR" NAME=" OOV " > Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , we have had to OOV a long time to get this resolution on the OOV .
OOV is a long way OOV , it is OOV , and a few years OOV , the OOV OOV just as far OOV .
We have now OOV the OOV of that situation and just how OOV they are in fact .
<P> I think that , in many OOV , OOV and the OOV as a whole already are today what the OOV were OOV , the OOV of the OOV .
OOV , OOV , OOV , OOV OOV and OOV as a whole are very OOV OOV OOV OOV .
<P> OOV today is a country OOV in the OOV of its OOV OOV , a country being OOV through the OOV OOV , the OOV OOV , the OOV OOV , OOV through OOV , with this OOV OOV between the citizens of OOV OOV and OOV and those of OOV .
This situation is the work of OOV , the new OOV policy OOV by President OOV .
OOV is OOV OOV , OOV is OOV OOV and the European Union , if you will OOV the OOV , does not give a OOV , OOV about OOV , or about this new OOV of conflict at the very OOV to Europe .
<P> No OOV are OOV , although I do not see why it should not be OOV possible , in a European Union which will have OOV million OOV , to have OOV million .
The only OOV which might OOV the whole region , right on OOV ' s OOV , and put a OOV on OOV ' s OOV in this region , the only serious proposal , by which I OOV a proposal that OOV should OOV to the European Union in OOV form , has not been made .
We OOV at least to OOV that the European Union must , as a matter of OOV , OOV OOV .
This OOV is particularly OOV at Commissioner OOV OOV .
<SPEAKER OOV LANGUAGE="FR" NAME=" OOV OOV " > Mr President , Commissioner , he who OOV the OOV shall OOV OOV the OOV .
These words take on their full OOV when OOV to the countries of the OOV OOV .
What region of our own OOV , or the next , is more OOV by OOV and issues ?
What region has a greater need for OOV and OOV ?
The OOV OOV is OOV OOV in the OOV OOV of regional OOV - OOV and OOV , of OOV of interest , and OOV OOV military OOV , from the OOV OOV OOV to the OOV of OOV , or the regions of OOV and OOV OOV .
The region is OOV , OOV in political , economic and energy OOV OOV which continue to OOV only in OOV .
A situation which has OOV now been OOV in a OOV OOV OOV , which may be OOV OOV as the OOV OOV .
At least , OOV was done to OOV the different OOV for OOV in the framework of an OOV OOV OOV agreement .
At least the recent OOV of these three countries , as small OOV as they are OOV OOV , into the Council of Europe could be OOV as a OOV of interest from the OOV of Europe , OOV hope of OOV for the region and a OOV of a more OOV future for these OOV .
<P> OOV , then , is the recent OOV decision by the OOV Government to OOV a OOV OOV for the citizens of OOV to be OOV OOV as OOV OOV OOV economic trade and OOV OOV between the OOV OOV OOV OOV .
OOV is this OOV OOV between the citizens of the same country , which is OOV by the international OOV , the people of OOV , OOV OOV and OOV , to be OOV OOV as OOV OOV OOV OOV the OOV of a OOV state ?
<P> OOV , is a government OOV OOV in the OOV to provide for the OOV of OOV a OOV state , or part OOV , even if there are no OOV ?
These are just so many OOV , OOV OOV in OOV ' s OOV OOV OOV , and just as many OOV for us to use our OOV to OOV our OOV of OOV ' s OOV OOV its OOV OOV state and to take OOV action to OOV the political OOV of this region and its economic OOV , and , of course , to OOV , as the resolution OOV , a OOV OOV for the OOV : since a OOV of OOV in the OOV OOV may indeed OOV Europe OOV .
<SPEAKER OOV LANGUAGE="DE " NAME=" OOV " > Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , the European Parliament 's OOV for relations with the OOV OOV is OOV concerned about the OOV OOV OOV being OOV there .
The OOV OOV of a OOV OOV on OOV , with the OOV of two regions of OOV , will OOV new OOV in a country which is a OOV of the Council of Europe , OOV to OOV OOV , and with which we have OOV an agreement OOV in order to support it in all areas .
<P> These OOV are OOV to OOV with OOV OOV and to OOV OOV for the OOV themselves , some of OOV work in the OOV OOV and are now OOV OOV .
In order to OOV a OOV , they have to OOV back to OOV .
In some OOV they cannot even OOV to do this .
OOV the other OOV is that these OOV will also have economic OOV .
<P> We are very much concerned that because of its OOV OOV the OOV OOV OOV is now at the OOV of OOV interests and has also become a European OOV OOV .
We should not just OOV our OOV about this , we should actually do OOV in our OOV .
We know from our OOV OOV in national OOV and from the OOV , which has OOV us , that they really are in OOV OOV , and that they OOV further OOV , especially as a OOV is being OOV between OOV and OOV , which OOV OOV OOV as greater OOV .
OOV OOV that it will become OOV .
So these are OOV OOV OOV .
At the end of OOV , OOV OOV from OOV to OOV were even OOV on the OOV OOV that OOV had not been made , even OOV the OOV OOV were quite different .
So these are all things which when OOV OOV OOV quite OOV , but which OOV to us that the situation has OOV OOV over the last OOV OOV .
<P> We are therefore OOV the Commission to consider , in OOV with the Council , whether we could not OOV and work out a better approach to these conflict OOV , OOV on appropriate decisions which will help people there who want to OOV a OOV society and OOV a OOV future , and to support OOV in OOV human rights and OOV with the other OOV it has OOV into within the Council of Europe .
<P> It is very OOV in these difficult OOV for OOV to OOV all its current human rights OOV .
That is why we are OOV on the Commission to OOV here .
We have made OOV and have OOV OOV OOV agreement in Parliament that something should be done .
We need to work together to come up with OOV which will OOV a OOV way forward .
<SPEAKER OOV LANGUAGE="DE " NAME=" OOV " > Mr President , I would like to OOV support Mrs OOV , who has OOV with great OOV on behalf of the OOV region and in this case OOV in particular .
We all know what these OOV are about .
On the one hand they are OOV with OOV interests and with energy and OOV interests , and on the other hand they are OOV with the OOV OOV being OOV to OOV the people of OOV .
It is very clear to us what is being OOV here - to OOV OOV , just as OOV has been OOV .
We all have an interest in OOV what is in any case very OOV OOV and in OOV the first OOV OOV towards democracy in this region and in OOV .
<P> That is why I would like to call on the Commissioner to OOV even greater attention to this region .
OOV aid in particular has a OOV OOV OOV in OOV to its OOV OOV OOV .
I am OOV that a OOV from our OOV , the OOV OOV of the Council of Europe , is OOV OOV OOV , and I wish to OOV to the Commissioner to OOV to OOV and OOV in the OOV future and have a OOV look at the human rights situation there on the OOV , just as the Council of Europe is OOV in such a OOV way .
I OOV to the Commissioner to make our OOV aid the number one political priority - the OOV region has been a priority for the OOV and for OOV for a long time .
I say this because I have the OOV that the European Union , OOV from Mrs OOV , who is OOV OOV work , is OOV to take up this OOV .
We must not OOV OOV to OOV the OOV we made with the OOV , where we also OOV up to the situation too OOV , and again OOV OOV by OOV too OOV too OOV .
<SPEAKER OOV NAME=" OOV " > Mr President , I wish to OOV by OOV a few words about OOV OOV to this region .
We are the OOV most important OOV of OOV OOV to the OOV OOV and , over the years , we have also been the main OOV of OOV OOV to the OOV OOV region .
<P> A year OOV OOV I was in OOV OOV and I OOV to get into OOV but the OOV authorities would not OOV this for security OOV .
But we are still there .
<P> OOV now our OOV problem is the OOV of the OOV who OOV for one of the organisations we are OOV in OOV .
This , of course , has OOV a great deal of concern .
The OOV OOV was to OOV from OOV .
However , many organisations in OOV have OOV us to OOV this and to come back .
As a OOV OOV this OOV us in a OOV .
On the one hand , we need to be there , and we are very OOV that Parliament OOV the need for OOV to OOV on the basis of a OOV OOV OOV " in these OOV .
On the other hand , OOV it is a OOV too OOV for us to OOV the organisations we are OOV to go there - it is the OOV OOV who have to go .
We have to find a OOV that is OOV OOV as a OOV .
At the OOV we are OOV whether or not to go back to OOV , as we are OOV there .
<P> OOV me OOV to OOV .
The EU has already OOV serious concern over the OOV OOV 's OOV decision to OOV OOV OOV for OOV citizens .
The OOV international OOV , including OOV , is OOV to OOV the OOV and OOV OOV of the OOV OOV .
OOV a OOV OOV OOV or OOV OOV for the OOV of OOV regions could OOV support for the OOV of their OOV and OOV OOV 's OOV and OOV OOV .
<P> In OOV to the OOV of OOV OOV , OOV has OOV a number of other OOV in its relations with OOV in recent OOV , in particular , over OOV in OOV OOV , the OOV of OOV of military OOV and OOV OOV with the OOV OOV .
<P> OOV OOV OOV OOV to OOV , we OOV that all OOV are OOV OOV on OOV and OOV OOV .
I want to OOV that it is in OOV 's interests to be OOV as an OOV OOV and OOV OOV OOV .
I say this as a European .
<P> We are OOV concerned about the OOV , social and economic OOV for the OOV people , as well as the OOV OOV in the OOV .
OOV too has no interest in OOV OOV OOV in the OOV .
<P> OOV is a OOV of the OOV , the OOV and the Council of Europe and it has a OOV and cooperation agreement with the OOV
It OOV our support .
We call upon the OOV of the region to use the OOV of the OOV , as well as any other appropriate OOV OOV , to OOV that OOV OOV .
<SPEAKER OOV NAME=" President " > The OOV debate is OOV .
<P> The vote will take place this OOV at OOV OOV OOV OOV OOV rights <SPEAKER OOV NAME=" President " > The next OOV is the OOV debate on the following OOV for OOV : <P> OOV in OOV OOV - OOV by Mr OOV , on behalf of the Group of the European OOV , OOV and OOV OOV , on the situation in OOV OOV ; <P> OOV by Mr OOV and Mr OOV , on behalf of the Group of the OOV OOV OOV , on the situation in OOV OOV ; <P> OOV by Mr OOV OOV , on behalf of the Group of the European OOV ' s OOV ( OOV OOV ) and European OOV , on the situation in OOV OOV ; <P> OOV by Mr OOV OOV OOV , Mr OOV , Mr OOV and Mr OOV , on behalf of the Group of the OOV of European OOV , on the OOV by the OOV government to end the OOV OOV in its OOV ; <P> OOV by Mrs OOV , Mrs OOV , Mrs OOV , Mr OOV , Mr OOV , Mr OOV , Mr OOV , Mr OOV , Mrs OOV , Mr OOV and Mr OOV , on behalf of the OOV Group of the European United OOV OOV OOV , on OOV OOV .

<P> We are well aware that the situation in OOV OOV means we cannot OOV the OOV and OOV of certain OOV and the fact that , in some OOV , the OOV authorities had OOV OOV of whole OOV of the OOV , as well as the OOV reports from various OOV OOV of OOV OOV of OOV who have OOV to OOV themselves from the organisations they OOV to , and OOV being OOV to OOV which OOV are to OOV OOV OOV .
But it has been OOV that the OOV government is OOV of OOV peace and security in the OOV without the OOV and OOV use of OOV , so it is the OOV government that OOV OOV responsibility for what has OOV and it must find the OOV for it .
The OOV cannot be OOV OOV and OOV about security .
It is the OOV government ' s OOV to OOV an already OOV situation taking OOV and OOV into OOV OOV , OOV and OOV OOV and OOV OOV and parties .
It is up to the government to OOV .
<P> OOV the European Union , like all of us , has a OOV interest in a process of OOV and peace , and we hope it will be OOV .
We have the clear OOV to report and OOV any progress towards greater respect for human rights in OOV , which is why our group OOV OOV the OOV of OOV a OOV into the OOV OOV as OOV as possible .
<SPEAKER OOV OOV OOV " > Mr President , the recent OOV in OOV OOV are OOV by any OOV and it is an OOV OOV that the situation had been OOV to OOV over such a long OOV with the OOV OOV OOV .
<P> However , these OOV must be put in OOV and we should OOV the OOV of the OOV authorities to OOV a more human , OOV , and indeed OOV , OOV OOV .
As relations between the European Union and OOV OOV in an OOV positive OOV , we need to take a OOV approach in our OOV on OOV 's problems .
At the same time our OOV with the OOV authorities should be OOV OOV that we can make OOV OOV .
<P> I have to say that in the United OOV in the OOV we too have had OOV in OOV the right OOV OOV for those OOV or OOV for OOV OOV .
We too have had OOV where OOV have more or less had OOV OOV over their OOV and OOV areas and we too have had to deal with the OOV of OOV OOV .
It is not OOV .
The OOV themselves take on OOV OOV .
The situation in the OOV OOV yet another OOV of the OOV OOV against the OOV government .
We should OOV this OOV in OOV .
<P> OOV to the resolution itself we OOV OOV recent OOV but my OOV is that we should be more OOV and OOV OOV the OOV OOV by the OOV Government .
OOV all OOV is OOV to the OOV that we OOV upon OOV to OOV OOV OOV more into OOV with European systems .
We should OOV that many of the OOV are OOV who will OOV OOV OOV of OOV of their situation .
OOV course a OOV OOV must be OOV and there must be OOV to OOV OOV to OOV OOV OOV .
This is in OOV 's interests but we cannot OOV OOV to OOV with OOV over their conditions and OOV .
<P> The current problems OOV because the OOV OOV were not OOV to OOV OOV over the OOV to the authorities .
The OOV by the security OOV is not the OOV but the OOV of the problem .
The OOV security OOV had to OOV the OOV by OOV OOV OOV OOV OOV and the OOV of many OOV is not clear OOV of course every OOV is a OOV .
<P> I know that the OOV authorities are OOV OOV by recent OOV .
They are also OOV OOV to OOV and open to OOV cooperation with the Commission and with the Union and its Member States on OOV of the OOV system .
They see this as part of the OOV process of OOV the OOV .
<P> We should OOV OOV our concern at what has OOV and that the situation was OOV to OOV so far .
OOV us now OOV all possible OOV OOV and OOV and OOV OOV OOV without OOV further OOV to OOV OOV who OOV to OOV the OOV Government and OOV OOV 's progress towards OOV of the European Union .
<SPEAKER OOV OOV OOV " > Mr President , I would say to Mr OOV OOV : you had to OOV your own OOV political OOV OOV with military OOV .
I OOV the OOV on the OOV .
These are problems which cannot be OOV by OOV but only by political OOV .
<P> Mr President , today 's debate and OOV vote OOV on from the debate which we OOV in this House on OOV OOV last year , when the OOV vote was OOV following the decision by the three political OOV to OOV their OOV .
That decision was a OOV of OOV on the part of the European Parliament in the will and the OOV of the OOV authorities to OOV the OOV OOV OOV in a OOV , OOV and OOV OOV .
<P> In fact , the OOV for a resolution by our OOV OOV in the OOV group , which is OOV by the OOV Mr OOV , OOV that Parliament is OOV with the OOV government 's decision to OOV its OOV to OOV OOV to these OOV and to OOV the society 's OOV to the OOV of the OOV system .
OOV OOV were OOV in the resolution of the group of the OOV OOV by Mr OOV , which OOV OOV made by the OOV OOV of OOV .
<P> OOV OOV may have been OOV over by the OOV set out in the OOV on the matter from OOV OOV the OOV of OOV , who again did us the OOV of OOV us what is now his OOV OOV in such OOV , in which he OOV that the OOV government was OOV the matter with the OOV OOV and that Parliament OOV to OOV OOV to one OOV when OOV with OOV as important as the OOV system in OOV .
In the OOV of all of which , OOV OOV , how OOV that the OOV of the European Parliament has OOV , in this case at least , to be OOV to the OOV than the OOV and political OOV of the OOV authorities .
<P> As you know , a few OOV OOV , on OOV OOV , OOV and OOV OOV OOV on the OOV in order , OOV , to OOV the OOV ' OOV , as the OOV OOV OOV us in another OOV .
OOV OOV were OOV and OOV were OOV during this OOV .
OOV , of course , three OOV OOV also OOV .
OOV what is the OOV of all this OOV ?
The OOV OOV in the OOV OOV is OOV on a OOV OOV , making it OOV to OOV the OOV of more OOV , more OOV and more OOV .
<P> OOV OOV OOV for a resolution quite OOV OOV the need to OOV further OOV and therefore OOV on the OOV government to take OOV OOV measures to OOV any such OOV .
That is our main OOV .
OOV course , what we also need is an OOV OOV with international OOV and for responsibility to be OOV for what OOV on OOV OOV .
I think we also need the situation to be OOV with the OOV and under the OOV of the European Union .
I OOV of OOV because OOV is , of course , a OOV country and its OOV must OOV the OOV OOV , which are OOV by such OOV , OOV which , of course , are OOV by us and , I OOV , by the Commission , which is OOV on in our resolution to OOV OOV the situation in OOV OOV in its OOV report .
<P> These are , I am OOV to say , the OOV OOV and they are not OOV by the OOV , not to say OOV OOV of the OOV OOV out by OOV 's OOV to the European Parliament .
<SPEAKER OOV LANGUAGE="SV" NAME=" OOV , OOV " > Mr President , it really is OOV OOV to OOV how OOV OOV should be OOV .
OOV OOV , I OOV a great deal of OOV from the OOV OOV of the Parliament OOV OOV with the OOV conditions in these OOV .
I do not think , however , that the problems we are OOV OOV are about the good or OOV OOV of OOV .
A great many of the OOV in OOV OOV are , after all , OOV for political OOV .
It OOV to reason that they will continue their political OOV as political OOV .
In this way , the efforts of the OOV Government OOV military OOV and OOV measures also OOV part of a political OOV OOV against the OOV and other OOV that OOV the OOV OOV .
<P> The situation is OOV OOV for OOV society and the OOV Government .
A OOV different approach must be taken .
The political parties and the OOV OOV in OOV must be OOV to OOV as OOV as parties and OOV in the OOV of Europe .
The OOV between different OOV must be OOV by OOV means .
As long as that is not OOV , I cannot see how there would be any OOV of OOV ' s OOV a Member of the European Union .
<P> The OOV Government must OOV the way .
It must be OOV that OOV OOV of different national and cultural OOV which must all have the same rights .
OOV and OOV must be OOV in the OOV , especially in the OOV areas .
I believe that the only OOV that can be done is to OOV OOV to these political OOV and to OOV them from OOV .
OOV this OOV , there will be no more problems in OOV OOV than in OOV , OOV or OOV OOV .
<SPEAKER OOV OOV NAME=" OOV " > Mr President , when a debate on the OOV situation in OOV OOV was OOV during the last OOV OOV of the European Parliament in OOV 2000 , and the OOV OOV for OOV were OOV OOV to a OOV of OOV between the political OOV involved , the OOV in the OOV OOV was still in its OOV and the OOV of the OOV authorities had not yet OOV itself in all its OOV .
<P> OOV course , for a less OOV country than OOV , the very fact that the European Parliament OOV to take an interest in the matter would be OOV enough to put a OOV to any OOV of OOV its legal and OOV OOV .
OOV , however , did OOV the OOV , OOV yet again that it is indeed a OOV country .
It OOV and OOV OOV the Parliament of the European Union , which it OOV OOV to OOV and , OOV its OOV OOV OOV , OOV just a few OOV OOV in the OOV OOV of OOV of OOV , OOV an international OOV .
<P> OOV 's OOV - and in my view OOV OOV - resolution is , OOV , the OOV and a positive OOV , OOV , OOV OOV in the case of OOV , which has OOV OOV that it is OOV to such OOV .
So what we need , at long last , is for the European Union and the OOV international OOV to deal with OOV - in OOV not just OOV - OOV the same OOV and measures and the same rules as those used in OOV OOV OOV in order to OOV respect for OOV OOV , human rights and the OOV of law , OOV OOV . without OOV OOV political and other action and interests and without OOV OOV OOV of OOV OOV OOV .
OOV as OOV the European Union in particular , to make it OOV clear at long last to OOV and to its OOV OOV , not just in words but - I OOV - with OOV , that the OOV by which OOV is to OOV the European OOV , even OOV there is some OOV as to whether it OOV there , will OOV very OOV OOV OOV it OOV and OOV OOV its OOV and international OOV into OOV with the OOV rules of law and OOV which OOV the OOV of a OOV OOV society .
<SPEAKER OOV LANGUAGE="DE " NAME=" OOV " > Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , it really is OOV OOV that we find OOV OOV to OOV the situation in OOV - or rather the situation in that country 's OOV - again and so OOV .
I would be OOV if we were able to give OOV OOV today for having OOV a difficult situation in a OOV way .
But OOV we cannot .
We in the European Parliament must therefore OOV that OOV itself should OOV - and where necessary that the Commission should also do its OOV in OOV - how this OOV situation has OOV in OOV at all .
I have in OOV not only its OOV and the OOV OOV there , but also how the need OOV for military and OOV OOV at the OOV of so many OOV .
<P> OOV , we must OOV in no OOV terms that there should be OOV in the OOV of OOV , and that OOV should have the right to see OOV , and not just under the OOV of OOV and OOV OOV , but also in OOV such that the OOV can OOV OOV out serious OOV with OOV results .
<P> OOV , we must OOV that OOV should OOV to OOV a OOV within its OOV , in particular with human rights organisations and in OOV to the human rights situation in OOV , and that it should consider how the situation can be OOV and a OOV OOV can be OOV in this respect .
<P> OOV , those OOV who are OOV being OOV as political OOV under OOV and OOV OOV - and it is often OOV in OOV that there are such OOV - should be OOV .
This would certainly OOV the situation in OOV OOV .
<P> OOV , we must OOV a change in OOV 's OOV .
OOV all , it is not just a question of OOV that once they are OOV , OOV should be OOV OOV and that when there is a OOV OOV an OOV should be made to OOV the situation OOV .
The real question is why there are so many people in OOV .
The reason that there are so many people in OOV is that there are OOV which provide for people to be OOV because of their OOV , which may also find OOV through OOV OOV or OOV , rather than OOV them for OOV OOV which they have OOV .
This is OOV OOV in a OOV democracy .
OOV that in OOV , Mr President , I wish to OOV once more to OOV to OOV OOV these OOV from its OOV OOV and to OOV OOV political OOV .
<P> <SPEAKER OOV OOV NAME=" OOV " > Mr President , I should like to start , on behalf of the OOV OOV of OOV and the OOV people in general , by OOV our OOV both with the political OOV in OOV and with all the OOV people who OOV under the OOV OOV .
I should then like to point out that every OOV has its OOV and its OOV .
There are those who OOV the OOV and there are those who aid and OOV .
The OOV here is , of course , the OOV OOV which , a OOV , OOV every OOV , every OOV and every OOV as a OOV , OOV it then OOV to OOV .
The OOV , however , are more serious ; they are the international OOV system , the United States , OOV and the European Union , all of which have OOV economic , OOV and political interests in OOV and are OOV all possible means to support the OOV OOV in OOV , the OOV which has no OOV about OOV OOV , because what we had here was not in fact a case of political OOV OOV themselves on OOV ; it was a case of their being OOV with OOV .
<P> So these OOV need to be OOV , the OOV who OOV OOV OOV OOV , the OOV who do OOV to help the political OOV .
We OOV the problem back in OOV , we OOV on more than two OOV for the OOV of the European Parliament to OOV - and OOV was done - and the last time we OOV for OOV was when the OOV had already been OOV out - and again OOV was done .
I am OOV that the resolution before us is very OOV , it OOV even OOV the action by the OOV OOV ; more OOV , it does not OOV those who are OOV the OOV OOV .
<P> It would , of course , be OOV if those who OOV OOV the OOV OOV OOV OOV were to take a different OOV towards OOV .
<SPEAKER OOV OOV NAME=" OOV " > Mr President , the OOV of three political OOV were OOV during the last OOV under OOV OOV and today we are OOV a OOV OOV for a resolution by OOV OOV on the same subject .
This is not the time to OOV what has OOV and what has OOV and what we OOV OOV with our OOV .
OOV is a OOV country for OOV of the European Union .
However , there is OOV of OOV on OOV OOV and the matter is very serious .
I OOV am in favour of OOV 's European OOV .
However , we have OOV - even OOV - that people who have OOV and who still OOV an important role in European OOV , such as OOV OOV OOV and OOV , OOV to be in favour of OOV 's European OOV when they are OOV as OOV but , when OOV at OOV OOV and OOV , OOV that OOV has no place in the European Union .
<P> This conflict of words OOV us into a political OOV .
OOV , OOV , it OOV those who we say want an economic Europe ; however , it does not help the political Europe which interests the European Parliament .
So as long as certain parties OOV in a way which OOV the OOV that the system which OOV has the OOV hand in OOV could take OOV in Europe , then we are again OOV into a OOV .
OOV ?
OOV every time we look for OOV against OOV 's European OOV , we find them in OOV 's OOV to OOV to European OOV .
OOV the OOV of OOV must be an OOV OOV as far as we are concerned .
<P> OOV and gentlemen , we must be OOV and we must be OOV : OOV as OOV OOV with European OOV by OOV , as OOV its OOV , and OOV as OOV the way in which we OOV them .
This policy OOV us , it OOV OOV and it OOV its people .
If , for any reason , we are not OOV on OOV of respect for human rights , democracy , OOV and , at the same time , OOV with international law , then we shall not be OOV OOV OOV or OOV any OOV .
<P> OOV in OOV <SPEAKER OOV LANGUAGE="FR" NAME=" OOV " > Mr President , at the start of this OOV , the OOV from our group , the Union for a Europe of OOV Group , for a debate on the situation in OOV was OOV .
The OOV OOV this OOV was just what one might OOV , OOV a OOV of OOV OOV , OOV but OOV OOV , on the part of the OOV OOV of those for OOV the OOV OOV of human rights has become a OOV of OOV OOV in the place of any real political OOV , OOV , as is the case for at least a few , with no result other than to OOV more OOV OOV .
<P> So our own OOV is not OOV but political .
We , of course , wish to OOV our OOV at the OOV OOV which OOV the OOV OOV a OOV more each OOV , but we are also aware that the OOV have had more than enough OOV .
OOV , OOV to the OOV policy of their OOV , President OOV , it has been OOV - and that at least is an OOV - that no OOV of reason , no OOV of OOV , no OOV at OOV , in a OOV , no political OOV will be OOV by the OOV .
We must take action , and we must OOV that those Member States that OOV their OOV OOV , and OOV more than that , are well and OOV OOV of OOV in the OOV we are OOV here , with each OOV OOV the last in a OOV of OOV .
<P> That , ladies and gentlemen , is the OOV of the matter .
OOV Member States are actually OOV of OOV with the OOV of OOV .
They OOV OOV OOV , OOV , OOV the OOV , OOV , OOV and OOV .
OOV they even welcome in OOV , in full OOV , the OOV of OOV OOV OOV in my own country .
We believe that any OOV OOV of human rights must OOV with the OOV of the OOV of law in OOV and must OOV towards OOV the OOV of a government and a OOV OOV in what we OOV in OOV OOV OOV .
<P> OOV human rights OOV should not OOV OOV to the OOV OOV .
I am OOV in particular of the other countries of OOV OOV , OOV , OOV and OOV .
It must also help support them , in particular , OOV from all the OOV which have been OOV up out of all OOV , when they come up against such an OOV OOV OOV , which is all the more OOV because it is OOV OOV by OOV OOV , OOV which are not even European , if you get my OOV , and which are taking OOV of an OOV situation to OOV OOV OOV the OOV , working through these OOV .
The OOV OOV between OOV are at work , and the OOV is not just the OOV people , but OOV itself , and its OOV and OOV most OOV OOV .
<P> So , Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , OOV us OOV once and for all to get a clear OOV of the state of OOV in OOV .
OOV , there are OOV OOV at work in OOV .
OOV , once again OOV , although , OOV OOV itself open to this with its OOV OOV OOV , has been given over to OOV OOV and my own country , OOV , which OOV OOV some responsibility towards this country , will continue to OOV them in the OOV of OOV OOV and to ensure that the government and the OOV which the country has OOV OOV in OOV as best they can in the OOV of OOV and certain OOV OOV - including , I OOV , by some of our OOV - peace and the OOV of a state which is , even today , a OOV state .
<SPEAKER OOV LANGUAGE="FR" NAME=" OOV " > Mr President , Commissioner , we must not OOV hope .
The OOV OOV in OOV and OOV the world by President OOV ' s civil OOV initiative must not give way to the OOV view that there is really OOV that can be done in this country to OOV OOV and OOV the OOV of law .
In the same way that we have made a OOV to OOV those who , in the OOV country , have OOV against OOV OOV , it is our OOV to do all we can to support those in favour of OOV and OOV in OOV .
It is Europe ' s OOV , and it is also in its interest .
It is in Europe ' s interest to OOV the area of peace and OOV which it has OOV in OOV within Europe to the OOV Mediterranean , by OOV the OOV OOV .
It is in Europe ' s interest to OOV to the OOV it OOV from the whole of the OOV of OOV to OOV OOV of cooperation which will OOV OOV a OOV on the OOV OOV of OOV .
<P> We OOV must become aware that we have as much to OOV as to OOV in OOV this OOV the OOV .
OOV own future will OOV on the way we OOV in OOV the OOV of OOV to OOV from OOV and OOV .
I am OOV OOV to the OOV to OOV OOV OOV in a OOV Europe which would be OOV , one OOV , by its very OOV , to find itself under OOV .
That is why I shall support the OOV OOV for a resolution which will be put to the vote in this House OOV .
On this OOV , I would ask our OOV OOV to OOV that we certainly do not want to look like we are OOV out of some OOV of OOV of OOV , but as people of OOV , OOV to OOV them , if they so wish , in OOV an end to their current OOV OOV and to OOV with them , in future , the OOV of OOV which have OOV us OOV OOV .
<SPEAKER OOV LANGUAGE="FR" NAME=" OOV " > Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , in OOV , the OOV of OOV has been OOV by a new OOV in the OOV : after all the OOV OOV which have taken place since OOV , at the start of the civil OOV , not to OOV the OOV of people OOV or OOV , and the OOV and OOV of their OOV .
OOV the civil OOV law OOV by OOV OOV , there has been no OOV to the OOV .
The OOV people still OOV to peace and OOV , yet these OOV to be OOV with OOV of OOV .
As the international human rights organisations have OOV , the OOV against OOV OOV is being OOV OOV .
It is OOV for the OOV authorities to agree to OOV all those responsible for all these OOV before the OOV .
<P> In this OOV , one question OOV .
What is the OOV of the OOV OOV and OOV of the OOV OOV ?
In OOV , no one can OOV the OOV of the OOV military OOV which has been in OOV for OOV years , OOV the political system and OOV a OOV of OOV .
For too long Europe has OOV not to OOV in OOV in OOV , OOV with the OOV OOV .
We need OOV to OOV our OOV OOV view which OOV OOV as OOV responsible for the current OOV .
OOV society is OOV OOV by OOV OOV and social and economic OOV .
<P> Europe ' s OOV to OOV a OOV position OOV the OOV that the social OOV for change , which OOV hope for the future and which are OOV to OOV themselves of the OOV OOV to OOV , will be OOV and OOV .
OOV OOV OOV to the OOV OOV the people , and by making it possible to OOV a right of OOV , OOV OOV may be OOV between the two OOV of the Mediterranean .
In order to help OOV to OOV OOV OOV , relations should OOV to be OOV a matter of state , but should be in the interests of the OOV .
OOV us OOV OOV that any OOV of rights OOV OOV the working OOV and provide an OOV OOV OOV for all OOV of OOV .
<SPEAKER OOV LANGUAGE="FR" NAME=" OOV " > Mr President , last OOV OOV , OOV people were OOV at a OOV OOV in the OOV OOV OOV ; on OOV , OOV OOV , a young OOV OOV was OOV in a OOV in the OOV of OOV ; a OOV before that , OOV high OOV OOV were OOV OOV OOV their own OOV OOV .
OOV has just OOV its OOV OOV for two years .
OOV two OOV people - OOV , women , OOV , the OOV - have been OOV ; OOV have been OOV and OOV .
The OOV , OOV and OOV OOV OOV by the OOV OOV OOV OOV to be on the increase , if indeed it OOV actually OOV .
<P> This information is OOV OOV from the OOV .
OOV the OOV OOV OOV , OOV OOV in the case of OOV , can only be OOV .
So I should like to OOV OOV to the OOV OOV , one of the most OOV in the OOV world , which has OOV such a high OOV at the OOV of those who are OOV OOV to any form of OOV of OOV and who OOV of an OOV people subject to their OOV .
OOV , in the last year , and more , OOV of OOV are OOV to have OOV their OOV in OOV for a OOV OOV .
<P> The OOV of President OOV had given the people hope , but we are OOV to OOV that the OOV taken by the OOV OOV law ' is a very long way from OOV to peace .
OOV OOV the OOV people OOV OOV OOV in order to OOV OOV , the OOV for such OOV - OOV by some as OOV against OOV - and the OOV of OOV OOV upon the OOV of these OOV OOV to have OOV them to the point that they are OOV their OOV work .
<P> OOV attention should be OOV OOV to the OOV of the OOV of the OOV of the OOV of OOV , which are OOV that they have OOV no form of OOV OOV OOV ' OOV OOV are given financial support in order to be OOV into society ?
<P> OOV the OOV OOV OOV of OOV women should be OOV , since they are the main OOV of OOV yet , at the same time , still OOV to a OOV OOV which OOV their most OOV rights ?
<P> Finally , the economic and social situation is also OOV , when it already OOV a OOV OOV OOV for the OOV of OOV in the OOV .
OOV to OOV OOV OOV - I am OOV of OOV - OOV OOV itself in a OOV which has already OOV to an OOV OOV in OOV .
OOV than OOV , OOV with the OOV and with an OOV which is OOV against OOV and OOV and for a OOV future is OOV OOV .
<SPEAKER OOV OOV " NAME=" OOV > Mr President , much has already been said by other Members .
This new OOV OOV where even OOV OOV are OOV without OOV OOV us back to a situation we OOV was OOV us .
OOV we all OOV that , OOV , OOV will have to OOV with OOV for some time to come , this OOV during OOV is OOV the OOV back .
<P> We did hope President OOV ' s initiative would have a positive OOV , but the OOV of the last few OOV give us OOV for concern .
That is why , like other Members , I believe we must not OOV to OOV OOV and OOV full cooperation to the OOV government to OOV it .
<P> OOV said that , we must not OOV the OOV OOV the OOV progress being made towards democracy and the OOV of law , and the OOV against OOV cannot OOV the OOV OOV of OOV by the OOV , OOV OOV of the OOV .
So , on his OOV , President OOV was right to OOV an agreement and to give EUR OOV million to OOV the OOV OOV and OOV a OOV for OOV .
I think that is OOV what OOV to be done , OOV with OOV OOV of OOV OOV in our countries .
OOV , that is not possible in some of them , OOV it has been possible , on the other hand , to provide OOV for many OOV who have OOV very OOV OOV from there .
<P> Finally , I think we should consider OOV a OOV to OOV .
It is a long time since Parliament OOV that country and the first OOV we need to do is find out OOV what is going on .
<SPEAKER OOV OOV " OOV OOV OOV " > Mr President , why is there a OOV OOV when it OOV to Europe ' s OOV to the OOV OOV in OOV ?
This OOV is in OOV OOV with our OOV of what OOV OOV OOV in the world .
The OOV in OOV have not OOV .
OOV continue to OOV OOV .
OOV is still the order of the OOV .
<P> In the OOV year OOV , two to three OOV people were OOV each OOV in the most OOV way .
If we take OOV of OOV years of OOV OOV , the OOV are OOV .
OOV OOV and OOV people OOV and another OOV OOV people OOV .
That is OOV as many as under the OOV OOV .
<P> President OOV made OOV OOV to OOV OOV , OOV into OOV and look into OOV .
But OOV of these OOV has been OOV into action .
OOV still go OOV .
OOV who in the OOV of OOV OOV out OOV OOV , continue to get OOV OOV .
OOV , security OOV who are OOV of OOV are not being OOV to OOV .
<P> OOV of reason , therefore , to take the OOV authorities to OOV about this .
But why , in fact , is this not being done ?
OOV it because of the OOV OOV interests in the OOV OOV ?
OOV the Member States OOV OOV because they are OOV to OOV some OOV OOV OOV themselves ?
OOV we OOV about OOV OOV in our own countries ?
OOV is it OOV the OOV of further OOV the OOV of OOV OOV ?
The most OOV OOV of the state is to OOV its people .
It is OOV how the OOV authorities do not come up to the OOV in this respect .
<P> It is high time that the European Union OOV a OOV for the OOV of the OOV OOV and put its own interests second .
The OOV has OOV to OOV .
OOV OOV agreement must be OOV at the OOV opportunity , OOV OOV us to OOV the political OOV .
OOV question to the Commissioner is the following : what is the OOV ?
For we cannot OOV OOV any OOV .
<SPEAKER OOV NAME=" OOV " > The Commission OOV Parliament 's concern about the situation of the OOV OOV who are still on OOV OOV .
The health of certain of these OOV is a matter of serious concern .
It OOV upon the OOV authorities to OOV a OOV OOV .
In any OOV , the OOV security OOV should OOV OOV .
<P> OOV the OOV OOV by OOV and OOV in OOV OOV in OOV last year , the Commission OOV that OOV will be OOV out into the OOV of the OOV and the OOV which OOV during these OOV and that those responsible will be OOV .
OOV of OOV and OOV OOV of OOV during their OOV after the OOV should also be OOV .
<P> The Commission OOV that the OOV of OOV conditions in OOV OOV is OOV in the OOV OOV for OOV which OOV political OOV by the Council on OOV OOV 2000 .
In the OOV OOV , the OOV of the OOV conditions to OOV them into OOV with the OOV OOV OOV rules for the OOV of OOV and other international OOV is OOV as a priority .
<P> OOV now to OOV , I can say the following : The Commission OOV the OOV authorities ' efforts to OOV about national OOV and end the OOV .
OOV , the OOV of law , human rights and OOV OOV are OOV OOV that the European Union OOV OOV to all its OOV .
We OOV OOV 's OOV of the OOV OOV in the negotiations for an OOV agreement .
The OOV , however , OOV new OOV every OOV .
We are particularly concerned by the OOV of OOV during OOV which OOV many OOV OOV the country .
OOV must also find a way of OOV the OOV OOV of OOV who have OOV OOV .
<P> OOV OOV the OOV of OOV OOV in OOV , the Commission OOV OOV concerned at the human rights OOV and , in particular , the OOV .
It is OOV that OOV action be taken against OOV OOV and OOV in the matter of human rights .
<P> We continue to OOV these issues at every level of the political OOV with the OOV authorities .
Mr OOV , for example , OOV the need to OOV peace OOV the country during his OOV to OOV on OOV and OOV OOV .
<P> As part of this approach and in order to provide OOV support for OOV 's efforts , the Commission , OOV by Mr OOV , has OOV OOV OOV OOV EUR OOV million for two human rights OOV .
OOV OOV of support for the country 's OOV and OOV and the other one OOV to OOV and OOV the OOV OOV , making it able to work as a OOV OOV should in a democracy .
<SPEAKER OOV NAME=" President " > OOV you , Commissioner .
<P> The debate is OOV .
<P> OOV on when the debate OOV , the vote will take place at OOV OOV OOV
As you know , after the OOV and OOV debate , we will have a OOV OOV OOV OOV OOV and then the decision will be taken as to whether or not to OOV the debate on the OOV report .
The vote will then take place after the OOV on the OOV report at OOV OOV OOV of at OOV OOV OOV OOV OOV OOV Court <SPEAKER OOV NAME=" President " > The next OOV is the OOV debate on the following OOV for OOV : <P> OOV by Mrs OOV , on behalf of the OOV Group , on the OOV of the Treaty of OOV to OOV the OOV OOV Court ; <P> OOV by Mrs OOV and OOV , on behalf of the OOV Group on the OOV OOV of a OOV OOV OOV OOV Court ; <P> OOV by Mrs OOV and OOV , on behalf of the OOV on the OOV OOV into OOV of the Treaty of OOV on the OOV OOV Court ; <P> OOV by Mr OOV OOV and Mr OOV , on behalf of the OOV Group , on the OOV of the Treaty of OOV to OOV the OOV OOV Court .
<P> OOV by Mr OOV and OOV , on behalf of the OOV Group , on the OOV of the Treaty of OOV to OOV the OOV OOV Court .
<P> OOV by Mr OOV OOV OOV and OOV , on behalf of the OOV Group , on the OOV OOV Court .
<SPEAKER OOV OOV " NAME=" OOV " > Mr President , I welcome the fact that this matter OOV on the OOV here today , for the OOV OOV Court is OOV well .
The OOV for the OOV to OOV this Treaty of OOV was OOV OOV .
We all know how difficult is was to OOV it about .
OOV this , we OOV how in the very last OOV of 2000 , all of a OOV a OOV number of countries OOV the Treaty .
At the time , OOV countries OOV in favour and OOV against .
At present , more than OOV countries have OOV it , including the United States which OOV OOV against it , but also OOV , OOV and OOV OOV it at the last OOV .
<P> At any OOV , this OOV support for the Treaty OOV that the Treaty cannot be OOV a OOV OOV or one of OOV countries .
The support for it is far too OOV for that .
<P> We now need to OOV the Treaty , and that is what the resolution is about .
It is a OOV to see that OOV countries have already OOV it , OOV of which are in the European Union , but OOV , the United OOV , OOV , the OOV , OOV , OOV and OOV have not yet OOV it .
They are OOV about it , but it has not yet OOV .
OOV all the OOV countries , not one OOV country has OOV it , and OOV did not even OOV it .
We therefore need to OOV up our OOV , and we call on the Council to OOV this matter to the OOV .
It is important for Europe to take the OOV .
That is something we can do OOV , and we should not just OOV the OOV on OOV in the process .
We can take action , and it is important that we do so without further OOV .
<SPEAKER OOV LANGUAGE="DE " NAME=" OOV " > Mr President , I will be OOV .
The next OOV but one on the OOV is down as Mr OOV OOV OOV .
But it is Mr OOV OOV who will be OOV for our group .
OOV is a OOV OOV on agricultural OOV ; the other is a OOV OOV .
I OOV OOV to OOV that for you to OOV there being any OOV about who will OOV .
<SPEAKER OOV NAME=" President " > OOV you , Mr OOV .
You are as it were our OOV OOV .
OOV OOV you OOV
OOV you for OOV that out .
I am OOV that I would have OOV OOV on , because the right Mr OOV is also in the OOV .
<SPEAKER OOV OOV " NAME=" OOV > ( OOV .
( OOV ) Mr President , I must say I do OOV Mr OOV his OOV as a OOV , which not all of us in this House OOV .
However , the OOV countries which have OOV the Treaty of OOV OOV OOV Member States of the European Union , OOV the other OOV have OOV to OOV to the call .
That is one of the OOV of the European Union and it is also a OOV of the OOV of a OOV common OOV policy .
OOV , what other OOV can there be for the Member States of the Union which have not yet OOV the OOV OOV , OOV from OOV about a real , OOV further OOV of OOV and a certain OOV of OOV in themselves , OOV still OOV that one OOV they may OOV find themselves in the OOV position of the OOV ?
<P> That OOV OOV even more to the other major OOV on the international OOV .
It was right to OOV , as we did in our resolution , that President OOV OOV the Treaty of OOV at the end of last year , but it is OOV to OOV if he would have done so had the OOV vote OOV to give the OOV to OOV OOV .
<P> There is still a long road , OOV with OOV , to be OOV before the OOV can actually start work .
As the resolution OOV , it is OOV to OOV OOV to the OOV and there needs to be action to OOV the OOV OOV OOV into OOV or , at least , OOV it .
We hope the European Union will make this one of its OOV policy OOV since we are all in agreement , in OOV , and we also hope Parliament can continue to OOV an OOV role to make the OOV a OOV , OOV the issue of the OOV OOV on the OOV for every meeting of the OOV OOV , and OOV and OOV OOV like the one we will be OOV on OOV .
<P> I therefore OOV the fact that the OOV OOV for a resolution does not OOV up the issue of the OOV OOV , but I fully OOV the proposal and hope we will be able to OOV it .
<SPEAKER OOV OOV " NAME=" OOV > Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , in a few OOV Parliament will be OOV a resolution on the OOV OOV Court for the OOV time in OOV years .
This is OOV of Parliament ' s OOV and OOV in following , OOV by OOV , the OOV development of an OOV necessary international OOV - as OOV by the OOV of OOV , OOV , OOV and so many OOV .
They are now OOV to OOV the OOV which has so far OOV that so many OOV and OOV have been able to OOV on in their OOV OOV , and even take OOV with full OOV .
It also OOV how OOV Parliament is to that development , OOV the way for the European Union in many OOV .
<P> I OOV the OOV OOV , when we OOV OOV for a European Union with OOV Member States OOV and OOV in this OOV , OOV the OOV OOV of the OOV : the OOV of the OOV , the OOV ' s OOV in OOV OOV , the OOV of the OOV of the OOV ' s OOV and so on .
<P> OOV OOV have been OOV .
Mrs OOV has OOV OOV the importance of OOV those OOV and OOV the OOV of the OOV from those who OOV up to it - such as OOV , for OOV , or OOV - to continue to OOV to the Court OOV of Member OOV , but actually in order to OOV the negotiations OOV , even OOV OOV for OOV OOV .
<P> OOV is not what is OOV ; what is OOV is to achieve the OOV OOV as OOV as possible .
That is the real OOV for the OOV .
I hope the issue will be on the OOV in our relations with third countries , and I hope the OOV countries of the Union which have not yet OOV the OOV will do so this year .
<SPEAKER OOV LANGUAGE="DE " NAME=" OOV , OOV " > Mr President , it does indeed OOV some OOV when two people have the same OOV and not even the OOV OOV are able to OOV between them .
OOV OOV also OOV OOV up OOV for the same reason .
<P> OOV the OOV OOV of the OOV OOV OOV , the United OOV OOV the OOV of OOV up an international OOV OOV .
OOV OOV was given to this initiative by the OOV of international law in OOV and the OOV in OOV .
OOV people are OOV where the OOV OOV Court will have OOV OOV with the OOV which already OOV .
The OOV in OOV rules on the OOV and OOV of the OOV of the European Union .
The OOV Court of OOV in The OOV rules on international OOV .
The OOV Court of OOV Rights in OOV OOV OOV on OOV by States of rights OOV from the OOV Rights OOV .
<P> The OOV OOV Court is being set up for the OOV particularly serious OOV of OOV , OOV against OOV , OOV OOV and OOV of OOV .
OOV now the United OOV has OOV OOV OOV , for example the OOV OOV OOV OOV for the OOV OOV in OOV and OOV .
In the future , the OOV OOV Court will OOV out a clear OOV that OOV of any of these OOV will be OOV and OOV .
OOV OOV will no OOV be able to OOV OOV the OOV of OOV .
<P> The new Court is an important OOV for the international OOV which will OOV it to OOV OOV in OOV OOV .
I should therefore like to call on all of the Member States to OOV the OOV OOV , and I would OOV OOV of the resolution .
<SPEAKER OOV NAME=" OOV " > Mr President , this OOV OOV for a resolution on the OOV of the OOV Treaty to OOV the OOV OOV OOV Court OOV at an OOV OOV .
OOV OOV in this House we OOV our OOV for the United OOV OOV Rights Commission in OOV .
The Swedish OOV OOV once again OOV the importance of human rights during the Swedish Presidency .
The OOV this OOV is yet another OOV OOV of OOV OOV the world .
OOV it must OOV , and I hope the House will agree , that if we are serious about the human rights of OOV , women and OOV , then we must have a OOV OOV OOV Court to OOV those who OOV out or OOV OOV against OOV .
We need a OOV OOV with international OOV , which can OOV OOV those OOV of such OOV .
OOV with OOV OOV to OOV the OOV Treaty will we be able to end the OOV of the OOV of these OOV and OOV to the OOV and OOV of such OOV in the future .
<P> As we have OOV , OOV OOV have OOV the OOV Treaty yet OOV only OOV have OOV it .
OOV such OOV are OOV for the Treaty to OOV into OOV and for the Court to be set up .
OOV I believe it is OOV that the Member States set an example .
OOV OOV , OOV , OOV , OOV , OOV , OOV , OOV and OOV have OOV and OOV OOV the Treaty .
It is now time for the OOV Member States of the Union to OOV OOV .
<P> OOV is an OOV OOV and I will not OOV in it .
I believe we should welcome the OOV of the Treaty on OOV OOV by the United States of OOV and we should also welcome the OOV OOV OOV the Treaty on OOV OOV 2000 .
We must now call upon those OOV to OOV the Treaty .
<P> OOV , at the same time we must OOV all OOV to continue to support the work of the OOV OOV OOV for OOV and OOV OOV .
<P> OOV OOV us that we must OOV OOV .
OOV , look back OOV the last OOV .
OOV now OOV the world as it is and OOV that the OOV of OOV is OOV OOV .
<P> OOV OOV will OOV OOV us if we OOV our OOV OOV from those who have OOV such OOV OOV and who continue to OOV as I OOV .
OOV are not enough .
The time for action is now .
OOV the OOV Treaty on the OOV and OOV OOV our OOV and our OOV to the OOV of the world .
As OOV I OOV the House and the Council to support this OOV .
<SPEAKER OOV LANGUAGE="DE " NAME=" OOV " > Mr President , if we look at the OOV of EU Member States which have already OOV the Treaty , we see that OOV of the OOV OOV Members have already OOV OOV .
OOV the OOV has not , although it OOV OOV OOV for this Court and also for its OOV .
We therefore OOV what OOV OOV this .
OOV the OOV OOV Member States of the European Union , there are only three which have already OOV it , including much OOV OOV .
I should also like to call on the other States of the European Union to OOV the OOV process as OOV as possible .
We need this OOV Court so that international OOV against OOV - which , as you know , have OOV not OOV but OOV to increase in number - can OOV be OOV to a OOV , OOV and OOV OOV .
<P> OOV we OOV about OOV .
We are OOV the OOV OOV .
The OOV OOV which are set up there are certainly OOV .
But we must be aware that they are being OOV by some OOV OOV in these countries who say that they are OOV ' OOV .
OOV OOV this from OOV to OOV , it is OOV important for there OOV to be one OOV OOV OOV OOV the world so that we no OOV need to OOV through OOV OOV .
The OOV OOV for the OOV OOV in The OOV is very OOV .
It needs our support .
But you will have OOV that two OOV OOV President OOV , who only OOV was making OOV OOV in Parliament , OOV to OOV OOV OOV OOV because OOV was OOV not of OOV OOV in OOV with the rules of OOV .
This is OOV .
It OOV how important it is not only to OOV legal OOV in international law OOV the world , OOV against OOV , OOV OOV and OOV , but also to provide the OOV OOV with which to OOV them .
This is first and OOV this OOV Court .
We have OOV OOV for it and it is high time that it be able to take up its OOV .
<SPEAKER OOV NAME=" OOV " > OOV OOV the OOV of the OOV OOV Court does not come within its OOV , the Commission OOV that the OOV number of OOV OOV will OOV be OOV so that the Court can become OOV .
<P> As of OOV OOV , the OOV was OOV by OOV countries and OOV by OOV .
The Commission OOV , with OOV , that the United States OOV the OOV OOV on OOV OOV and the OOV OOV OOV on OOV OOV .
<P> In its relations with third countries the Commission will make every OOV to OOV the OOV to OOV and OOV the OOV as OOV as possible .
In the OOV , the Commission will continue to provide OOV to OOV in support of the OOV OOV Court .
<P> So far , OOV EUR OOV million of OOV have been OOV to support the OOV of OOV or OOV working on information OOV OOV the OOV OOV Court .
The Commission will provide further support for these OOV this year .
We want to OOV this and use our cooperation with OOV to OOV up the OOV to make this Court a OOV .
<SPEAKER OOV NAME=" President " > OOV you , Commissioner .
<P> The debate is OOV .
<P> The vote will take place at OOV OOV OOV OOV OOV OOV in OOV OOV <SPEAKER OOV NAME=" President " > The next OOV is the OOV debate on the following OOV for OOV : <P> OOV by Mr OOV OOV and OOV , on behalf of the OOV Group , on the OOV in OOV OOV ; <P> OOV by Mr OOV OOV and OOV , on behalf of the OOV Group , on OOV OOV ; <P> OOV by Mr OOV and OOV , on behalf of the OOV Group , on the OOV in OOV OOV ; <P> OOV by Mr OOV , on behalf of the OOV Group , on the OOV in OOV OOV .
<SPEAKER OOV OOV " NAME=" OOV " > Mr President , OOV has OOV once again in OOV OOV , two years after OOV , the OOV OOV OOV OOV are still being OOV to this OOV and for which , I might OOV , it would OOV the European Union still has not come up with the OOV it had OOV .
<P> I welcome the resolution which we were able to OOV together , but I do consider it to be the OOV OOV after all the OOV which OOV OOV has OOV , and now after this last OOV OOV .
If OOV be OOV , I find it a OOV of a OOV resolution , for although the OOV of OOV which we all OOV and which OOV OOV to this resolution may be OOV well , we need to OOV our OOV into action , and that is why , on behalf of our group , we have OOV a few more amendments in order to OOV this OOV more into OOV and to OOV it .
OOV other things , this is to OOV the OOV OOV for OOV the situation to be put into OOV , especially the OOV programmes , but we should also OOV the OOV that Europe had set OOV for this .
OOV this , we believe that the OOV world , and we , OOV with the world , must OOV our OOV and OOV , now that OOV of people have OOV OOV to this OOV .
<P> OOV OOV in a OOV country is , of course , all the more serious the less OOV and less OOV the country has .
OOV OOV has OOV a OOV and OOV OOV , and now there is this on OOV of OOV OOV .
In order to work OOV in OOV responsible OOV , the government too should set its political OOV for certain OOV of OOV of aid to one OOV , and we , on the other hand , must OOV our OOV .
<SPEAKER OOV LANGUAGE="ES " NAME=" OOV OOV " > Mr President , with regard to this resolution , which has OOV the OOV of all the OOV , I would like to OOV the last OOV , which OOV to the need for OOV of the economic aid which , on this OOV , we are going to OOV to OOV OOV , that very OOV country .
<P> I have just OOV to the OOV responsible for OOV aid in OOV and I would like to OOV to this House , and to the Commissioner , the great concern of all those OOV people who , today , are working on OOV aid , and who , OOV , will be involved in cooperation work , and the concern of the OOV and international OOV about the fact that we have yet to OOV the OOV economic aid following OOV OOV , when we are now OOV the next OOV OOV .
<P> Members of the Commission , OOV us see if , this time , we can make it on time .
I am OOV this not only as a OOV of the OOV for OOV with the OOV of OOV OOV and OOV , but also as OOV OOV of the Group of the European OOV ' s OOV and European OOV in the Committee on OOV OOV .
OOV OOV so OOV is to OOV OOV OOV .
OOV must be OOV on time and the OOV - not only those in OOV OOV , but also those in OOV - will have to OOV their OOV .
Mr OOV ' s OOV must OOV some OOV .
OOV us see whether or not , this time , the aid to OOV the OOV of the OOV OOV before another OOV OOV OOV this OOV country .
<P> OOV be OOV , aid must OOV at the right time .
OOV , there will be so many people working with no OOV in those countries , so many people OOV , so many OOV costs , and for what ?
If we cannot do it any other way , OOV us OOV aid by means of the Member States .
We already give OOV to the OOV - to the OOV - we are the main OOV , and they only OOV the United OOV OOV .
So , although it does not look good , OOV us do it by means of OOV or OOV , or under two OOV , but the OOV aid , and especially the cooperation aid , must OOV .
OOV us not make OOV of OOV again .
<P> <SPEAKER OOV OOV " NAME=" OOV > Madam President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , the OOV and OOV OOV out of OOV OOV are OOV , with the OOV of OOV , the OOV of OOV , the OOV of people who have OOV and the OOV OOV who have OOV their OOV .
There are OOV OOV in OOV OOV and even in OOV .
This situation OOV in OOV OOV is OOV new .
As Mrs OOV and Mr OOV OOV OOV out , OOV OOV , in OOV OOV , also had OOV OOV in both human and OOV terms in that part of the world .
<P> OOV OOV is one of the world ' s OOV regions .
OOV OOV % of the OOV OOV OOV the OOV OOV and Europe therefore has a particular responsibility to the region not only because it is a region that has OOV much serious conflict and where there is still OOV , particularly over OOV , but also because we need to OOV their OOV for the OOV of democracy .
<P> I am OOV to say that all OOV there are OOV OOV , but very OOV OOV still OOV in these OOV OOV countries .
OOV from this , they have a very OOV OOV OOV and only two countries are involved in the initiative that has been OOV .
OOV , the OOV we OOV from the OOV authorities in OOV OOV countries - and on OOV we had the opportunity to OOV the President of OOV - is of a people that is OOV and that , just when it OOV a OOV OOV at the end of the OOV and OOV to OOV itself up in order to OOV its problems and its OOV , is OOV by OOV OOV OOV by these OOV OOV .
<P> Europe OOV OOV in OOV OOV aid , both in OOV OOV and this time .
OOV , the problem OOV - as my two OOV Members have already OOV more than OOV - more OOV aid .
It is OOV that the Commission OOV its OOV programme for OOV OOV .
What we are OOV , Commissioner OOV , is that there should be a OOV OOV of this programme , with greater resources , both human and financial , to achieve the OOV of OOV OOV OOV as well .
On OOV OOV of this year , another meeting will be OOV between the OOV OOV Group and the European Union in OOV .
A positive way to OOV this meeting with the OOV OOV Group would be to OOV to OOV the OOV programme for OOV OOV with the new OOV for OOV the OOV in OOV OOV .
<SPEAKER OOV LANGUAGE="ES " NAME=" OOV OOV " > Mr President , my group , the OOV Group of the European United OOV OOV OOV , would like to OOV its OOV to the OOV of OOV for the OOV of the OOV of the recent OOV , and for the people of OOV OOV , following this OOV OOV .
In fact , I had the OOV and OOV responsibility of OOV a report to this House , on behalf of the Committee on OOV OOV , on aid for the OOV of OOV OOV following OOV OOV , which was adopted OOV .
The OOV is that I feel OOV that our OOV and efforts have not been OOV by OOV on the part of the people responsible for the implementation of this programme .
<P> On that OOV , I OOV out that , when the OOV OOV , the Commission OOV OOV in terms of OOV aid .
This has been the case this time as well , but we must continue to provide this aid .
We must be more OOV .
<P> The OOV of the OOV was OOV .
This region was OOV to OOV and it is going to be OOV that we make an OOV OOV to achieve OOV of economic , social and OOV security .
The European Union has to do some very OOV work in this area and , OOV the problems to be OOV , there is one I would like to OOV : the OOV OOV of the aid OOV .
<P> The European Union - and the Commission in particular - must OOV this from OOV , by OOV that OOV , OOV and local authorities OOV OOV in the OOV of the aid , for the OOV of the OOV and OOV of the efforts made by the European Union .
<SPEAKER OOV LANGUAGE="DE " OOV " > Mr President , the OOV Group is OOV and OOV with OOV at the OOV of the OOV OOV in OOV OOV .
We OOV our OOV OOV and OOV with the many who OOV or were OOV and the many who have OOV their OOV and their OOV .
The OOV Group OOV the OOV for a resolution OOV by OOV OOV in the European Parliament .
It is good to know that the Community has OOV to this OOV OOV so OOV by OOV OOV and OOV .
This is a OOV example of OOV .
<P> This is a OOV OOV for me to OOV that , as a positive OOV of the OOV of OOV , when I was a OOV OOV in the OOV OOV in the OOV , I did not OOV OOV as other young OOV did , but OOV with my own OOV for the OOV and OOV in an area of OOV which had OOV an OOV .
On that OOV we were able to OOV very many people who had been OOV OOV .
This is a great OOV .
I can still see the OOV OOV from the OOV of the OOV in OOV , and I can OOV the OOV of OOV OOV in OOV OOV .
It is excellent that Europe has OOV help so OOV .
It is to be OOV that the aid will not come too OOV and that it will OOV OOV OOV through the OOV OOV .
<SPEAKER OOV LANGUAGE="DE " NAME=" OOV " > Mr President , I really must say that I am quite OOV at how one can OOV , in a debate about an OOV in OOV OOV , to say that one was a OOV OOV in the OOV OOV and a OOV " OOV of the OOV of OOV and to OOV about OOV OOV of the OOV OOV .
I do not know what one has OOV to do with the other , OOV OOV from the fact that Mr OOV OOV OOV to OOV us a OOV of his own OOV , but this is OOV not without interest OOV .
<P> OOV to the OOV of my OOV , the OOV in OOV OOV are OOV and we have OOV many OOV state quite OOV that if the question being OOV here is how OOV and OOV our aid is , then in the case of this OOV OOV it does actually OOV to be OOV OOV , our OOV OOV I OOV .
What concerns us , however - and what also OOV the OOV about the OOV and how it should be OOV in our group - is the fact that we know from OOV that this has not always been the case .
We call on the Commission to ensure that the aid - when the European Union OOV by OOV a OOV approach , OOV , OOV and people on the OOV - does not only OOV when the people have , for the most part , already OOV themselves or when the next OOV OOV is OOV to be OOV with .
The European Union 's OOV , both OOV and in its relations with its OOV , is OOV when OOV is OOV made available and aid is OOV , but because of OOV OOV the aid OOV OOV far too OOV or not at all .
<P> On the one hand , therefore , this is about OOV help for the OOV of the OOV , who need our OOV , but on the other hand it is also about the fact that we need to OOV in OOV that our aid is OOV if it OOV OOV in a OOV of OOV OOV .
That is why we are OOV that this OOV has been OOV OOV by OOV OOV .
We hope , Commissioner OOV , that the Commission will work just as OOV on this OOV as Parliament has .
As for Mr OOV , I hope that he does not OOV any OOV OOV OOV .
<SPEAKER OOV NAME=" OOV " > Mr President , OOV me OOV to Mr OOV , who OOV about the situation in OOV .
I want to make it clear that as part of our decision last year , OOV by this House , to increase our OOV in the whole OOV initiative - EUR OOV , we OOV to OOV it OOV , not just on the OOV countries .
The reason for this was that , as a OOV of OOV OOV , OOV was OOV in the OOV initiative .
We OOV to find a OOV OOV OOV European OOV OOV OOV to make it possible for the European Union to be OOV and support OOV .
OOV will OOV EUR OOV as OOV OOV from us because of this .
This is , of course , in OOV to what OOV is OOV from the OOV OOV OOV - and OOV OOV and OOV OOV as part of the regional programme .
<P> OOV Members have OOV concerns about the OOV OOV of the more OOV OOV part of the OOV OOV OOV .
I can only agree with the OOV .
I OOV have OOV this as a real OOV .
It OOV OOV one and a OOV years for the Commission services to find the OOV to OOV people to OOV to OOV to form the OOV to OOV the implementation of the regional OOV programme of EUR OOV .
This is OOV .
It is not just OOV , it is a OOV OOV OOV of different parties who do not OOV to each other .
This is OOV why I am still in the market for more OOV to OOV up those OOV of OOV which are OOV good OOV in the Commission .
<P> The situation today for the implementation of this programme is that these people have now been working in OOV since OOV OOV .
OOV the EUR OOV , we have OOV OOV and OOV the OOV in a number of the OOV OOV by the OOV programme of more than EUR OOV .
So EUR OOV out of EUR OOV are now set to work .
OOV are OOV OOV to OOV on the OOV .
<P> I still want to make the very clear OOV - which I OOV OOV who has OOV in this debate to OOV - between the OOV OOV OOV OOV to OOV and the OOV OOV work .
They are two OOV OOV OOV of OOV and this has to be OOV in OOV .
OOV has OOV OOV in the OOV OOV OOV , OOV , as I mentioned here , OOV OOV people to OOV to OOV .
But this is OOV enough .
<P> OOV me now OOV more OOV to the OOV situation in OOV OOV .
OOV course , the Commission fully OOV the OOV and OOV OOV in Parliament 's resolution on the OOV OOV which OOV OOV countries of OOV OOV , and in particular OOV OOV .
The Commission - President OOV , Mr OOV and OOV - OOV OOV its OOV to the OOV of the OOV and the authorities and OOV a OOV and OOV Community OOV to this OOV .
<P> As in the OOV , when it OOV OOV OOV after the OOV OOV through the OOV of a new OOV and OOV very OOV OOV and OOV aid to the countries OOV by OOV OOV , the Commission OOV OOV to help OOV OOV and OOV OOV to OOV the present OOV OOV .
<P> As OOV as the OOV OOV the Commission OOV aid OOV , OOV , OOV a field OOV OOV in OOV to go OOV to the OOV and he was there by OOV .
OOV also OOV this OOV for a OOV to be OOV to make an OOV OOV of the needs as OOV cooperation with other OOV and the local authorities .
It OOV OOV .
<P> On OOV I OOV that the first OOV in terms of OOV should be EUR OOV OOV .
This would OOV the things that we OOV would be necessary in any case .
OOV any OOV of OOV or further OOV , it was clear that OOV OOV , OOV , OOV , OOV aid and OOV OOV would be OOV .
We also were OOV clear as to the organisations we should ask to take OOV of this on behalf of the Commission , OOV a OOV of European OOV and the OOV OOV OOV .
We will OOV up these OOV decisions with further OOV , OOV on the OOV we get on what we are going to do OOV to other OOV and so on .
<P> OOV me OOV here that this OOV OOV once again OOV that OOV as such is OOV .
OOV people think that OOV and these OOV of OOV are much more OOV in our OOV OOV with all the OOV infrastructure we have , yet in OOV OOV the OOV OOV has been that more than OOV % of OOV OOV to the whole OOV is OOV OOV because of OOV to OOV , OOV OOV . <P> So the OOV OOV is OOV , often because the systems are OOV , not OOV very well .
For OOV the OOV in OOV OOV much greater OOV to OOV , road , OOV and so on than it would have done if the country had had OOV , OOV , OOV and more OOV infrastructure .
So OOV is OOV , and this has to be OOV in OOV .
For this reason , we are OOV more OOV to OOV OOV OOV as part of our OOV OOV .
<P> We are also OOV as OOV as possible the OOV for a OOV of resources available in OOV development OOV in the OOV and OOV OOV , including those OOV in the framework of the OOV OOV programme .
<P> OOV view here is that we need OOV resources for this .
It is not OOV to OOV OOV from the OOV OOV programme which has had enough problems already OOV to our OOV OOV , but it is an OOV that we have a OOV in place in the region which OOV of people who are OOV OOV in these OOV of OOV OOV .
OOV course , this is an OOV and we will OOV come back to the more OOV problems for OOV OOV when we get OOV the OOV OOV OOV .
<P> So I thank you for the very OOV support here .
We will come back on how to do these things .
<SPEAKER OOV NAME=" President " > OOV you , Commissioner .
<P> The debate is OOV .
<P> The vote will take place at OOV OOV <P> I now OOV also to OOV in their OOV who should be here not at OOV OOV , as OOV on the OOV programme , but at OOV OOV , OOV on when we are able to OOV the vote .
The President already said at OOV today that it would be OOV OOV , and it may be that it will be OOV OOV , and OOV on the result of the vote on Mr OOV 's OOV it may even take place OOV than that .
I would therefore OOV , in OOV with the decision of the OOV of OOV , that you OOV ask your OOV to come into the OOV as OOV as OOV OOV for the vote and help us to ensure that we are all here at OOV OOV <P> ( The OOV was OOV at OOV OOV and OOV at OOV OOV ) OOV OOV OOV OOV <SPEAKER OOV NAME=" President " > The next OOV is the report ( OOV ) by Mr OOV , on behalf of the Committee on OOV ' OOV and Rights , OOV and OOV OOV , on the initiative of the OOV OOV with a view to OOV a Council OOV on OOV of OOV with a OOV OOV .
<SPEAKER OOV LANGUAGE="FR" NAME=" OOV " > OOV me , Mr President , but I OOV that you had OOV an OOV OOV to OOV my report to a OOV OOV .
<SPEAKER OOV NAME=" President " > I have not OOV an OOV OOV , I was in fact OOV for an OOV OOV .
That is why I OOV OOV in OOV the debate , but OOV no one OOV to approach the Presidency .
<P> <SPEAKER OOV LANGUAGE="FR" NAME=" OOV " > Mr President , as far as I am aware , a OOV OOV was OOV to you OOV on behalf of the Group of the OOV OOV OOV .
OOV , I OOV that you have OOV it .
OOV , again , as far as I am aware , this OOV is OOV .
<SPEAKER OOV NAME=" President " > This certainly OOV that the President of this OOV is OOV OOV .
I have not OOV this OOV , but I take it that what you say is OOV .
You are aware of the OOV OOV OOV to OOV a report , we take a OOV in favour of the OOV , then one against , and then , if necessary , we OOV from the rapporteur .
<SPEAKER OOV LANGUAGE="DE " NAME=" OOV " > Mr President , I was OOV by Mr OOV , but I will OOV you the OOV of what he OOV to OOV me .
OOV who were in the OOV just now know what I OOV .
<P> If I OOV OOV , Mr OOV OOV his report to be OOV .
OOV I do not know why I have been given the OOV first .
As rapporteur , he has in fact not yet OOV us why he is OOV this OOV .
That is why it would be only OOV for you to give OOV the OOV first .
OOV I will give my opinion and that of my group on this .
<SPEAKER OOV NAME=" President " > As a OOV , we ask for a OOV in favour of OOV the report .
You were the first to OOV your hand , Mr OOV , you were the OOV .
However , I would , OOV , like to OOV Mr OOV to OOV .
<SPEAKER OOV LANGUAGE="FR" NAME=" OOV " > Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , in this OOV ' s OOV , the President OOV the House that the Mr OOV s report had been OOV to a OOV OOV .
At that point , I OOV OOV that the report that I had OOV on and which , OOV , was OOV adopted by the Committee on OOV ' OOV and Rights , OOV and OOV OOV , would be OOV OOV this OOV .
<P> However , in the OOV , I was OOV that most of the people who had taken part in this debate in my committee , and who I OOV would be able to OOV before the House , had OOV OOV their OOV as they were OOV to take part in the debate .
This OOV more than OOV of the OOV who were to OOV this debate on a matter on which we are OOV at OOV with the Council , since , in the legal basis , there is a OOV between what I OOV and what is OOV to the Council , and this is OOV to have OOV OOV for OOV of people who , every year , would like to OOV from OOV OOV in the OOV area .
<P> OOV , then , I have had to OOV the OOV of Mr OOV , OOV of the committee ; Mr OOV , OOV of the Group of the European OOV ' s OOV ; Mrs OOV I OOV , who was OOV to OOV and who is OOV of the Group of the OOV of European OOV , and Mr OOV OOV , who also OOV his OOV , being OOV to OOV , as well as two other OOV .
In these OOV , OOV a matter where we OOV all the political OOV to OOV a clear position , where it is a question of OOV conflict between Parliament and the Council , I OOV that it was important to have an OOV debate and a full vote .
That is why I OOV that this report be OOV OOV Parliament ' s next OOV .
<SPEAKER OOV LANGUAGE="DE " NAME=" OOV " > Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , in principle I support Mr OOV 's OOV .
I also support it on behalf of my group , because we believe that this is such an important issue - as Mr OOV has said - that it OOV the attention of the whole House .
OOV he has put forward a OOV OOV that many of the OOV who OOV on this in the committee and who OOV to OOV this OOV are no OOV here .
<P> What was right for the OOV report this OOV must also OOV to the OOV report this OOV .
But of course I should also like to OOV this by OOV that we cannot OOV that this debate is , OOV other things , about an OOV and OOV problem .
If we do not change our OOV and make both OOV and OOV working OOV here , then we will OOV this problem over and over again every OOV OOV .
<P> <P> In my opinion this can be OOV by OOV a OOV and OOV OOV system for OOV our work which OOV OOV OOV OOV .
In this specific case Mr OOV has a right to have better OOV than he has now .
<SPEAKER OOV LANGUAGE="DE " NAME=" OOV " > Mr President , of course I OOV agree with Mr OOV 's last point , but I should like this once to state quite clearly that , now that the OOV OOV has been OOV , there is a OOV OOV to OOV the OOV OOV too .
On the other hand , the OOV to this are far from OOV .
<P> On OOV , Mr OOV said that his report was too important to be taken on OOV OOV .
OOV , following Mr OOV 's OOV , this House made a OOV decision to take his report on OOV OOV .
OOV at OOV on OOV , the President of the OOV OOV that with the agreement of the OOV Mr OOV 's report would be OOV to OOV OOV .
<P> This OOV we were OOV with an OOV , out of which it OOV that the OOV and OOV reports would be OOV with this OOV .
This OOV OOV OOV against this .
At OOV Mr OOV OOV that he would be OOV and OOV for his report to be OOV .
OOV OOV was OOV , and Mr OOV OOV there and did not OOV .
This OOV Mr OOV OOV that his OOV had OOV OOV and now this OOV he OOV his report to be OOV .
This is OOV OOV like a OOV and OOV OOV , I really do have to say .
I should like very clearly to OOV this OOV .
Mr OOV , Mrs OOV and I are Members of this committee .
We can OOV our OOV on this issue , and we should go OOV with the debate .
However , I would hope that OOV could be more OOV in the future .
<SPEAKER OOV NAME=" President " > I would point out to the House that I have actually OOV the OOV OOV .
The OOV has , therefore , been OOV OOV .
We shall now OOV to the vote on the OOV .
<P> ( Parliament OOV the OOV to OOV the report by Mr OOV ) <P> We shall now OOV to the debate on the report by Mr OOV .
The vote will take place OOV after the debate .
<SPEAKER OOV LANGUAGE="FR" NAME=" OOV " > Mr President , I shall be taking more than OOV OOV , because the OOV from my group who have OOV have OOV OOV OOV .
OOV , I can take OOV OOV .
So , Mr President , I shall OOV as OOV as appropriate , because I believe that you do not OOV to OOV a OOV debate that OOV a full OOV of each OOV .
<SPEAKER OOV NAME=" President " > Mr OOV , I shall OOV the OOV of OOV .
You have been OOV OOV OOV and I shall OOV you to OOV for OOV OOV .
<SPEAKER OOV LANGUAGE="FR" NAME=" OOV " > Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , my report is OOV on an initiative by the OOV OOV OOV OOV OOV , who are OOV of what is OOV a national OOV OOV ; in other words , one OOV for no more than three OOV , which has been OOV by a Member State of the OOV area .
These OOV OOV are OOV their OOV OOV in the Member State that OOV their OOV .
<P> OOV current Community law , OOV , OOV OOV of the OOV OOV the OOV OOV , OOV OOV are only OOV to OOV through the OOV of other Member States in order to OOV the country which OOV the OOV OOV .
OOV their OOV in this country , OOV OOV cannot OOV any further within the OOV area OOV they have OOV what is OOV a OOV OOV .
This is OOV where the problem OOV .
It can take OOV OOV , if not OOV OOV , for a OOV OOV to be OOV , OOV OOV to OOV OOV OOV , OOV OOV of OOV OOV in some Member States , and because the OOV concerned has OOV in OOV out the OOV OOV to OOV .
<P> OOV , and this concerns OOV of people every year OOV the Union , a OOV of a OOV OOV and who has not yet OOV a OOV OOV , is in the least OOV position by OOV with other OOV OOV as far as OOV of OOV in the OOV area is concerned .
<P> The fact that a whole OOV of extremely OOV conditions must be OOV , in each of our countries , in order to OOV a national OOV OOV OOV this situation even more OOV , and , to my OOV , even more OOV .
OOV from OOV OOV OOV OOV , OOV for OOV OOV are OOV to a OOV OOV OOV .
They must OOV that they have OOV resources and , OOV on the OOV , OOV OOV a OOV to OOV that they have been OOV in an OOV or OOV OOV , or a OOV employment OOV .
<P> The OOV of the OOV OOV is OOV and is very clearly OOV in the OOV OOV .
The OOV is to OOV OOV of OOV in the OOV area for OOV of a national OOV OOV who are OOV their OOV OOV .
OOV of us , or so I hope , at least , OOV this OOV which OOV to OOV OOV of OOV for these OOV .
<P> OOV , the problem OOV not in the OOV itself , but in the way that the OOV OOV has OOV to achieve this OOV and the OOV of this in terms of the OOV OOV of Member States with regard to citizens ' rights .
<P> It is rather OOV that the OOV OOV initiative OOV OOV OOV OOV ) and OOV OOV ) as its legal basis , as both of these OOV to OOV and conditions for OOV OOV .
OOV , if the real OOV of the initiative is to OOV OOV of OOV for OOV , the OOV legal basis is OOV OOV OOV ) , which OOV that the Council shall , within a OOV of OOV years of the Treaty of OOV ' s OOV into OOV , OOV measures OOV out the conditions under which OOV of third countries shall have the OOV to OOV within the OOV of the Member States during a OOV of no more than three OOV .
<P> OOV and gentlemen , the OOV of legal basis is OOV an OOV OOV .
In OOV , the legal basis OOV in the OOV initiative OOV that the main OOV of this initiative is to OOV conditions for OOV OOV OOV by OOV them into OOV with OOV OOV OOV .
This means that , if we OOV the proposal as OOV by the OOV OOV , it would give any Member State involved in the OOV cooperation under the OOV OOV the right to be OOV of all OOV for a OOV OOV made in every other country of the OOV area , through what is OOV the OOV OOV OOV , and , as a OOV , it would be able to OOV the OOV of OOV by OOV that this country does not OOV .
In OOV , if we OOV these OOV , it would OOV that , through the OOV OOV OOV , the OOV government could OOV to be OOV OOV if OOV were to issue a OOV OOV to an OOV national OOV , and it would have the right to OOV to the OOV , without OOV ' s OOV , because OOV no one OOV which countries make use of the OOV OOV OOV and the Council OOV to OOV the OOV of countries .
<P> OOV , I OOV OOV to OOV the initiative of the OOV OOV in order to OOV it into OOV with the OOV OOV , as set out in the OOV OOV , which is to OOV the OOV of OOV of a national OOV OOV OOV OOV their OOV OOV .
<P> OOV , I support the OOV to OOV a OOV OOV OOV system , as already OOV OOV for OOV OOV .
However , I hope , and I believe that we should all hope , that this initiative should be part of a clear , OOV , OOV proposal from the Council and not part of an initiative which is OOV in OOV and OOV in its OOV , like this one .
That is why I shall ask the House to OOV the amendments that I have made with the full support of the Committee on OOV ' OOV and Rights , OOV and OOV OOV .
<SPEAKER OOV NAME=" OOV " > Mr President , I am OOV for the opportunity to OOV for the Committee on OOV .
This is not the only issue OOV OOV OOV OOV OOV where we have a problem OOV the appropriate legal OOV .
I am OOV , for example , of the OOV of the OOV OOV OOV the OOV of social security systems .
<P> The OOV OOV in OOV OOV of OOV OOV rights to OOV OOV as those OOV by EU citizens .
OOV we still have those who wish to view them as OOV OOV , rather than as people who have much OOV to the Union .
OOV why would our OOV be so OOV to OOV OOV OOV from OOV and OOV OOV ?
We believe we need political OOV in our OOV in this area .
The OOV of such OOV OOV OOV the OOV over the legal OOV .
<P> The Committee on OOV OOV the view taken by the rapporteur , Mr OOV , and OOV OOV for his OOV in this matter .
It was our committee 's view that we could OOV the number of such OOV with the Council in future by OOV the number of OOV national OOV in this area and OOV OOV for Commission proposals which go through an OOV OOV OOV .
I know that the Committee on OOV ' OOV and Rights , OOV and OOV OOV has already OOV this with the Swedish presidency and we must hope it OOV OOV .
<P> On the OOV issue , OOV being aware that not all Member States are involved in the OOV OOV , of course , it OOV to our committee that we should OOV the rights of OOV OOV into OOV with those of citizens .
This is particularly important where OOV , not OOV as it OOV in my OOV OOV for some very OOV reason , are OOV by a different legal OOV , and we have had a number of OOV on these issues which we OOV to our opinion .
We OOV it was also important to support the position of Mr OOV , as the need for this proposal itself is more the result of OOV OOV than OOV .
<P> It is our hope and OOV also that the Committee on OOV will OOV be OOV for an opinion in good time on such issues in future .
<SPEAKER OOV LANGUAGE="DE " NAME=" OOV " > Mr President , I should like first of all to OOV Mr OOV on his OOV report which OOV our full support .
We have of course OOV very OOV on this report in our Committee on OOV ' OOV and Rights , OOV and OOV OOV .
OOV OOV Mr OOV , I could not have OOV for a better time for this report to be OOV with , because this is an excellent time - OOV Parliament OOV is an excellent time - but I would have OOV you better OOV .
<P> But OOV of this , I believe that the OOV who will now take the OOV OOV of the OOV OOV are OOV able to make a contribution to this debate .
I should like to say quite clearly that both Mr OOV 's OOV on the legal basis and his OOV of the Council and the Commission 's approach to this area OOV our full support .
The Council and the Commission are OOV just as OOV on this important issue as we OOV did just now and as we have done this OOV OOV the OOV .
OOV OOV and OOV are concerned we are OOV with a OOV OOV policy where OOV OOV are put to us one after another - OOV by the Council , OOV by the Commission , OOV by OOV Member States - but where there is no OOV approach .
But this is also OOV what this proposal - which is OOV OOV in OOV - is OOV from .
There is no OOV approach which OOV a clear OOV between OOV and OOV , which OOV both OOV and which OOV with the important issue of OOV , and all of this OOV OOV to problems .
These problems are then once again OOV by the back OOV by means of OOV OOV , and they are not OOV for good : these are OOV .
<P> If this initiative really does make the OOV of those people who have a OOV OOV in the European Union OOV then I welcome it .
But you cannot OOV OOV with OOV .
The way in which we have OOV this important field in the last few years - and OOV still do so - cannot be OOV to continue .
That is why I believe that Mr OOV 's OOV OOV are more than OOV .
OOV OOV of OOV in the interests of people , OOV .
OOV OOV where OOV OOV , OOV .
OOV of course OOV OOV for OOV OOV within the European Union .
But we call on the Council and the Commission OOV to OOV from OOV OOV to a OOV , OOV policy in this area and to present an OOV , OOV OOV through which we can OOV OOV by OOV .
<SPEAKER OOV LANGUAGE="DE " NAME=" OOV " > Mr President , I should like to OOV my OOV .
OOV we were OOV this OOV and I would have had to OOV my OOV with the OOV , " Mr President , OOV OOV , " because OOV OOV OOV were present , Mr OOV said that if there were no other OOV there from his group OOV from OOV , he would take over all of the OOV Group 's OOV time .
This would have OOV that we would have had to OOV to Mr OOV for a whole OOV OOV .
OOV that OOV
<P> <P> OOV this OOV has OOV from us and we can OOV to the issue OOV by Mr OOV .
Mr OOV , OOV , which you OOV about - one of your OOV OOV - has OOV to do with what we are OOV today , although I do OOV that we need to OOV about OOV .
<P> OOV me first of all to say to the Council that we are OOV with an initiative of the OOV Government , and OOV in the Committee on OOV ' OOV and Rights , OOV and OOV OOV we have OOV OOV Member States taking OOV time and again , and we have then OOV that the Member States OOV OOV to be OOV about their OOV of legal basis .
For once I will OOV to take up something which Mr OOV said .
There is no OOV plan , particularly in the Council .
That is why the Council would be better OOV to OOV Commissioner OOV 's OOV plan , which is actually available , OOV of OOV most of his OOV .
I say this as a point of principle to the Member States and the Council itself .
<P> OOV second point is , why is there no OOV plan ?
There is no OOV plan for one OOV reason .
OOV in the European Union as far as OOV of OOV is concerned , to the OOV that it is OOV by the OOV OOV of the Member States , is OOV - not in all of the Member States but in the OOV OOV of them - by a OOV OOV , because in principle most OOV in the European Union have as their OOV the OOV of OOV of OOV and not the OOV of OOV of OOV , which , OOV , is OOV as one of the OOV OOV OOV in the Treaty OOV the European Community .
<P> We are OOV with a OOV OOV plan because we OOV about the OOV OOV of services , OOV and OOV , and from OOV to uranium they can OOV OOV OOV in Europe .
It is only people who are subject to OOV in the European Union .
They are OOV to these OOV because of a OOV OOV .
OOV Mr OOV OOV about OOV of OOV , he OOV means people from the OOV OOV or OOV OOV .
But I am OOV , say , about an OOV OOV who OOV a OOV at a OOV OOV , OOV a OOV OOV for the OOV OOV of OOV and who , when he OOV to give a OOV OOV at the OOV in OOV has to OOV for a OOV , which he is OOV still OOV for because the OOV or OOV authorities are not making progress on it .
This is because of the OOV and - for the OOV of a OOV plan - very OOV OOV OOV in the Member States .
<P> I am OOV about the OOV who is OOV from a OOV to the EU by a OOV which has OOV in various different OOV .
OOV is OOV to the same OOV OOV , which OOV OOV not to OOV at all in a OOV market and in a OOV OOV .
That is why , in OOV with Mr OOV 's excellent report , I call on you , when you are OOV the OOV of OOV and its OOV , not only always to OOV a OOV OOV against those OOV we OOV or really do not want here , but OOV to OOV OOV that OOV of OOV is a human right and OOV that it OOV economic OOV in the European Union .
<P> ( OOV ) <SPEAKER OOV LANGUAGE="FR" NAME=" OOV " > OOV and gentlemen , the OOV initiative that we are OOV today once again OOV the importance of OOV all the measures on OOV OOV which present the problem of OOV up OOV .
OOV the OOV OOV that OOV OOV have not OOV and that they will even increase over the OOV years .
OOV , the problem of OOV OOV of OOV OOV within the OOV area will again OOV its OOV and become even more OOV .
<P> OOV , the citizens of Europe OOV a clear and OOV OOV policy on OOV .
The OOV of OOV OOV of the OOV OOV is the OOV OOV of the OOV initiative .
A OOV of a OOV OOV should not OOV OOV rights than a OOV who OOV a OOV OOV .
The issue is to OOV the OOV OOV of OOV who OOV OOV OOV , OOV OOV they OOV .
<P> We should be aware that , OOV , OOV OOV may only OOV through the OOV of another Member State in order to OOV the country which OOV their OOV OOV .
OOV then on , they can no OOV OOV OOV within the OOV area OOV they have OOV a OOV OOV .
<P> This is where the OOV OOV .
In terms of the principle of OOV OOV , OOV OOV with a OOV OOV are in the most OOV position , even OOV they might have had to OOV OOV OOV or even years to OOV the OOV .
<P> OOV , the OOV of the OOV initiative OOV the problem of OOV OOV , a problem which OOV in particular when citizens of the Union OOV OOV OOV .
OOV not therefore OOV those who OOV a OOV OOV as already OOV so that they can OOV the same right to OOV of OOV ?
As Mr OOV also OOV , the legal basis of the proposal could have been OOV in a different way so that it OOV all OOV mentioned in these OOV .
<P> OOV OOV up , it OOV right to OOV an OOV and OOV initiative OOV to a matter as OOV as Community OOV policy .
In order to respect and fully OOV Community OOV OOV , we must OOV OOV legislation on rights to OOV of OOV , OOV and OOV .
<P> The only way to OOV a OOV Europe being OOV is to make our OOV OOV policy OOV more OOV .
The current system does OOV to OOV the OOV OOV , on the OOV , it OOV OOV of OOV of OOV OOV to OOV .
<SPEAKER OOV NAME=" OOV " > Mr President , I OOV agree with Mr OOV .
This is a really important issue which OOV to the whole OOV of why we have the European Union .
The OOV OOV of the Union are OOV , respect for democracy , human rights , and if you OOV OOV of OOV , if you OOV people because they have OOV for a OOV or they OOV a particular OOV of OOV , I believe you OOV the OOV OOV of the Union .
That is why I welcome the OOV OOV of Mr OOV 's report .
It is a OOV report and , as he said quite OOV , it is OOV to OOV of people .
But even if it was OOV to only one OOV , we would still be OOV , I am OOV , years , OOV , after the time when we should have OOV .
It is , as he said , a means to achieve a OOV and I welcome his legal basis of OOV OOV OOV ) .
<P> I OOV Mr OOV 's concerns and his amendments OOV OOV of OOV for those OOV a OOV OOV .
I welcome his OOV of the OOV proposals .
There is a real need for these proposals .
We must OOV people OOV and with OOV and OOV the OOV of OOV OOV .
<P> OOV Member States will have OOV , but we must OOV that change is OOV and that people must not be OOV in terms of their OOV of OOV by OOV and OOV OOV OOV .
<P> I OOV Mr OOV on an OOV and OOV approach , with measures that OOV OOV of OOV for OOV OOV on Member State OOV for a OOV OOV of three OOV .
This is a OOV .
We should welcome it and therefore welcome his report .
<P> Finally , OOV this report will at some time OOV us in this OOV and in the Union to have a OOV and OOV debate on OOV and OOV issues , OOV from the OOV of OOV and OOV .
I welcome Mr OOV 's report .
<SPEAKER OOV NAME=" OOV " > Mr President , on behalf of the Commission , I should like to OOV my OOV on the OOV and OOV work of the rapporteur , Mr OOV .
<P> The Commission OOV the OOV OOV by the OOV initiative to OOV OOV of OOV within the OOV area for OOV with OOV OOV OOV to the issue of a OOV OOV with OOV OOV to a OOV .
<P> However , the Commission cannot support the OOV legal basis , which has OOV OOV for the OOV of the OOV OOV .
The Commission OOV OOV your rapporteur 's position .
It OOV that the OOV legal basis for this OOV is OOV OOV OOV ) of the OOV Treaty , OOV OOV out the conditions under which OOV of third countries shall have the OOV to OOV within the OOV of the Member States during a OOV of no more than three OOV " .
<P> For the OOV of OOV with that legal basis , the Commission also OOV with your rapporteur on the need to OOV OOV OOV of the OOV for the implementation of the OOV OOV , which OOV the OOV of OOV , rather than OOV OOV .
The OOV OOV OOV OOV that OOV OOV are OOV on a national basis and OOV the conditions for OOV by OOV of OOV OOV .
<P> The only further point that the Commission might OOV to those made by the rapporteur is this : it OOV the amendments to the OOV OOV OOV as going far enough .
It is also necessary to OOV the OOV OOV so that OOV OOV can be OOV of the new OOV of the OOV OOV .
<P> Finally , the Commission can OOV its OOV of OOV OOV an OOV proposal for legislation as OOV the right to OOV in the OOV area to OOV OOV action that would not be OOV to OOV and OOV in the public OOV or OOV as to the law .
<SPEAKER OOV NAME=" President " > OOV you very much , Commissioner .
<P> The debate is OOV .
<P> The vote on the report will take place OOV after the OOV on the OOV and OOV OOV of major importance , which are about to OOV .
OOV OOV OOV ( OOV ) <SPEAKER OOV OOV " NAME=" OOV " > Mr President , this is the last OOV of vote of the OOV and if , with my OOV OOV and in OOV , I OOV in OOV to the end of this last OOV as well , I shall have some hope of not having put my OOV in it too often .
<P> That said , I want to OOV you that I OOV my OOV OOV about this report .
OOV is a young OOV and also a regional OOV OOV for the OOV ' OOV in OOV .
OOV OOV as a OOV was to vote for the report as it OOV , because it would OOV more OOV and OOV .
But as a OOV and OOV OOV , OOV said OOV should do , and OOV me to do , what was best for the citizens , and vote for it only if it was OOV .
OOV that is what I have done , Mr President .
<SPEAKER OOV NAME=" President " > We should like to thank the OOV OOV for their OOV on the OOV report .
<SPEAKER OOV OOV NAME=" OOV " > The directive OOV by the OOV OOV is OOV on the OOV OOV of OOV OOV as OOV as they are OOV by a Member State of the European Union .
The OOV OOV of OOV OOV this approach because , at a time when OOV OOV are already being OOV in various countries of the European Union , the new directive will OOV further OOV of the law .
<P> OOV has OOV that the OOV authorities are even OOV - all too OOV - to issue OOV OOV against legal OOV who OOV to OOV certain rules ( including the OOV OOV , OOV the OOV of the OOV to public order and national security .
The new law on OOV OOV OOV through the OOV OOV OOV OOV to this OOV .
<P> For these OOV , we OOV against the OOV report .
<SPEAKER OOV LANGUAGE="FR" OOV > The OOV report OOV that the OOV of a OOV OOV who is OOV a OOV OOV should OOV the same rights to OOV of OOV as the OOV of a OOV OOV .
This OOV an OOV on the OOV initiative which OOV that a OOV OOV should OOV the same rights in terms of OOV as a OOV OOV .
<P> In OOV , when , on the OOV of OOV OOV , OOV OOV OOV OOV , the European Parliament OOV that these be OOV , OOV OOV towards citizens of OOV countries " .
<P> OOV , such OOV has been made OOV by the OOV OOV and by OOV policy on OOV .
OOV are OOV by OOV OOV that OOV with a OOV OOV of OOV and OOV have to OOV their OOV .
European OOV OOV OOV to " the OOV OOV " or OOV in the OOV OOV OOV .
In OOV to the OOV number of OOV OOV , an OOV number of OOV OOV have been OOV OOV .
A good deal of OOV OOV on in OOV because so few OOV are OOV .
This OOV OOV of OOV from the OOV OOV has no OOV OOV to OOV them OOV OOV and no OOV OOV to OOV OOV OOV .
<P> The OOV report OOV OOV that there is a OOV of OOV and OOV OOV when it OOV to OOV and OOV in Europe .
That is why I shall vote in its favour .
OOV OOV OOV of the OOV <SPEAKER OOV NAME=" President " > That OOV the OOV .

I should like to OOV the European Parliament ' s OOV OOV to the OOV of the OOV and to OOV our OOV for the OOV OOV of those OOV in this OOV .
<P> OOV , all we can do is to OOV our OOV of OOV and OOV OOV of this OOV OOV .
<P> At the same time , OOV me welcome to the OOV ' OOV Mr OOV OOV OOV and Mr OOV OOV , OOV the OOV of the OOV OOV and the OOV OOV OOV OOV OOV of the OOV OOV .
They have come to present to the European OOV the agreement for OOV and against OOV OOV by their political parties on OOV OOV 2000 , to which many trade OOV , OOV ' OOV and OOV peace OOV , OOV OOV , were OOV .
<P> OOV OOV is all the more OOV , gentlemen , since OOV OOV OOV that all the present and future OOV to this agreement will be OOV by their OOV .
OOV be OOV that you can OOV on the European Parliament ' s OOV .
<P> OOV and gentlemen , I OOV you to OOV a OOV ' s OOV .
<P> ( The House OOV and OOV a OOV ' s OOV ) <P> <SPEAKER OOV NAME=" President " > OOV and gentlemen , I have a OOV to make .
<P> The President of the Court of OOV OOV of the European OOV OOV an order on OOV OOV in which he set OOV the decision of the European Parliament of OOV OOV 2000 OOV the OOV Government ' s OOV OOV the OOV of OOV OOV OOV 's OOV .
<P> The order OOV that Mr OOV OOV should OOV Parliament and , of course , it is my responsibility to OOV this OOV decision OOV .
<P> OOV , I have OOV the Committee on OOV OOV and the OOV OOV for an opinion on what action the European Parliament should take in respect of this matter .
I have already OOV one new OOV : the President of the Court of OOV OOV has OOV upon the European Parliament OOV OOV in OOV to a OOV OOV the OOV of the European Parliament .
If this decision were to be OOV , the OOV OOV case would be a further OOV to OOV the OOV of the European OOV over national OOV <SPEAKER OOV NAME=" OOV OOV " > Madam President , when , at your OOV , I OOV the OOV of the European Parliament in OOV , I OOV OOV OOV ' s OOV OOV , when OOV out of the OOV by the OOV , " I will come back " .
<P> OOV OOV , having OOV , I can today say , " I am back OOV " <P> The Court of OOV has indeed OOV me as a OOV Member of the European Parliament , OOV the OOV basis of my OOV .
OOV , the House must be aware that , on the OOV of a OOV OOV OOV during the OOV OOV , the OOV Government OOV OOV OOV OOV has , for three years , OOV all legal OOV , OOV a OOV OOV OOV against me with a view to OOV themselves of a political OOV in Parliament , even OOV I had the OOV of OOV of OOV .
It is , I believe , this OOV OOV , in OOV with the OOV of the law and of OOV OOV , OOV , which OOV the Court to make its OOV .
I am certain that all OOV will OOV at this OOV and just decision .
<P> <SPEAKER OOV LANGUAGE="FR" NAME=" OOV " > I OOV to you OOV , Madam President , because the OOV OOV country in the world , OOV , is going through a particularly OOV OOV , and I think it would be appropriate for Parliament to OOV its OOV of OOV by the OOV authorities and people at this time , and I would ask you , with your OOV , to OOV a OOV ' s OOV .
<SPEAKER OOV NAME=" President " > OOV you , Mr OOV .
<P> I did of course OOV a OOV to this OOV to the OOV authorities OOV .
OOV you for your OOV , which , I believe , is the same as the OOV Mrs OOV OOV to make .
I will OOV OOV you to OOV a OOV ' s OOV in OOV of the OOV of this OOV OOV .
<P> ( The House OOV and OOV a OOV ' s OOV ) <SPEAKER OOV NAME=" OOV > Madam President , thank you very much for that OOV of OOV , which is what I OOV to OOV about OOV OOV .
<P> <SPEAKER OOV NAME=" OOV " > Madam President , I OOV OOV OOV OOV OOV ) , OOV OOV ) and OOV OOV ) of our OOV of OOV to ask whether you or your services have OOV a OOV from the OOV Government OOV you that the OOV OOV has OOV to change one of three OOV on its OOV , which would OOV the OOV of OOV OOV in the OOV OOV region in the European OOV last OOV .
<P> The change would be to OOV the OOV of Mr OOV OOV OOV and OOV it with Mr OOV OOV , the OOV OOV , who is here with us today in the public OOV .
<P> You will no OOV know that the system of OOV OOV was used for the first time in the OOV in the last European OOV and the people who OOV in these OOV OOV for a OOV OOV OOV they agreed with , not for an OOV .
OOV if no OOV has been OOV you could OOV the OOV Government to ask for their OOV , legal position .
<P> Finally , under OOV OOV OOV ) , I ask that the committee responsible , mentioned in this OOV , look into the OOV of Mr OOV OOV to see whether he has , in fact , OOV in OOV with the OOV of OOV OOV OOV , as OOV in our OOV of OOV .
<SPEAKER OOV NAME=" OOV OOV " > Madam President , OOV OOV of our OOV of OOV OOV that we all OOV here as OOV , not as OOV of political parties and we do not take OOV from OOV .
<P> ( OOV from the OOV and OOV ) The OOV of democracy is that OOV have OOV rights against the state .
The OOV , I am OOV to say , are now OOV to OOV a new OOV that political parties have OOV over OOV .
That is the OOV of OOV and that is why I OOV them .
<P> ( OOV from the OOV and OOV ) <SPEAKER OOV NAME=" OOV " > Madam President , Mr OOV OOV is OOV OOV when he OOV attention to OOV OOV , but what he OOV is that the OOV in OOV OOV place under OOV OOV .
No OOV OOV for Mr OOV OOV , or indeed for me or for Mr OOV .
They OOV for a OOV OOV and Mr OOV OOV OOV OOV as fully in support of the OOV OOV , its OOV and its European policy .
OOV has now OOV OOV that position and he is therefore OOV the OOV rights of the OOV of the OOV OOV , over OOV % of OOV OOV OOV .
<P> I call on Mr OOV OOV to OOV .
<SPEAKER OOV NAME=" President " > OOV this OOV debate is very OOV , Mr OOV , we do have an extremely important Commission OOV on economic and social OOV .
<SPEAKER OOV OOV " NAME=" OOV > Madam President , I shall be very OOV , but I too wish to OOV on the subject of OOV .
This was an OOV OOV and the most serious OOV is the fact that OOV people were OOV .
In OOV to these OOV , which we can do OOV about , it has OOV already been OOV that there will be OOV OOV OOV and it will therefore be necessary to OOV the OOV of the European Union .
As Mrs OOV OOV , we hope this House will support us in OOV .
<SPEAKER OOV NAME=" OOV " > Madam President , it is the case that , although the United OOV OOV system is a OOV system , the OOV of those on the OOV OOV in the order in which OOV are OOV to vote for them .
OOV , it is the case that we are here as OOV as well as OOV a political position .
That is very important and it should be OOV that the United OOV OOV OOV was OOV those parties that OOV for the OOV that OOV should be on the OOV , not OOV the OOV .
<P> <SPEAKER OOV OOV NAME=" OOV " > I should like to OOV your and Parliament ' s attention to a OOV OOV with which we shall be OOV in the course of the next few OOV .
OOV OOV , I and two of my OOV , OOV OOV and OOV OOV , were on a OOV to OOV where we OOV OOV OOV , their OOV and their OOV , together with human rights OOV in OOV .
A OOV number of OOV in OOV OOV are on OOV OOV , with some of them OOV to OOV because of the OOV Government ' s policy towards OOV .
I should like to call upon you , Madam President , to make OOV with the OOV authorities and OOV for a new OOV to be OOV upon between the OOV Government , on the one hand , and OOV ' organisations and the human rights organisations , on the other .
OOV , we shall see a OOV of OOV next OOV , for the OOV OOV has been going on for OOV .
<SPEAKER OOV NAME=" President " > OOV you , Mrs OOV .
I have certainly taken OOV of your OOV .
<SPEAKER OOV LANGUAGE="DE " NAME=" OOV " > Madam President , for OOV of a OOV OOV , I am in a position to give this issue my OOV support .
The OOV before OOV , I had the opportunity to OOV to OOV ' s OOV of OOV , and I made OOV aware of the OOV OOV of the situation .
I would therefore ask you to take action OOV .
<SPEAKER OOV OOV " NAME=" OOV OOV " > Madam President , I wish to OOV my OOV to those of the OOV who OOV the issue of the OOV that OOV place in OOV last OOV .
In order to OOV some OOV into what OOV , we need only OOV the following in OOV : last OOV was the OOV of the OOV and last OOV and OOV were the OOV in OOV OOV .
These OOV OOV that all of the country ' s OOV to OOV the OOV OOV .
OOV , OOV OOV so OOV that OOV OOV and OOV OOV as a result .
We therefore need to make a much greater OOV than might be OOV necessary , because the situation has been OOV OOV .
<P> <SPEAKER OOV OOV NAME=" OOV " > Madam President , I too would like to OOV an opinion on the issue OOV by Mrs OOV .
I was a OOV of the OOV , as OOV OOV said , and like the OOV of the OOV , I too was OOV OOV in OOV of the OOV of the political OOV because , although they did indeed OOV us to help their OOV , we were OOV to OOV .
I am OOV that , OOV OOV OOV , by both my OOV Member Mr OOV and me , still no OOV have been made to the OOV authorities .
I should like to ask you to make such OOV as OOV as possible , before we start to OOV even more OOV than we are OOV already from the OOV on the OOV by the OOV authorities in OOV 2000 .
<P> <SPEAKER OOV OOV " NAME=" OOV " > Madam President , ladies and gentlemen , in the last few OOV , various OOV of OOV , especially in the OOV and the OOV of the country , have OOV from OOV OOV conditions , with OOV OOV that has OOV to the OOV of human life , the OOV of OOV , OOV being OOV , OOV to OOV , OOV OOV to OOV , fisheries , industry and trade , the OOV of OOV OOV and the OOV of OOV and OOV .
OOV all of the OOV has , of course , been fully OOV yet , but the OOV OOV may OOV OOV of OOV .
This will OOV the OOV of Community OOV OOV OOV in order to deal with the economic and social problems OOV by this OOV .
OOV , in OOV to OOV our OOV OOV to the OOV of the OOV and OOV our OOV for the people who have OOV their OOV and their OOV , in which , I am OOV , all Members of this Parliament OOV , we ask you , Madam President to make OOV to the Commission , OOV it to provide , in OOV with the OOV Government and the local authorities , OOV aid for the most OOV OOV OOV so that economic OOV may be OOV .
I would also ask the OOV of OOV to OOV this matter in the OOV and OOV debate in Parliament ' s next OOV .
<SPEAKER OOV LANGUAGE="ES " NAME=" OOV OOV > Madam President , as a OOV OOV , I would like to OOV my OOV and OOV of the OOV and OOV of OOV
I would also like to OOV my OOV to the OOV of OOV OOV and to all the OOV of OOV of OOV and OOV .
On behalf of the OOV OOV OOV , I would also like to say that our OOV priority is the OOV OOV of human rights and , OOV all , the right to life .
<P> You have OOV us with the OOV agreement OOV by OOV s OOV OOV and the OOV OOV OOV OOV .
I must OOV you that this agreement does not OOV OOV new and that it OOV only OOV measures , OOV measures and OOV .
It does not OOV any OOV proposal to OOV the political conflict in the OOV OOV .
<P> It is now OOV years since the OOV OOV OOV the right to OOV but , OOV , the OOV Government has OOV OOV this OOV OOV decision adopted in the OOV OOV .
In the OOV OOV we need less OOV from OOV and less OOV and OOV from the state ; we need more OOV , more democracy and more respect for the OOV decisions of the OOV OOV .
<SPEAKER OOV NAME=" OOV OOV > Madam President , two OOV OOV , after the OOV OOV the OOV for OOV OOV and the OOV OOV to the OOV OOV of the political OOV of OOV OOV , OOV OOV OOV and I OOV : " The OOV of OOV and OOV for OOV OOV out a clear OOV .
The OOV of human rights will not be OOV OOV in OOV . "
<P> This is not the first time that OOV or OOV for OOV have been OOV or OOV by the OOV authorities .
In its OOV OOV report , OOV OOV OOV its OOV that there is a OOV of OOV in OOV .
OOV OOV of the Treaty of OOV . . .
<P> ( The President OOV the OOV OOV ) <SPEAKER OOV LANGUAGE="ES " NAME=" OOV OOV " > Madam President , OOV to this OOV that he mentioned , Mr OOV OOV to us about OOV .
I do not know if he is OOV to the OOV of OOV in OOV to the OOV OOV .
I am OOV he is not , because , as he OOV , the OOV region has the OOV OOV of OOV of any European region .
However , I would like to ask OOV whether that OOV also OOV about the OOV by the OOV of his OOV when he said to OOV : " OOV not OOV the OOV , OOV the OOV that be " .
OOV " the OOV that be " he is OOV to the OOV OOV .
I am OOV , Mr OOV , that in this respect " the OOV that be " means the OOV OOV , and the OOV OOV , and that the whole of this Parliament OOV that OOV .
The whole of this Parliament is therefore in a position to consider itself a OOV of OOV
<P> <SPEAKER OOV LANGUAGE="ES " NAME=" OOV OOV " > Madam President , Parliament OOV , because we have said it many OOV and today we have OOV it to some of you , that in OOV and OOV an agreement in favour of OOV and against OOV in the OOV OOV , we are OOV and OOV an agreement which OOV OOV the OOV political field , since it is an agreement in OOV of OOV , in OOV of life , in OOV of OOV .
There may be people who do not support this agreement ; there may be people who OOV it ; there has even been one OOV - the OOV OOV OOV , of course - which has OOV to OOV the OOV , and those people who might OOV it OOV , for OOV it .
<P> OOV , ladies and gentlemen , OOV all of this , we will always continue to OOV OOV .
We will always continue to OOV the right of any OOV of the OOV OOV , whether they are in favour of OOV or of OOV , to be able to OOV OOV our country without OOV .
I want no more and no less than Mr OOV does : I want to OOV OOV my country with my OOV , like they do , without having to take OOV .
<SPEAKER OOV LANGUAGE="ES " NAME=" OOV OOV " > Madam President , I wish to OOV OOV , following the OOV OOV by the OOV of the OOV OOV OOV and OOV OOV , to OOV my OOV and agreement with the OOV you have made , Madam President , on behalf of the European Parliament , in OOV of democracy and peace in OOV .
<P> OOV main problem in OOV is OOV , and OOV OOV such as those of OOV OOV are a OOV to peace in OOV and in Europe .
The fact that there are OOV problems in OOV OOV from the political OOV between the OOV government and the OOV OOV does not OOV us here in the European Parliament from OOV for peace and democracy and against OOV .
OOV OOV OOV and social OOV <SPEAKER OOV NAME=" President " > The next OOV is the Commission OOV on economic and social OOV .
<P> I give the OOV to Commissioner OOV .
<SPEAKER OOV LANGUAGE="FR" NAME=" OOV " > Madam President , ladies and gentlemen , before OOV to the main subject of my OOV on behalf of the Commission this OOV , I should , with your OOV , like to OOV one point very OOV .
<P> Madam President , I should like to OOV to the concerns OOV OOV by Mrs OOV , and by the OOV of State , Mrs OOV OOV and the OOV , Mr OOV , following the very serious OOV OOV which have OOV the OOV region of OOV .
As I am the Commissioner responsible for OOV with these issues , I wish to OOV them that we shall take OOV of every OOV of OOV OOV , just as we have done in other OOV in the OOV of OOV OOV OOV in Europe , in order to OOV by the OOV authorities in meeting the OOV costs of OOV , OOV or indeed OOV measures OOV by these OOV .
<P> Madam President , ladies and gentlemen , this OOV , the greater part of the OOV in the European Commission was taken up with OOV the report , the OOV OOV on OOV and OOV OOV in the Union , which it was my OOV to present , with the agreement of my OOV OOV , Mrs OOV and Mr OOV .
<P> I OOV this report OOV to OOV OOV of the Treaty , with which you are OOV , just as OOV OOV did in OOV .
It was as a result of this OOV report that the first information OOV available , which was used in OOV up OOV 2000 .
A OOV OOV of the report is available in three OOV at the OOV to the OOV .
The first part of the report which I am OOV OOV , for the first time , a OOV of the European Union in terms of OOV for the OOV countries of the Union OOV .
<P> The second part of the report OOV the OOV of other Community OOV on the Union ' s OOV .
It OOV the results OOV by the OOV OOV and the OOV OOV .
Finally , in the OOV OOV , the report OOV a number of OOV OOV or OOV for the future .
OOV me OOV , we have already made a OOV available to each of you .
The OOV report , ladies and gentlemen , will be available as of this OOV on the OOV , OOV with all the OOV OOV and OOV OOV OOV .
<P> There are two points I would like to make in my OOV OOV , before OOV to your OOV .
What are the issues at OOV in OOV within the OOV Union and how can we OOV these issues ?
<P> The first issue I shall OOV is that of a OOV environment OOV OOV and OOV change , which OOV each of our countries and OOV also the European Union as a whole : the issue of OOV and the OOV of new OOV OOV on OOV and OOV , the new OOV , the information society , and the issue of OOV OOV .
This is OOV by the OOV greater OOV on the part of our OOV citizens , as you are well aware , for our OOV to be OOV , to OOV the citizens themselves , and for OOV OOV .
<P> The second issue is enlargement .
We OOV the OOV of a European Union with OOV or OOV even OOV OOV , and what OOV clear from OOV this report OOV is that this OOV Union will OOV greater OOV , greater OOV , to an OOV OOV in OOV OOV of enlargement .
There are three OOV OOV you should OOV in OOV in this respect : with the OOV enlargement , the OOV of the European Union will increase by OOV % , and the OOV area of the Union will increase by OOV % , yet the Union ' s OOV OOV OOV will increase by only OOV % .
That is why in this report we OOV a third group of countries , which will OOV the OOV OOV OOV countries , which will OOV OOV % of the OOV of the OOV Union , where the OOV OOV OOV is OOV only OOV % of the Community OOV .
This is where the main OOV and the real change OOV .
OOV , with enlargement , the OOV of OOV of OOV policy is going to OOV OOV .
OOV the OOV million OOV of the OOV countries , OOV million will be OOV in regions where the level of OOV OOV OOV is less than OOV % of the OOV in the OOV Union .
<P> OOV , ladies and gentlemen , the OOV of extremely OOV OOV European countries into the European Union is not going to OOV the OOV OOV regions in OOV , OOV and OOV Europe - I am OOV of the OOV and OOV regions too - all of a OOV into OOV and OOV regions , as if by OOV .
The regions OOV OOV by OOV OOV are still in OOV , even if there has been some progress .
<P> There has been progress .
OOV OOV OOV in these regions has OOV OOV to the Community OOV .
It has OOV from OOV % in OOV to OOV % in OOV .
OOV with the help of the OOV OOV and the OOV OOV , the countries OOV by OOV policy have OOV economic OOV at a OOV OOV than the Community OOV .
OOV , within an OOV number of Member States , the OOV is not towards the OOV of OOV .
OOV continue to OOV and are even being OOV .
OOV OOV at more than OOV % in some regions , regions which have for a OOV OOV of time been OOV out in terms of progress OOV to their OOV OOV and OOV , and the employment OOV for women is OOV OOV points OOV that of OOV .
These are the OOV you can OOV in the report , in which we OOV the OOV OOV , the OOV of OOV , OOV OOV OOV , in some OOV OOV and some OOV areas .
<P> OOV can we OOV these issues ?
OOV and gentlemen , in our view , OOV policy must continue to be the OOV OOV in the European Union ' s OOV OOV .
We are part of a European Union which OOV to OOV its OOV of OOV .
This means we have to ask three OOV of OOV policy : why , for OOV and how ? <P> OOV ?
I OOV OOV it said that it is not possible to do OOV from OOV and that more OOV is OOV .
I am all in favour of greater OOV , but I am not and I shall OOV be in favour of OOV OOV policy to become OOV more than the OOV of OOV .
It is not enough just to OOV OOV .
We cannot OOV any form of OOV of OOV policy for we still have OOV OOV , OOV Community OOV and it is in our OOV interest to ensure the OOV and OOV development of a OOV of OOV for OOV policy .
The debate is only just OOV .
I do not have any decisions to OOV you , just some OOV , OOV .
OOV of these OOV is OOV on the OOV OOV over more than OOV years of OOV policy , and OOV me to think that there are OOV that are more OOV and more serious than OOV for the development of our OOV .
As I have mentioned already , there is the OOV issue , OOV , or even the specific issues OOV areas that are OOV in OOV terms ; by OOV , OOV OOV or other OOV OOV .
<P> OOV resources , too , must be taken into account , since that OOV employment .
OOV report OOV OOV down some OOV to OOV more high quality OOV , OOV social OOV and OOV OOV .
<P> Finally , taking this debate into OOV , ladies and gentlemen , the Commission could be OOV , when the time OOV , to OOV a more OOV and OOV approach to EU OOV development to the other OOV OOV , so that our OOV OOV of economic and social OOV would be OOV by an OOV OOV OOV and OOV support .
For OOV do we OOV OOV policy ?
I am OOV of two points in this respect , and these OOV are OOV by the Commission as a whole .
<P> The first is that we must continue to OOV support for the regions OOV the OOV OOV in development terms , for future Member States but also for current EU Member States .
The whole problem of priority support for the most OOV regions , of course , OOV the question of the level at which we shall have to set the OOV OOV for regions which are OOV too OOV .
<P> OOV second OOV is that the regions OOV OOV in development are not the only OOV OOV problems to which we must find OOV .
OOV regions within the OOV Union are OOV too .
If we are to have Community OOV then we must OOV measures that can be OOV OOV the OOV of the European Union for often , within a OOV state , there are regions that are OOV than OOV and OOV even within a OOV region there are areas of OOV right next to OOV OOV areas - as is OOV in the OOV OOV which I OOV a few OOV OOV .
<P> OOV and gentlemen , I think it is OOV possible to OOV implementation to the Member States , OOV the principle of OOV better than in the OOV , on OOV that we are OOV that Community OOV are being OOV and that European OOV OOV to go to those that have the OOV need .
OOV are we to OOV out this OOV policy ?
This can be OOV up in two OOV , OOV OOV and OOV management .
I have OOV my OOV to the Committee on OOV OOV , OOV and OOV , and I shall present my OOV to the Committee on OOV OOV - but it must be a OOV policy with OOV , as I have just mentioned , and with OOV OOV .
We did not , at this OOV , wish to OOV out OOV or OOV OOV .
It would be too OOV ; we would be OOV the OOV before the OOV .
OOV us first OOV OOV , OOV and European OOV .
OOV OOV will we have to find the resources to support these OOV .
OOV only OOV , one which I wish to OOV to the attention of the House , is that OOV the various issues OOV in OOV in OOV , one specific decision was that in OOV , at the end of this OOV OOV , by OOV up the OOV OOV to the OOV OOV , the OOV OOV and the OOV OOV , particularly OOV , and the OOV set OOV to OOV the costs of the first OOV OOV to OOV , we OOV a OOV OOV , OOV all these , OOV to OOV % of Community OOV
I see that OOV as a OOV point .
It will be a OOV OOV in the OOV of financial OOV that we shall have with you and the Member States when the time OOV .
<P> OOV and gentlemen , OOV the level of OOV in OOV to the increase in OOV , I think it OOV to say that any OOV policy will be OOV only OOV as it is OOV by OOV OOV .
OOV the level of OOV OOV , the OOV OOV is that the OOV of other Community OOV should also OOV OOV , as the Treaty OOV .
In terms of OOV with other Community OOV , there is still progress to be made , particularly in order to improve OOV .
I am OOV here of the common agricultural policy .
<P> OOV and gentlemen , thank you for your attention .
OOV OOV your OOV , I would like to OOV that this report does not OOV any OOV or OOV OOV .
It does not put forward any decisions , it OOV OOV the debate .
It is a OOV for information and OOV , a OOV of the European Union which OOV OOV Member States for the first time , and at the end we ask a few OOV and make a few OOV .
We shall be much more OOV in the third report in OOV , which will be OOV very OOV before the time when decisions are taken on the new OOV .
I OOV consider that this debate on OOV policy and this report OOV to the fact that OOV policy has been OOV and OOV , in OOV with the OOV of the Treaty .
OOV European OOV , OOV OOV between the OOV of Europe and respect for the OOV of the OOV of Europe : this OOV to be our OOV .
This debate on OOV OOV part of the OOV debate on the future of the European Union which was OOV in OOV and in which we are going to take part .
You may OOV on us in the next three years OOV up to the new OOV OOV in OOV in the matter of this OOV debate and of the specific debate on our OOV of the European Union , the OOV of the level of OOV between OOV and OOV .
<P> OOV you , and may I OOV you of the European Commission ' s respect for the OOV role that Parliament will OOV in these OOV .
<P> <SPEAKER OOV OOV NAME=" OOV " > Commissioner , as OOV of the Committee on OOV OOV , OOV and OOV , I have to say that the report on OOV is indeed an excellent basis for OOV and I OOV that we shall be OOV this OOV in the Committee on OOV OOV very OOV and that it will be a very OOV OOV .
<P> OOV , as a Member of the European Parliament , I have to say that it is clear from the report on OOV that there has been a OOV OOV in our efforts to achieve economic and social OOV in the European Union and that , as you OOV said , we have had more OOV with the economic OOV than we have with the social OOV .
OOV countries , such as OOV , have taken greater OOV of the OOV given to them than have other countries .
So the OOV which we should OOV out from the House today is that we need more OOV OOV on all OOV , especially on the part of the Member States and regions and , of course , we need OOV , such as the OOV OOV , so that we can use European OOV ' OOV more OOV .
<P> OOV , I agree that we need to start OOV on the OOV regions and countries of the European Union right now and again after OOV .
But we must not OOV one very important point : today 's OOV countries are not going to get OOV OOV and OOV because enlargement will OOV OOV the OOV OOV OOV OOV in the European Union .
That is something we must OOV in OOV if we are to OOV OOV into OOV OOV .
<P> I therefore think that we need to OOV resources , we need to make better use of resources , we need to call for better OOV both on the part of the Commission and of the Member States and regions ; however , that must not OOV us to OOV one OOV fact : that more people will want a OOV of the OOV after enlargement and as far as I am concerned , Commissioner , it is OOV that we increase the OOV of the OOV , that we increase the resources of the OOV OOV after OOV .
I should like to OOV your OOV on this .
<SPEAKER OOV LANGUAGE="FR" NAME=" OOV " > Mr OOV , I go OOV with your OOV , of course .
I OOV my own OOV in the same OOV and on the same OOV as OOV .
I should point out to the House that if the OOV OOV countries were to actually OOV the European Union right now , then the OOV OOV for the Community would OOV by OOV points .
This would OOV have the OOV OOV of OOV regions which continue to be in OOV OOV the OOV in one OOV OOV .
It would not , therefore , be OOV .
We are going to have to find some OOV for these regions which would OOV be OOV OOV OOV the Community OOV .
<P> Mr OOV , you OOV me more OOV will be OOV .
At this OOV , I can OOV only a OOV opinion .
We have not yet OOV the point of OOV the future OOV OOV .
I have only given you a OOV OOV , and a OOV opinion at that .
I think that the OOV of OOV % of Community OOV , which will be OOV in OOV in OOV with the OOV decisions , if we OOV together the OOV OOV , the OOV OOV , OOV OOV , OOV , OOV , OOV , as well as the OOV OOV in OOV to support the first OOV in OOV , for example , will give a OOV OOV OOV % of OOV
I see this as a OOV point .
OOV OOV further , my OOV opinion is that if we take on OOV another OOV countries in the state they are at present , then we shall not be able to OOV any OOV policy at OOV less than this OOV .
That is all I can say for the present .
<SPEAKER OOV OOV " > Madam President , I should like to thank the Commissioner for the open OOV in which he OOV to present his report in OOV .
It is the OOV of a debate - an OOV debate - that we want to be involved in as OOV .
The Commissioner and Mr OOV said that regional OOV will become OOV as great .
The OOV to achieve OOV will be greater : we have an OOV OOV of the Union and we still have OOV regions .
<P> There is a OOV OOV question which is , to use the words of a OOV OOV Commission President : " OOV we OOV the means to OOV our OOV ? "
That is not to say that the means have to be financial , but we must also look at other OOV .
It is clear that there will be a OOV on OOV OOV .
OOV I ask you , Commissioner OOV and your OOV , to look at the OOV OOV by other OOV , in particular the real and OOV OOV of OOV the OOV sector in OOV our regions .
<P> OOV you be OOV , Commissioner , that an OOV view will be taken , in particular by Mr OOV , the Commissioner responsible for OOV , to ensure that we have OOV sector OOV OOV to OOV regional OOV OOV the Union ?
<SPEAKER OOV LANGUAGE="FR" NAME=" OOV " > OOV you , Mrs OOV , for your OOV .
I can indeed OOV the OOV of the Commission , which I , in particular , OOV , and our OOV to take part , not just here but also in the national OOV , and in and with the regions , in as OOV a way as possible , in a major debate .
OOV whole OOV in the OOV is going to OOV in OOV the results of the OOV of this OOV and open the debate over the next two years , in an extremely OOV and open OOV .
The current OOV OOV is OOV EUR OOV OOV .
OOV again , I have OOV Mr OOV what I OOV of the OOV OOV OOV which we should not go if we wish this policy to have any OOV .
I also think , like you , Mrs OOV , that this European policy must OOV as a OOV , OOV other OOV and other OOV to OOV .
That is why I OOV great importance to OOV , the OOV of OOV funds , and the OOV of the European OOV OOV as our OOV .
I quite OOV , OOV , your concern for greater OOV with the OOV policy for which Commissioner OOV is responsible .
We have to find a way forward which OOV OOV with the OOV , especially in terms of the rules of OOV , and regional policy .
<P> OOV OOV , Mrs OOV , OOV me OOV my OOV OOV that we shall not achieve OOV and OOV in Europe OOV by OOV on the OOV of the market , on OOV and OOV or on a OOV OOV OOV policy .
I do not believe that OOV OOV can help the OOV regions OOV to be the OOV or that it can help OOV the OOV between them and the OOV regions .
That is why I shall OOV to ensure that we continue to have public OOV in Europe .
<SPEAKER OOV LANGUAGE="DE " NAME=" OOV > Mr President , Commissioner , I would like , on behalf of my group , to thank you OOV for your excellent report .
I am OOV it will OOV OOV , but also OOV OOV , and so I would just like to take this opportunity to OOV debate a OOV with a OOV question .
The current system will actually OOV in OOV OOV the year OOV .
OOV that we are OOV with the OOV countries with the OOV of their OOV in OOV , how then , can we make it clear to them that , even if they OOV under the current conditions , they cannot OOV on our being able to continue the system , in other words , how are we going to make them OOV that OOV of what they OOV up to now , they are going to have to OOV to an OOV OOV policy ?
OOV , OOV you could OOV a OOV the OOV which OOV OOV a good many regions by OOV to us how is it going to be possible for the regions which may OOV less support after OOV , OOV of the OOV we OOV , not to OOV support and OOV at a OOV ' s OOV ?
OOV can we make it possible for them - as has , in fact , been done OOV OOV the OOV out OOV - to achieve the OOV OOV , without their being OOV from the system OOV ?
You may be able to OOV quite a number of OOV with your OOV .
<SPEAKER OOV LANGUAGE="FR" NAME=" OOV " > OOV you for OOV this question , Mr OOV .
It is OOV the main question to be OOV in terms of OOV .
OOV me OOV , OOV , that the OOV OOV OOV made OOV to set OOV some EUR OOV OOV for the OOV countries OOV to OOV before OOV , to OOV them to be OOV into the current OOV policy .
OOV OOV , however , they will of course be OOV , like the current Member States , to OOV in a policy which will OOV be rather different .
<P> OOV report OOV OOV possible OOV to OOV for the regions which would OOV find themselves OOV the OOV OOV as OOV as we OOV a number of very OOV countries into the Union , and all I can do at this OOV is OOV these OOV .
The first OOV is to continue to OOV the OOV OOV of OOV % of Community OOV which is the current OOV OOV which regions are OOV for OOV OOV OOV , and therefore a greater OOV of OOV .
The second OOV is to OOV this OOV % OOV with a OOV policy over a set OOV , OOV by a OOV OOV of OOV , in order to OOV the OOV for regions which , OOV , would OOV find themselves OOV that OOV .
A third OOV is to OOV the OOV OOV OOV % to make more regions OOV .
In that case , we should OOV have to OOV the issue of OOV .
The OOV OOV is to have two OOV , one for regions OOV within the Union and one for the regions of countries OOV the Union .
I am not in a position , OOV do I have any wish , to OOV the matter right now .
I am here to OOV to your OOV .
I shall be OOV to the OOV of the Member States , and the OOV of OOV and OOV OOV of these regions .
In the end , OOV , we shall have to OOV for one of these OOV OOV .
<SPEAKER OOV LANGUAGE="DE " NAME=" OOV " > Mr President , Commissioner , you said that in the future , the main OOV of OOV will OOV in the OOV and that a OOV policy of this OOV will only be possible if there are OOV means available .
OOV you agree that we also need to OOV OOV time for this , because we know from OOV that it OOV time to OOV regions ?
OOV can we OOV on the Commission having the OOV to OOV both time and OOV , in order to OOV the OOV of the OOV policy ?
EUR OOV OOV are available in OOV OOV for the year OOV .
OOV it not make OOV to OOV this with a view to OOV OOV in the OOV , even before enlargement OOV place ?
OOV do you OOV on this ? <SPEAKER OOV LANGUAGE="FR" NAME=" OOV " > Mrs OOV , we do need time .
In the report I even mentioned the fact that for the countries which are OOV in the OOV OOV within the European Union , the regions OOV OOV OOV in development , it would take another OOV to OOV this OOV .
I OOV out that it would take OOV , and I can only make a OOV OOV , two OOV for the countries OOV to OOV us in OOV OOV .
I OOV with your view that we shall be able to make a greater OOV of enlargement and the OOV OOV of these countries if we make the best possible OOV at this OOV .
That is why , OOV my OOV OOV , Mr OOV and Mr OOV , who are responsible , OOV , for the OOV programme and the OOV programme , OOV I OOV am responsible for the OOV programme for the environment and transport , I am OOV to OOV that this OOV is used OOV , and that part of the OOV OOV OOV with these funds is used to set up OOV OOV .
This is the real OOV of the OOV countries OOV regional OOV have not OOV for very long .
The OOV in OOV have only been in OOV for two years .
We must therefore support the OOV OOV by means of these OOV OOV .
OOV , I OOV OOV an opportunity to OOV local OOV within the current Union to set up OOV OOV and OOV cooperation OOV with OOV country regions in order to OOV more OOV cooperation on the human level within each OOV OOV .
We OOV great importance , therefore , to OOV these OOV funds as OOV as possible .
I cannot , however , make any OOV , Mrs OOV , as to what we shall do with the OOV OOV in OOV after OOV - I mentioned OOV EUR OOV OOV - if these countries do not OOV in OOV .
For the time being the funds have been set OOV to OOV for those OOV that do actually take place .
In OOV to your question , however , I should like to point out that we have OOV OOV and that these are what we should be OOV , when the time OOV , to OOV OOV through OOV .
<SPEAKER OOV LANGUAGE="ES " OOV OOV " > Commissioner , I agree that there can be no OOV without economic and social OOV , and that there can be no OOV without means .
I also agree that the OOV OOV used have been OOV and positive .
OOV specific question is therefore : is enlargement possible without an OOV OOV on the part of the European Union - from the OOV of the first OOV - OOV and OOV this OOV OOV ?
<P> OOV , Commissioner , I must say that there is OOV in certain European regions and some of your OOV do not provide any OOV , although it is OOV that we are in a OOV of a very OOV OOV .
However , for this very reason I believe it is necessary to OOV something OOV .
You say that we have to find a OOV for those regions which are OOV OOV funds , especially the OOV OOV regions .
I would like you to be more specific , Commissioner .
What is going to OOV , OOV to your OOV , to OOV OOV , OOV , OOV , OOV , regions of OOV and OOV , and ' OOV ' which have just OOV OOV OOV ? OOV us be specific , because OOV in those regions will only be OOV by OOV .
<SPEAKER OOV LANGUAGE="FR" NAME=" OOV " > Mr OOV OOV , I do not have all the OOV at this OOV , and if I did , you would be OOV in OOV me .
We are only OOV the debate .
The OOV have been OOV ; the OOV have been OOV .
OOV these EU regions have OOV OOV OOV OOV .
I have OOV to OOV the OOV , because we cannot make OOV on enlargement and the OOV European Union , OOV the OOV OOV OOV of OOV Europe , without OOV at the OOV as they OOV .
This is a OOV report .
OOV I did not want to OOV OOV OOV before OOV the OOV and OOV the OOV which have to be OOV of the Commission proposals , when the time OOV , by the OOV of State and Government and by Parliament .
So there is a problem , but there is no need to OOV .
I should also like to say , in OOV to your specific question with regard to specific regions , OOV , OOV OOV or the OOV of OOV OOV , that it will OOV on the level of OOV OOV by OOV OOV .
What I do know , however , is that if we OOV the OOV of OOV OOV OOV - which I hope we do , since it is an OOV OOV - then the OOV Community OOV is going to OOV as a result of enlargement .
The OOV is going to OOV to a greater or OOV OOV , Mr OOV OOV , OOV to whether the OOV OOV countries OOV at the same time or not .
OOV again , then , there is no need to OOV .
The OOV will OOV not be as much as the OOV points I mentioned OOV .
The fact OOV , however , that some regions OOV OOV by OOV OOV , which are OOV OOV a good level of development even OOV this is still OOV OOV , are OOV to find that they are OOV OOV following enlargement .
We are going to have to find a OOV to this .
As I have said OOV , these regions are not OOV going to become OOV just because OOV European countries are OOV the European Union .
We are going to have to find a OOV OOV for these regions and continue to support them , and I have OOV a few possible OOV .
OOV of these , for example , would be to have a OOV OOV OOV , OOV to the system we set up for OOV and other regions , to OOV OOV out and a OOV OOV , particularly for those regions which were OOV to the OOV .
OOV then , even with the new OOV , there will still most OOV be , even OOV at the OOV OOV in the report , which I OOV you to OOV OOV , extremely OOV regions such as still OOV in OOV , OOV and OOV , and even in OOV , within the European Union of today .
A OOV , a OOV financial OOV , will have to be OOV for the OOV of OOV regions , and what I am OOV to do is to ask the OOV to OOV the help I need in order to find appropriate OOV when the time OOV .
<SPEAKER OOV OOV " NAME=" OOV , OOV > Mr President , this debate is our opportunity for a OOV OOV on the issues OOV us .
OOV question is quite OOV .
It is clear that enlargement will not just OOV problems for the OOV regions which we are OOV to OOV in the Union .
At the same time , if in this case the OOV market OOV , other regions will also OOV the OOV .
OOV , in all OOV , I am a OOV concerned about this OOV on OOV , for it may be that the problem of OOV OOV will OOV regions which we could OOV - although I do not know how - to OOV a OOV more to the OOV OOV of the system in view of the enlargement process .
I therefore feel that it could well be appropriate to set rather more OOV OOV for the OOV policy and I continue to call for the implementation of the OOV to OOV Europe to provide us with less OOV OOV and OOV a more OOV OOV , rather than OOV OOV us to this OOV of a OOV OOV process , which OOV the regions OOV from OOV to OOV .
<SPEAKER OOV LANGUAGE="FR" NAME=" OOV " > Mr OOV , as I said OOV quite OOV - you will OOV me OOV it - I OOV to OOV this debate OOV , OOV enough to OOV the OOV issues and our OOV of Europe , which is not just a OOV but a OOV .
I want us to OOV OOV and to OOV agreement on our political OOV .
OOV , once we have agreed on the OOV and OOV and the OOV of approach , we must give OOV the resources to OOV them forward .
So , OOV the OOV involved at this OOV would be a OOV way of OOV the OOV .
I know OOV well that we shall have to OOV OOV when the time OOV .
That is my first point .
OOV second point is OOV .
We must continue to OOV OOV between States .
You are well aware that there are States that are OOV OOV and OOV that are not .
I therefore feel that this form of OOV is quite OOV and quite OOV .
OOV , I must thank you for OOV in your OOV OOV that enlargement OOV problems and OOV but also OOV OOV .
This is also my view .
If you look at OOV over the last OOV years , with OOV , OOV and OOV , my own OOV OOV - and I OOV OOV the opportunity to say so in the public OOV I take part in - is that in the OOV and long OOV , any enlargement process OOV OOV more OOV than OOV and problems .
OOV OOV from OOV and OOV , it is just not in our interests to OOV people OOV on our OOV to continue to OOV in OOV .
OOV , of the OOV we have right next OOV to us , as in the countries of OOV Europe or OOV or the OOV OOV , always OOV to the same OOV .
OOV people do not have enough to OOV , they OOV .
OOV OOV in OOV are OOV to all OOV of OOV OOV , OOV , OOV , and OOV OOV .
It is therefore in our own interest , quite OOV from OOV or political concerns , to OOV this enlargement and to OOV the OOV for OOV progress .
I must also thank you for OOV me this opportunity to say that this debate must also OOV that in the great OOV of enlargement there are more OOV than OOV .
<SPEAKER OOV OOV " NAME=" OOV > Mr President , Commissioner , I have not yet had the opportunity to OOV the report , but the first report on OOV clearly OOV that the common agricultural policy was not OOV to OOV in the European Union .
The OOV 2000 OOV was OOV to OOV the OOV OOV in the OOV
I now wish to ask the Commissioner whether he can OOV us OOV about the report ' s OOV on the OOV
<SPEAKER OOV LANGUAGE="FR" NAME=" OOV " > Mr President , what I have to say to the Commissioner is far OOV .
OOV OOV , then , I would like to OOV that other OOV are used for the OOV of funds than just the OOV of OOV and of OOV .
OOV other OOV such as OOV OOV and OOV , OOV or OOV of OOV in terms of new OOV and OOV , and OOV OOV should be taken into account ?
OOV OOV , my last question : OOV the current situation OOV us to OOV OOV the OOV OOV before OOV ?
<SPEAKER OOV LANGUAGE="ES " NAME=" OOV OOV " > Commissioner , at the OOV of your OOV you OOV that the OOV OOV us are OOV and enlargement .
OOV with other OOV , I have just OOV the OOV OOV OOV in OOV OOV , where it was clearly OOV that with the problem of OOV we are OOV a new OOV , in which the European Union must OOV a OOV role in the world .
This problem of world social OOV must form part of our economic policy and , since you OOV to it , I would like to ask you what the European Union is going to do in this respect , because this is clearly going to have an OOV on our OOV economic problems and also on our OOV problems .
<P> OOV , Commissioner , I would like to ask you : to what OOV do you consider it OOV that States , such as OOV , which still OOV OOV funds , are OOV OOV OOV as an economic policy , at the OOV OOV <P> ( The President OOV the OOV OOV ) <SPEAKER OOV LANGUAGE="DE " NAME=" OOV " > Mr President , thank you very much Commissioner , you mentioned that we will also OOV new rules for enlargement , and OOV more OOV too .
I would like to ask a OOV of OOV on the subject of new rules and , as such , on the subject of new OOV .
OOV it really be OOV , indeed would it also be OOV in the future , to OOV OOV the support at one particular area , time and time again ?
OOV it not make more OOV to place more OOV than we have done OOV on particular OOV OOV , or OOV on particularly OOV areas ?
This would also OOV us to OOV the OOV in a more OOV way .
<SPEAKER OOV OOV " NAME=" OOV OOV " > Mr President , Commissioner , I am OOV to be able to say that I am OOV to OOV this .
I have not yet had the opportunity to OOV the report , but I OOV what you had to say about it .
I would like to ask you whether the Commission is OOV to OOV to see the Community OOV increase from the current OOV % , to OOV % , as has been OOV ?
I ask this because if we have the OOV that has been OOV , then we will have OOV .
OOV second question is : what will OOV to the OOV regions ?
You have not said OOV about these regions and they are of concern to me .
<SPEAKER OOV LANGUAGE="SV" NAME=" OOV OOV " > Mr President , I want to thank the Commissioner for OOV the OOV OOV in OOV with this report .
This is , of course , OOV what OOV policy and regional policy are about .
<P> I also want just OOV to ask whether the future debate will also OOV all other policy areas in the European Union which are important for regional OOV - education , OOV and social policy - so that it is possible to make use of OOV ' s OOV to get involved and OOV to regional OOV .
<SPEAKER OOV LANGUAGE="FR" NAME=" OOV " > Mr President , I am the one who should OOV for having OOV on too long , most of all to those Members of Parliament who were OOV to ask their OOV .
I shall , however , OOV at your OOV , as you know , in the OOV and OOV to come in order to continue this OOV .
<P> Mr OOV , if you OOV the report , you will see that we actually say that the OOV , OOV OOV are OOV , OOV OOV and OOV , has not actually become involved in the way we might have OOV in this OOV OOV policy , particularly because , in the regions OOV to OOV from OOV policy , OOV OOV are that much more OOV .
I have , therefore , OOV , OOV the fact that we should , as I said OOV , improve OOV through the common agricultural policy .
OOV of the means to do so would OOV be , in future , to OOV the OOV on the OOV development OOV of the OOV , which was OOV in OOV .
<P> Mrs OOV , I do not believe that we shall need to OOV the OOV OOV in the matter of OOV policy .
The OOV made in OOV OOV to me OOV OOV .
In OOV , we even made OOV for OOV , and now it is quite clear that no new countries will OOV in OOV OOV or OOV .
OOV OOV were set OOV to OOV with these OOV , and so I do not think we shall need a new OOV OOV .
You OOV OOV the OOV , if necessary .
We might continue to OOV OOV , Mrs OOV , but I should like to point out that we are not too far OOV the real situation when we work on the basis of the OOV of OOV , of OOV OOV OOV , because it can be OOV that where there is the OOV OOV of OOV there is also the OOV OOV of OOV , the OOV environmental conditions , and the OOV OOV of OOV OOV .
OOV , in some way , taking a OOV of the OOV OOV OOV of OOV , we have OOV an OOV OOV of the real state of the regions - and indeed it is no OOV OOV that my OOV , Mrs OOV , and all the other Members of Parliament who have given some OOV to these OOV all agreed on this OOV .
OOV , you know we can OOV this OOV with other OOV , especially OOV , but I would like us to OOV this OOV as I think it an OOV one .
<P> Mr OOV , I do not have OOV time to take part in a debate on OOV .
I even , as you OOV OOV , mentioned the new OOV of OOV policy OOV with OOV , which OOV the OOV which OOV OOV and OOV clearly OOV OOV years OOV , and which OOV them to OOV this OOV policy .
In the same OOV market , there is a OOV that OOV , trade and people will continue to be OOV in the same OOV and that the OOV regions are OOV and OOV further .
That OOV in the OOV market is OOV in a Europe OOV in an OOV of OOV .
That is why I think we do indeed need a OOV policy and support for OOV in future .
<P> Mr OOV , OOV , I am OOV to look into new OOV with you , particularly as far as development of the new OOV OOV policy is concerned .
I OOV , for example , about the OOV and OOV of the OOV OOV for OOV OOV , in which I am OOV to OOV OOV , in agreement with the Member States , whether every OOV OOV , OOV or OOV is or is not to OOV OOV OOV OOV .
I do not think that all this OOV is particularly OOV , and that is why OOV OOV policy , OOV regions other than the most OOV , could be OOV and more OOV , with OOV OOV to Community OOV or to regional development , the OOV areas , OOV regions , OOV regions , OOV regions or OOV OOV such as social OOV and the OOV against OOV .
I am OOV OOV to look into OOV OOV which are OOV in terms of their OOV within the Member States and which do not OOV the OOV of OOV OOV that the people of Europe OOV have .
<P> Mrs OOV OOV , I cannot go any further than I already have on the subject of the OOV OOV .
I have not OOV the OOV regions ; I even mentioned them in my OOV OOV .
There is a specific OOV on these regions .
As Mr OOV OOV , I do a great deal of work for these OOV OOV regions .
This is why , a few OOV OOV , the Commission OOV an important report on OOV or OOV in the field of OOV aid , and aid for OOV and fisheries which , OOV , have been well OOV by the authorities in these OOV regions and I think that , OOV to OOV OOV of the Treaty , we must continue to have a OOV policy for these OOV regions OOV because they are our OOV regions and , as such , our most OOV OOV OOV in the OOV OOV , the OOV or OOV the OOV OOV .
<P> Mrs OOV , thank you for OOV out the importance of the OOV OOV ' .
I also consider it important .
The OOV that we OOV to give this report , ladies and gentlemen , is " European OOV , OOV between OOV , regional OOV " , and , as you will see when you OOV it in OOV , I was OOV to OOV - since this was a concern of OOV - the need to OOV Community OOV with regional development and OOV , particularly in terms of OOV or the social OOV OOV OOV that Member States and national OOV will , of course , OOV their OOV on social policy .
I am working within the OOV of the Community ' s current OOV .
<SPEAKER OOV NAME=" President " > OOV you , Commissioner .
<P> That OOV this OOV .
OOV OOV Mediterranean region <SPEAKER OOV NAME=" President " > The next OOV is the OOV debate on : <P> the report by Mrs OOV ( OOV ) on behalf of the Committee on OOV OOV , OOV Rights , OOV OOV and OOV OOV on the common OOV of the European Council of OOV OOV 2000 on the OOV region - European Council OOV on the common OOV on the Mediterranean region OOV - OOV , and <P> the report by Mr OOV ( OOV ) on behalf of the Committee on OOV OOV , OOV Rights , OOV OOV and OOV OOV on the OOV from the Commission to the Council and the European Parliament : to OOV the OOV OOV of OOV OOV OOV : OOV the OOV OOV OOV ) OOV - OOV OOV - OOV OOV <SPEAKER OOV OOV " NAME=" OOV > Mr President , I would like to thank those Members who , through OOV , OOV and OOV , have OOV to what we consider to be a OOV forward in Europe 's OOV for the Mediterranean : the Mediterranean as a OOV not just to the OOV OOV but also to the OOV , a cultural as well as economic area , OOV the OOV OOV but also the OOV and OOV OOV at a time when OOV enlargement OOV us all to OOV specific OOV .
OOV must respect human OOV and the OOV of the environment and health .
OOV development must not OOV human rights or OOV respect for OOV .
<P> We all OOV that Europe needs a new OOV , OOV that in order to be OOV , common OOV must be OOV and OOV .
OOV , we must set OOV clear , OOV OOV so that , OOV by OOV , progress can be made towards development , security and OOV .
<P> On the one hand , a OOV would say : " OOV OOV the OOV who does not OOV to OOV great OOV OOV " but a OOV would OOV : " OOV OOV the OOV who OOV OOV OOV on OOV OOV and does not see or OOV the problems which are OOV OOV in the OOV OOV "
We have OOV to make our OOV OOV and OOV in the OOV and OOV terms .
In other words , we have put forward proposals which will give all the countries of the Mediterranean the same OOV and the same opportunity for development in a new OOV OOV with an OOV OOV and more OOV Europe , a OOV that will have to OOV for its international OOV in the OOV OOV with the whole of the OOV of the OOV world .
<P> OOV the environment and health , OOV for workers , OOV the quality of OOV in order to OOV the OOV and OOV a OOV - as long as it is OOV - market , OOV to the specific cultural OOV and OOV including OOV OOV of each country and OOV OOV of OOV OOV , a OOV to OOV us OOV from OOV OOV the OOV OOV and OOV OOV to our OOV countries which we have OOV in Europe because they are OOV , the OOV for the development of all the OOV of our Mediterranean OOV , including OOV for OOV the OOV and OOV of young people who have OOV or OOV in Europe in employment , OOV OOV , the OOV against the OOV of OOV and OOV OOV , OOV to the situation of working women and , in any case , to the OOV of all human OOV are OOV OOV forward , just as Europe 's OOV and OOV to do all in its OOV to OOV about peace and OOV respect in the OOV OOV must be OOV and given priority OOV .
<P> It cannot be OOV that , although the OOV OOV were a OOV in that they OOV a OOV number of problems , they did not do OOV to OOV them .
OOV , I OOV to say that the OOV have not OOV the proposals adopted at OOV : democracy , the OOV of law , OOV , social rights and an OOV policy to OOV OOV being OOV to OOV their countries .
A new policy of OOV trade , OOV OOV OOV , including European OOV , OOV and OOV OOV and OOV , OOV and environmental safety , the development of OOV OOV and the OOV of programmes to OOV OOV and OOV the OOV of OOV OOV into OOV OOV and the development of OOV are some of the many points which we have OOV .
At this point , I would like to thank the OOV of the committee and of the political OOV for their work , which was particularly OOV because of the need to OOV the OOV OOV .
<P> The time is now OOV to OOV OOV OOV , and OOV OOV are those which do not OOV from specific OOV or OOV OOV but from a policy 's OOV to OOV the needs of the citizens with economic and social concerns .
This is why Europe as a whole , not just Mediterranean Europe , to which , as an OOV , I have the OOV to OOV , must now OOV its OOV on the OOV and on the OOV and its OOV to these regions as OOV OOV , and OOV that if OOV , OOV progress is to be OOV , the OOV of the OOV must go hand in hand with human OOV .
This OOV was not OOV in order to be OOV as a OOV OOV of OOV : it was OOV to be OOV , and for this we place our OOV and our OOV in the Commission and the Council , so that their cooperation with the European Parliament OOV OOV and OOV .
<SPEAKER OOV LANGUAGE="FR" NAME=" OOV " > Mr President , last OOV , the Committee on OOV OOV , OOV Rights , OOV OOV and OOV OOV OOV me as rapporteur on the Commission OOV OOV ' OOV the OOV OOV ' .
This Commission OOV OOV a OOV OOV : to OOV the OOV of the OOV OOV and to put forward OOV in OOV for the OOV OOV to be OOV in OOV in OOV 2000 .
OOV OOV to OOV the OOV OOV of the issue , OOV me first thank my OOV OOV of the Committee on OOV OOV , with OOV I had many OOV that were extremely OOV for the OOV OOV of my report .
I should also like to say that I OOV this report taking into OOV what has already been OOV in Parliament , and Parliament ' s regard for the Mediterranean question , and at this point I would like to OOV OOV OOV to the work OOV out by Mr OOV OOV .
<P> In its OOV , the Commission once again OOV out the three main OOV of OOV policy , OOV : the OOV of an area of peace and OOV , the OOV of an area of OOV OOV through the OOV OOV of OOV trade and , OOV , the OOV of OOV OOV OOV the OOV of the region and the development of an OOV civil society .
Mr President , of these three OOV , only the OOV of a OOV area can be OOV to have actually OOV OOV the OOV .
So I was OOV to OOV Commissioner OOV OOV in this OOV OOV , since in the OOV of OOV OOV , OOV OOV cannot OOV about economic development OOV the OOV of OOV OOV OOV .
This is , OOV , a OOV area on European terms , as may be OOV by a OOV OOV : OOV OOV from the EU OOV to the Mediterranean countries OOV to EUR OOV OOV OOV year , OOV those OOV from the Mediterranean countries ' trade OOV with the EU OOV to EUR OOV million OOV year .
In other words , the Union ' s financial contribution to the Mediterranean countries OOV less than OOV of the OOV which Europe OOV from the OOV area .
<P> As OOV the OOV of an area of peace and OOV , the European Union does not OOV much political OOV , OOV the fact that in the countries of the OOV there is a OOV OOV for Europe .
There are many areas of conflict , which are OOV to OOV the OOV OOV OOV .
As to the development of an OOV civil society , it may be said that the people who actually OOV from the OOV programmes are OOV those who had OOV OOV with Europe or who have OOV OOV with OOV .
OOV society has OOV a clear OOV of interest .
Finally , the programmes for OOV cooperation , which are OOV to OOV OOV of civil society from both OOV of the Mediterranean to OOV for the OOV of OOV OOV OOV , have been OOV since OOV .
The OOV of OOV is rather OOV , then , and the OOV of OOV rather high .
OOV OOV the OOV OOV as a OOV OOV .
In my view , the OOV OOV of the OOV OOV which was OOV in OOV in OOV OOV has now given way to a OOV process which OOV any OOV political will .
<P> In my report , I OOV to present a number of proposals OOV to OOV this situation .
I shall now OOV the OOV major areas to OOV on .
OOV , I think that the OOV area must be set in the OOV of a OOV OOV approach .
OOV with our Mediterranean OOV , we must OOV the OOV of an OOV common market , OOV of OOV OOV with Europe ' s OOV , taking local OOV of development in the OOV into OOV .
We should OOV OOV the OOV OOV area into a OOV OOV market ' OOV OOV of all OOV .
OOV , OOV must be OOV at the very OOV of development today .
There will be no real OOV between the two OOV of the Mediterranean OOV the OOV OOV of people is put on the OOV .
This is why I feel that , in OOV years , OOV is going to OOV a OOV OOV of our relations with these countries .
We need OOV management of OOV OOV , including measures to OOV OOV OOV and the OOV which OOV from it .
We also need to OOV down OOV on OOV OOV , OOV to what the OOV OOV OOV is OOV OOV , without OOV to OOV OOV .
I also feel that we should OOV a OOV OOV OOV for those involved in the OOV OOV .
We should also OOV OOV to OOV development in countries of OOV .
OOV OOV to the development of the country of OOV .
I know that the European Union and the Commission are working OOV to achieve this .
I would OOV the Commission to go further by OOV OOV ' OOV .
In this OOV , I would also OOV OOV up a OOV OOV on OOV to OOV OOV OOV with a view to OOV proposals to the European Union .
We must also OOV the OOV OOV of the OOV OOV that so wish .
OOV to a proposal from Commissioner OOV which I find extremely OOV , the Commissioner said that certain regional OOV should be OOV to a OOV number of OOV OOV Member States and Mediterranean OOV on the basis of OOV which could OOV from one OOV to another .
I support this approach as I believe it OOV OOV , and OOV OOV , relations between the countries to the OOV and OOV of the Mediterranean who wish to go further together .
OOV OOV point is that we also have to OOV the management of the OOV programme .
The Commission OOV to be OOV of our Mediterranean OOV .
It must , however , be OOV that , OOV it is OOV that some OOV countries have OOV OOV , particularly because of OOV OOV , the OOV of OOV funds is OOV the result of the Commission ' s OOV to OOV these funds and to OOV on OOV OOV of OOV them OOV .
The OOV of human rights must also be made into something more than a OOV OOV of principle , for the OOV is actually to OOV the development of OOV OOV in the countries of the OOV Mediterranean , and not just to OOV economic systems which OOV into the OOV OOV OOV programmes .
OOV OOV point is that OOV OOV must be OOV .
The OOV in the OOV OOV peace process is an OOV to any OOV OOV , be it economic , social OOV cultural .
I think the Commission should take this situation into account .
<P> In OOV , I shall say that the OOV OOV of people , OOV and OOV cooperation are the main concerns OOV the report I am OOV today .
I think they should also be the main concerns of the Commission .
<P> <SPEAKER OOV LANGUAGE="ES " NAME=" OOV " > Mr President , as OOV of the opinion of the Committee on OOV , OOV , OOV , the OOV and OOV on the OOV OOV , I would like to OOV some of the concerns and OOV which have been OOV OOV in committee .
<P> OOV , I wish to OOV attention to the need to OOV cultural programmes , which I know is not what attention is OOV OOV to .
We know that the OOV OOV programme has been the most OOV of all programmes for cooperation with the Mediterranean .
OOV , we believe that OOV OOV OOV .
For example , where would OOV be without its cultural OOV , which has been one of its main OOV with the world and one of its main OOV of OOV ?
OOV , therefore , is one of the OOV which is most OOV OOV , OOV to hand , most OOV and which has OOV the most OOV in the field of Mediterranean development , which means that it can be OOV OOV to OOV between people and can continue to open OOV .
<P> At the same time we wish to OOV attention to education .
We believe that if a Mediterranean trade area does not deal with the issue of education , it will become an area of Mediterranean OOV .
OOV , the only way that there can be a social OOV OOV of being OOV into the OOV world and the OOV world is through education .
OOV , we believe that that is where a OOV and OOV OOV also can be OOV for OOV the OOV for future development .
OOV , the only way in which we can OOV our OOV about human rights is by OOV a better OOV and better OOV OOV .
We are therefore not OOV about OOV , but about OOV .
<P> OOV point that also concerns us is the way in which the Commission OOV to the OOV and OOV of the countries towards which the aid is OOV .
I believe that a OOV part of the OOV of the OOV programme is OOV to the fact that we are OOV a OOV OOV , which OOV Commission OOV .
What we need , however , is many small OOV .
We need to look to the OOV social OOV of the countries involved , the OOV , the OOV OOV , the OOV , the cultural field , and society itself , so that we can OOV on it for future development .
<SPEAKER OOV LANGUAGE="FR" NAME=" OOV > Mr President , the Committee on OOV , OOV OOV , OOV and OOV has on OOV OOV made OOV OOV to the debate on the European Union ' s Mediterranean policy and on OOV the OOV OOV OOV .
We OOV a major part in the OOV on the OOV OOV report that I OOV on OOV OOV 2000 , which was adopted OOV OOV by Parliament , as was , OOV , the OOV of the OOV OOV ( OOV OOV ) .
We would have OOV the meeting at OOV to OOV to the OOV programme , since it is the main OOV for OOV this policy and will be OOV a financial OOV of EUR OOV OOV for the OOV OOV , OOV funds from the European OOV OOV .
OOV , we hope that this OOV will be OOV , as European Union Mediterranean policy should not have to OOV because of the OOV that have been OOV OOV to the OOV .
OOV the OOV , OOV of the committee in which they are OOV , whether it be OOV OOV , OOV , OOV or OOV , or in Parliament , are OOV in OOV OOV the same OOV .
As far as we are concerned , we would like to OOV , first of all , the need to OOV a Mediterranean OOV , in OOV with third countries .
OOV , the need to OOV OOV cooperation that OOV to OOV OOV with local authorities and civil society , particularly OOV , for both OOV regions and in the OOV OOV , as well as for regional OOV .
OOV , we should like to OOV the decision of Parliament and the Commission to OOV out an OOV OOV of the human rights situation in OOV countries .
OOV OOV point is to OOV the OOV need to OOV the OOV for OOV and OOV so that we can OOV a more OOV role , particularly in OOV peace in the OOV OOV .
We consider it particularly important to OOV local measures and OOV development , although this was OOV from the OOV Council OOV , and to OOV out OOV OOV in this area , to OOV major programmes on the environment and OOV , to OOV the OOV programme , and for third countries of the Mediterranean region to take part in the OOV OOV OOV OOV of OOV and OOV development .
The Committee on OOV , OOV OOV , OOV and OOV OOV its OOV opinion on this OOV of OOV .
<SPEAKER OOV OOV " NAME=" OOV > Mr President , OOV a OOV role in the European Union means OOV a OOV of OOV which have OOV far OOV more on OOV than as part of OOV action .
We have already OOV OOV to OOV a OOV OOV with OOV OOV , OOV OOV and the OOV OOV , but we are OOV this too OOV .
It is one of the OOV of Europe , which has the OOV of being the OOV OOV of a OOV system of trade , the market , development , OOV and economic OOV .
This is also necessary in order to OOV the OOV OOV OOV of this last OOV , which are a clear OOV of the OOV of a OOV cooperation policy .
It is OOV from these last two issues that we must start if we OOV want to OOV the Mediterranean area to its OOV OOV and , OOV all , to OOV our OOV role with political OOV .
<P> It is OOV for Europe to be at the OOV in this OOV OOV , OOV the OOV OOV as OOV towards the financial OOV OOV by the OOV and , in particular , by the OOV programme .
At the same time , the OOV of the OOV OOV for OOV and OOV , in which the two OOV of the Mediterranean OOV OOV and the OOV of which OOV from the rights of OOV , of the OOV OOV , of cultural OOV and of OOV OOV , cannot be put OOV any OOV .
In fact , the issue of OOV , which is one of the OOV OOV , must be OOV in respect for cultural and OOV OOV and itself become a means of development .
It cannot be OOV that the European OOV OOV are OOV OOV , but , at the same time , we must put an end to OOV OOV and the OOV OOV OOV of OOV OOV .
OOV to OOV an OOV , OOV OOV OOV all that OOV against OOV or the OOV of democracy can only OOV OOV , OOV and even OOV once again , which would OOV out all the OOV put in and OOV any progress made in OOV OOV far .
<SPEAKER OOV LANGUAGE="SV" NAME=" OOV " > Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , the Swedish Presidency OOV the OOV s Mediterranean cooperation as an important and OOV issue .
I therefore OOV with great interest to Mrs OOV s and Mr OOV ' s OOV of their reports .
<P> It is OOV to OOV that OOV made in both reports OOV to the Swedish Presidency ' s main OOV .
In political terms , the presidency OOV to OOV democracy and human rights , social and economic progress and progress on environmental OOV and , in OOV , OOV and the OOV against various OOV of OOV .
<P> In the economic and financial OOV , we want to work towards an economic and financial OOV which is both OOV and has a human OOV .
The OOV of OOV OOV both economic OOV and social OOV .
OOV OOV , no OOV of trade OOV has been OOV within the OOV OOV , in OOV of the fact that trade and the OOV form one of the three OOV of OOV cooperation .
The presidency is therefore going to OOV a meeting OOV the OOV countries ' trade OOV .
The OOV is to give a OOV OOV to the most important OOV of trade OOV by the OOV OOV and to agree upon the OOV for OOV work .
The need for regional OOV is another important issue which should be OOV .
OOV priority OOV OOV rules of OOV , OOV , OOV measures , OOV and OOV and OOV OOV OOV .
<P> In this OOV , I also wish to point out that the presidency OOV the view that agricultural OOV OOV not to be OOV from the OOV OOV .
It is also important to OOV and support trade and cooperation between the OOV countries themselves .
This is a OOV area in which a great deal must and can be done .
<P> OOV than OOV years have OOV by since the OOV OOV was OOV upon .
A OOV has been OOV , but it has not been possible to OOV many of the OOV .
OOV some OOV , the way OOV OOV in the peace process has OOV the OOV for progress , but other OOV too have had a part to OOV .
We are OOV that a good deal can and should be done to give more OOV to Mediterranean cooperation and to make OOV involved feel that they own more of the process .
I shall therefore be OOV with great interest to today ' s debate , which I am OOV will make a OOV contribution to OOV the OOV s Mediterranean cooperation .
<SPEAKER OOV OOV " NAME=" OOV > Mr President , I would like to start by OOV the two OOV , Mrs OOV and Mr OOV , who have OOV OOV , OOV reports on the future of the Mediterranean policy .
<P> I feel that a OOV needs to be given to the political , cultural and economic OOV of the Mediterranean policy : because we must OOV OOV democracy and the OOV system , because we must OOV the OOV of the OOV of law , because we need to OOV the importance of OOV human rights , because we need cultural OOV OOV OOV OOV of OOV , particularly where OOV OOV are concerned , because we need to OOV OOV , OOV , OOV and OOV OOV and therefore OOV the principle of respect for OOV OOV as part and OOV of OOV and OOV the importance of peace in the OOV OOV of the citizens of the OOV OOV of the Mediterranean , OOV OOV from the cultural process all OOV or OOV OOV and all OOV , which OOV to conflict , OOV and OOV .
<P> OOV , OOV OOV is important for Europe , and it is also important to be able to provide and OOV OOV OOV and OOV financial OOV , and also support and OOV in respect of the OOV of these countries , for , OOV from OOV OOV , the OOV area will then have to become a OOV OOV .
<P> This is what we OOV .
However , I feel that the European Union needs to do an OOV for , in my opinion , the current OOV is to OOV from the OOV OOV and OOV .
The OOV in the OOV programme , for OOV which I see as OOV , and OOV in the OOV OOV are OOV .
OOV of OOV have been OOV not by action but by OOV in action .
We must OOV OOV the OOV that enlargement means a OOV in interest in the Mediterranean .
We call for OOV OOV of the OOV ; we also call for OOV OOV to the Mediterranean peace process between OOV and OOV , and not just between these two OOV but in the OOV area , to OOV the problems of the OOV , OOV , OOV and OOV , so that all this can OOV peace and OOV to that region of the world .
OOV us therefore make our Mediterranean a OOV of peace - for it used to be a OOV of OOV - where OOV , women and citizens can trade and OOV OOV OOV the area .
<SPEAKER OOV OOV " NAME=" OOV > Mr President , I too would like to thank the OOV and point out that this debate has OOV progress in Parliament 's position on the issue of the Mediterranean policy , progress which is extremely important because , OOV from OOV OOV , over and OOV the OOV between political OOV , I can see that we have common OOV on this matter which OOV to our OOV and the OOV of the European OOV .
The Union 's OOV OOV is just as important as its OOV on enlargement to OOV the countries of OOV and OOV Europe , but we have OOV a OOV to OOV for enlargement OOV we are still OOV for a OOV for the Mediterranean policy , even OOV we have the OOV OOV by OOV OOV us and OOV the region 's OOV problems , OOV with the OOV conflict .
I will not OOV on this as the matter will be OOV OOV on when Mr OOV is here .
<P> For now , I just want to say that we call for a more OOV , more OOV role to be OOV by the European OOV , OOV the OOV OOV the OOV to OOV a policy which is not in conflict with or an OOV to the policy of the United States , but is much more OOV than the OOV OOV OOV by Europe with regard to the OOV , OOV OOV , I OOV to say , we cannot do for them .
We must therefore always OOV in OOV that the agreement must be OOV , first and OOV , on OOV and OOV between the OOV and OOV .
<P> On the other hand , we cannot OOV OOV of other areas of conflict such as the OOV OOV .
We must OOV OOV that the United OOV OOV but that , within that framework , there is OOV for a European initiative , and my opinion is that , at the OOV , there is OOV for a European initiative in the OOV OOV issue and that we could put an end to this last OOV OOV .
<P> On the subject of the OOV , I feel that we should OOV the more recent OOV , to which we OOV the Commission and the Council to OOV more importance than we have here today .
I would like to OOV on human rights and the OOV of law .
The OOV of OOV Rights of the European Union OOV a OOV OOV OOV : that is , we OOV that the social and OOV rights of all people are OOV on Union OOV .
This OOV us in a position where we can have OOV with these countries , OOV the question of a OOV OOV where human rights issues are not a question of us OOV in their OOV but of the common need to OOV OOV which are at the basis of the OOV of OOV OOV we want .
OOV , with regard to OOV , I would OOV that it is in both our and their interest to OOV OOV OOV and therefore OOV a OOV policy .
<P> OOV regard to OOV , I would point out to the Swedish Presidency that it is very OOV to say that we are going to open up OOV to OOV trade as well .
You must OOV , gentlemen , that , even now , when they are subject to OOV , our OOV are already OOV with local OOV on the OOV of those countries : OOV us therefore take OOV for OOV could OOV a sector which is of OOV importance for some countries .
OOV OOV OOV OOV us that OOV means OOV people in the OOV , OOV employment and OOV the environment .
OOV us therefore OOV OOV and OOV OOV in OOV OOV on OOV where we need to progress in a OOV which does not OOV these countries .
<SPEAKER OOV LANGUAGE="ES " NAME=" OOV " > Mr President , I would OOV like to OOV our OOV for the work OOV out by Mrs OOV and Mr OOV and for their OOV to our proposals , and I would also like to say that our group OOV both reports .
<P> OOV OOV , I would like to OOV some positive OOV which have been OOV , particularly in the field of human rights , and more especially an OOV from our group which OOV for OOV of the OOV OOV and a OOV on OOV OOV .
It would be OOV for great hope if the OOV were to take OOV OOV .
<P> On a different issue , I would also like to OOV our OOV in the OOV that the amendments provide in the regional and local field and to civil society , especially to OOV OOV as a OOV OOV OOV for development , over and OOV state aid and European aid at the OOV level .
<P> I will not go into any more OOV , because I believe that the main points have been made clear by Mrs OOV and Mr OOV in their OOV .
However , I would like to make two OOV in OOV to the OOV which we have OOV in committee and in our group .
OOV of these concerns political OOV and the other concerns the OOV of our OOV .
<P> We do not all believe that we have to set the priority of enlargement towards the OOV against the priority of the Mediterranean .
I also believe that the OOV of the Council , Mrs OOV , made this clear the other OOV in committee .
They are two real OOV but they are different .
OOV is an OOV priority for which we have set OOV , we know where we are going and we know what we want and , in OOV , there are no OOV OOV OOV .
<P> On the other hand , Mediterranean policy is a OOV priority , in which we do not know where we are going or , to be more OOV , we are OOV OOV towards a place to which we do not want to go .
The OOV change in OOV , OOV in OOV current OOV and economic OOV , OOV that our OOV OOV OOV OOV will OOV and the OOV OOV OOV OOV in OOV OOV will OOV and , OOV this is OOV , the problems we all OOV , and which there is no need to OOV , will increase .
We know what will OOV , but we do not know how to OOV it , although we want to OOV it at all costs .
OOV us not , therefore , set political OOV against one another .
<P> OOV other point concerns the OOV of our OOV , because , in order to get results , we must be more OOV .
OOV , we need will and we need resources , but , in fact , resources are not being used ; and this means that there is OOV OOV for management on our part , and there is OOV OOV for OOV on the part of the OOV countries .
OOV is OOV and then is not used .
OOV , OOV should ask OOV do we not OOV the OOV ? '
But what we really need is a OOV and it must be used .
For all these OOV I believe that we need OOV as well as the OOV for OOV .
<P> I hope that these reports will help us to find the OOV OOV , but quite OOV I am not OOV they will .
<SPEAKER OOV LANGUAGE="ES " NAME=" OOV OOV " > Mr President , I am going to OOV on an OOV of the common OOV for the Mediterranean region which is not being taken into account in all OOV : the OOV OOV , which is an important OOV OOV within the OOV for relations between the European Union and the OOV countries .
The OOV of OOV authorities and OOV which OOV OOV the most OOV problems is OOV .
The management of OOV on specific points and on common OOV is a need which has become a real one in OOV to OOV in which , on a OOV level , citizens and OOV from both OOV of the OOV of OOV have been OOV with OOV results and without Community OOV .
<P> For the OOV of this local management , it would be necessary to OOV a new OOV which , as a OOV and OOV OOV , would OOV together all the OOV , political and social OOV of these OOV which are so OOV and yet so far OOV .
The OOV OOV which OOV the European Union from the OOV are real , but OOV us ensure that this does not become an OOV OOV which OOV the OOV possible cooperation .
OOV , its OOV and OOV - which are OOV OOV and OOV - OOV , agricultural and fishing OOV , social , OOV , OOV and OOV OOV , OOV of common development , such as those in the energy sector , and the OOV OOV political OOV which the European Union must OOV in those countries all OOV the OOV of new OOV and OOV which , in a OOV OOV , would OOV to these needs , which are local but which have OOV OOV .
<SPEAKER OOV LANGUAGE="FR" NAME=" OOV " > Mr President , although the OOV OOV OOV OOV and OOV , today we must OOV OOV .
What OOV were OOV OOV , such as OOV for an area of OOV OOV , for a OOV of OOV and OOV , a OOV to OOV peace and OOV , are now OOV issues .
OOV we all see the need to OOV the OOV , there is , however , a OOV in the OOV we favour .
The future of the very OOV of a OOV OOV not in OOV the needs of these OOV to the market OOV at work in the OOV and to our OOV OOV , but OOV in OOV their own development and OOV their OOV issues .
I believe , therefore , that Europe should OOV some approach other than OOV OOV these countries in OOV the OOV area that Europe was to set up .
OOV cooperation OOV , particularly through public services , OOV other financial resources , by OOV a OOV OOV , for example , and OOV or even OOV OOV OOV would give real OOV to a OOV and OOV OOV .
This approach would favour OOV relations without the OOV of OOV .
The same OOV to human rights .
OOV OOV with countries in the Mediterranean region can only be OOV on OOV .
We are , therefore , extremely concerned about human rights OOV in OOV , for example , because the OOV OOV by both parties OOV them to respect human rights .
The same OOV to the European Union ' s respect for the rights of all citizens .
I am OOV here of the need for a more OOV and more OOV approach to OOV .
It is OOV and OOV to OOV the OOV OOV of OOV and OOV but not of people .
OOV OOV that OOV OOV OOV only to OOV OOV with no OOV OOV and no rights into the OOV of OOV and other OOV OOV .
<P> OOV can we OOV of OOV OOV in a more OOV OOV , how can we hope and OOV for further OOV , if we do not question its OOV ?
We must OOV the OOV of OOV of OOV and OOV in social , economic , cultural and political rights .
<P> OOV OOV up , in order to OOV an area of peace in the OOV OOV , the European Union needs to take much more OOV and OOV action .
OOV now on , the United OOV OOV must be OOV in full , OOV must respect its OOV and we must OOV the OOV ' OOV right to their own state .
The same problem - I am about to OOV - can be OOV in the OOV OOV , where there is a OOV that OOV conflict will be OOV .
<P> OOV all this , the European Union has OOV to OOV by OOV together all parties , such as OOV , local authorities and OOV , who are already OOV a different form of OOV .
<SPEAKER OOV LANGUAGE="FR" NAME=" OOV " > Mr President , Mrs OOV s report on Mediterranean policy , or what OOV to be a report on this subject , OOV out , first of all , for one OOV reason but one that is always OOV in this OOV .
At long last , it OOV the problem of common OOV policy back in its OOV OOV , by which I OOV the OOV OOV , OOV OOV . OOV OOV , the OOV of OOV and OOV , the OOV of OOV in terms of their own areas of OOV , their own OOV and their own OOV of interests , even if these are OOV OOV from those of the OOV Europe , a OOV so OOV that it does not have any real OOV .
<P> So this report OOV OOV policy back into OOV .
As I mentioned , OOV position is the OOV or OOV , if you OOV , or , in other words , the OOV which OOV us to OOV , OOV and OOV respect the OOV political OOV that are OOV by OOV .
This OOV , OOV , just how OOV , if not , as we might more OOV say , OOV , it is to OOV a common OOV policy through OOV OOV such as OOV .
OOV , the way that political Europe OOV OOV OOV rules out the OOV approach since , as there is no OOV of what OOV Europe ' s common interest - by which I OOV a European OOV OOV - it still OOV , after all the OOV OOV , the law of the OOV , OOV the OOV at any given time to make the OOV of the OOV support its OOV OOV , even if it has to OOV them down their OOV .
We therefore come to OOV that , in this OOV , the OOV hand on Mediterranean policy , as well as on many other OOV , is OOV by OOV Europe - OOV OOV .
OOV OOV OOV OOV and its OOV OOV .
That is why priority has clearly been given to enlargement to the OOV and to the OOV including the OOV , where we are OOV the OOV of OOV policy , OOV our OOV in the Mediterranean region OOV the costs of every OOV .
<P> OOV , the rapporteur and my good OOV , Mr OOV , are both OOV in OOV Europe ' s OOV of OOV to the Mediterranean region and OOV OOV OOV .
I would just like to OOV that all the OOV countries may OOV or OOV OOV , OOV even OOV OOV the OOV of a future which OOV them to the OOV of a group over which they no OOV have any OOV .
OOV today , we believe that it is the OOV of the OOV European OOV , or rather the OOV Mediterranean OOV , to work together with the OOV Mediterranean countries , OOV , the three OOV countries , OOV , OOV and OOV , to OOV this area of OOV , which is a part of our OOV and OOV and that is , OOV , of importance to us in the OOV that is just OOV .
<SPEAKER OOV OOV " NAME=" OOV " > Mr President , the two reports which we are OOV today have at least one OOV in common : they OOV a whole OOV of OOV OOV and OOV with regard to the Mediterranean region .
OOV , we OOV OOV the resources to do an OOV OOV and what is more , the European Union ' s OOV relations have been such that we cannot OOV to be OOV OOV .
It is high time we OOV OOV , OOV OOV us to do the things we do OOV the Union well .
<P> OOV OOV made by Mr OOV OOV the need to OOV .
OOV OOV to the Union ' s OOV OOV , including those with regard to the Mediterranean countries , as OOV OOV OOV .
OOV on OOV OOV OOV OOV into OOV in OOV .
However , the OOV OOV and OOV in the OOV before us do OOV OOV OOV our OOV , OOV which we cannot OOV OOV , because we also have other OOV .
<P> OOV reports are OOV about those other OOV .
OOV to the OOV , our OOV with OOV countries , in particular , has OOV to the OOV of the OOV countries , and that must now be put right .
However , I do not agree with this OOV of OOV .
OOV OOV all our attention in the OOV future .
If we want to do this OOV , we will have our OOV full .
There is therefore certainly no OOV of OOV as much OOV on our OOV OOV , certainly not if we OOV in OOV how OOV Member States are to put more OOV into the Union ' s OOV .
<P> OOV , both reports take an OOV view of the Union ' s OOV in the political OOV .
We should not be under any OOV , particularly when it OOV to the role which the European Union could OOV in the OOV peace process .
I OOV that both reports OOV the OOV of not being taken OOV OOV to OOV OOV .
OOV , the European Union could very well be of OOV , especially in the economic OOV , but also when it OOV to the problem of OOV .
We should only concern OOV with OOV where the European Union can provide OOV OOV and can really be of OOV .
OOV OOV as to in our OOV will OOV the quality of the European Union ' s OOV relations .
<SPEAKER OOV LANGUAGE="DE " NAME=" OOV " > Mr President , as the OOV of a country that once had OOV OOV to the Mediterranean , I would like to OOV my OOV support for OOV better relations between the EU and the Mediterranean region , and OOV , for this report .
It is not just a political , but also a OOV OOV we must make .
OOV to say , the OOV s OOV with regard to OOV peace in the Mediterranean , especially in OOV to the OOV of conflict in the OOV OOV , OOV a OOV responsibility , which , OOV , the OOV and OOV of the European Union , and particularly their OOV policy OOV , have been OOV to in the OOV .
However , the OOV of an OOV and OOV European peace policy must OOV one of the OOV s OOV .
<P> That said , there are also other OOV OOV the security OOV , as to why it is important for the EU to OOV a more OOV role in the Mediterranean region .
The EU cannot , OOV should it , OOV any OOV in the social and cultural OOV , in OOV OOV OOV , in OOV in the OOV of human rights OOV , in OOV economic development , and in OOV OOV and cooperation in as many areas as possible , if it OOV to see OOV progress .
If we are to OOV all these proposals , as OOV in the report , OOV no more than OOV of OOV , we will need to work on the OOV of OOV , which has also been OOV for in this House , and which OOV out in OOV terms the order in which these OOV are to be OOV out and the OOV OOV .
OOV , my OOV was not one of OOV when I mentioned our OOV OOV to the Mediterranean .
<SPEAKER OOV LANGUAGE="ES " NAME=" OOV OOV " > Mr President , as we can OOV from the OOV by the OOV , and at this OOV it is OOV necessary to OOV it , the Mediterranean region must be one of the European Union ' s OOV OOV , because the problems of the OOV Mediterranean - the political OOV , the economic OOV , the OOV OOV - OOV us , OOV or OOV , as OOV .
OOV of this are the OOV OOV in our OOV , the OOV of our environment and the OOV OOV to our society by OOV OOV .
In OOV , OOV on our OOV OOV is OOV to our OOV .
<P> It is therefore important that we OOV the view that the Union ' s OOV OOV for enlargement towards OOV and OOV Europe must not OOV to a OOV of its policy towards the Mediterranean .
OOV , OOV in OOV my group OOV and OOV OOV the open process in OOV which , at last , after OOV OOV years , OOV up a OOV OOV for the Community countries in OOV to the Mediterranean countries , it now OOV the OOV OOV in the reports which we are OOV today to OOV the OOV OOV .
<P> In particular , in OOV to Mr OOV ' s report , we have OOV to improve it in committee by means of various OOV and I would like to thank the rapporteur for being OOV towards them .
We have OOV on the importance of OOV OOV OOV , which must be OOV as one of the OOV OOV in OOV the OOV OOV .
We would like to point out that we should OOV the OOV of the economic systems of our Mediterranean OOV and OOV out the OOV OOV necessary to OOV in more open OOV .
We have OOV the OOV of a OOV OOV for OOV OOV , responsible OOV other things for OOV OOV to OOV , in a OOV OOV , the OOV which OOV from OOV OOV .
We would like to point out that relations between the European Union and the Mediterranean countries are OOV on a OOV OOV , one of the OOV of which is OOV fishing , and therefore we OOV that the OOV Government will OOV an OOV which OOV the current OOV in the negotiations which are taking place .
<P> Finally we would like to point out to the Commission that , within the framework of the OOV taking place in its OOV OOV , the human resources OOV to the Mediterranean OOV need to be OOV , a specific OOV needs to be OOV in the Commission , and progress needs to be made on the OOV and OOV of aid .
In OOV , my group is in favour of the European Union OOV a OOV role in the Mediterranean and we hope that human and OOV resources are OOV that are a OOV for the OOV OOV us .
<SPEAKER OOV LANGUAGE="ES " NAME=" OOV OOV OOV " > Mr President , the OOV that the Mediterranean is the number one priority of European Union OOV policy OOV from the OOV that , although the Mediterranean is no OOV the OOV of the world , each and every one of the great OOV and OOV of the OOV OOV are OOV there .
The Mediterranean OOV a OOV example of the issue of OOV and peace .
The issue of OOV relations is OOV OOV in the Mediterranean .
The very OOV issue of the OOV of OOV or OOV between OOV is OOV by the Mediterranean .
The OOV of OOV and OOV , or OOV and OOV , is most OOV OOV in the Mediterranean .
The question of democracy and human rights or OOV is OOV in the Mediterranean and will continue to be so in the OOV years .
The issue of regional OOV to the OOV of OOV is being OOV in the Mediterranean .
The issue of women ' s OOV or OOV is also at its most OOV in the Mediterranean region .
<P> There is no need to OOV therefore that this is our OOV priority , because the OOV for its future OOV OOV open , OOV enlargement will take time , it will have its costs and its problems , but the only OOV OOV that OOV can OOV is that it will OOV take place .
<P> In the Mediterranean , a OOV ' or a OOV ' may be OOV in the OOV OOV , and both issues are OOV OOV .
The two OOV OOV here today , in the European Parliament , are OOV to the OOV of the OOV policy .
I believe that Mr OOV and Mr OOV would do very well to OOV these reports , and in particular , the report by my OOV and OOV , OOV OOV , because it OOV a very OOV and well put together OOV of OOV , which OOV for a political proposal .
<P> This policy was well OOV in OOV OOV years OOV but today it needs not only a new OOV of will but also the OOV to OOV OOV .
We must achieve - OOV all in the Mediterranean , and we OOV know this - something very important : things need to be OOV .
OOV , if OOV is OOV today , it is OOV specific action , a OOV OOV that the Union , the Council , the Commission and Parliament , are OOV OOV in this OOV , which OOV OOV words and OOV .
<P> In this regard , I would like to OOV attention to an OOV of OOV OOV ' s report : the need to OOV OOV OOV in the OOV of OOV trade and for OOV OOV or OOV in the OOV Mediterranean region .
We need something OOV .
I do not know OOV what it may be , but it must OOV OOV over public opinion in the OOV so that people can see that the European Union clearly has , as well as a well OOV policy , the will to OOV OOV and financial OOV , OOV that OOV to OOV OOV in the OOV or OOV of OOV and OOV .
This OOV must make a OOV contribution to this OOV of the will for OOV which , OOV all in the OOV , is a OOV for hope at the OOV and which must OOV on an OOV and also OOV contribution from the Union .
<SPEAKER OOV OOV " NAME=" OOV > Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I certainly OOV the OOV taken by Mrs OOV and Mr OOV 's reports , and their OOV , but there is a need to OOV on certain OOV which are not OOV with .
It is important to start from this OOV : the European Union 's OOV for the Mediterranean , OOV at OOV , in OOV to OOV to provide OOV OOV , does not take into account certain OOV which have taken place in recent years in the Mediterranean OOV .
OOV OOV of OOV and OOV it has OOV a OOV position in world trade again , which , after the OOV of OOV , had been OOV by the OOV OOV .
OOV also to the new OOV OOV in OOV , Europe now OOV more with OOV than with OOV .
For these trade OOV between OOV and OOV , the Mediterranean OOV a OOV OOV for OOV OOV for OOV Europe , which means that OOV do not have to make OOV .
This is OOV a new development which the European Union cannot OOV and which has already OOV the first , OOV results .
OOV it is towards this OOV , OOV system that we must OOV to OOV our funds , a system which is already OOV with transport OOV in the form of OOV , OOV and OOV .
OOV this OOV OOV , the funds will OOV not be OOV , as is the case at present .
<SPEAKER OOV LANGUAGE="FR" OOV " > Mr President , I believe that the great OOV of these reports is that they OOV down the OOV of the Commission ' s OOV OOV what it OOV the progress made since OOV , and that they open the way to OOV and OOV OOV for the OOV to take .
<P> What were the OOV of that OOV ?
They are , once again , the OOV of an area of peace , the OOV of OOV OOV OOV the OOV of the region and the OOV of an area of OOV OOV .
The first two OOV have not been OOV , as Mr OOV has said .
OOV , this is OOV .
We have not OOV an area of OOV OOV OOV , only the very OOV of a OOV area OOV some of the countries , OOV on European terms , because the main OOV of these are the OOV OOV in which we have a OOV OOV .
<P> I am OOV OOV , OOV , that those who are the OOV to call for an OOV of a OOV area , OOV the OOV OOV on terms that are extremely OOV for the countries of the OOV , are also the first to OOV of OOV , even OOV , with regard to human rights issues .
<P> In OOV , the OOV contribution of civil society to the development of OOV was OOV for the first time in a OOV to which the European Union and OOV countries of the OOV Mediterranean OOV .
We must OOV that we have OOV OOV on this issue .
We have been OOV to support the OOV efforts of citizens and OOV OOV , in the OOV of the OOV OOV adopted by most OOV , but is this from OOV of any real will to do so ?
OOV can we use the OOV OOV and the OOV programme to support them ?
What OOV of OOV OOV and what set of OOV measures can we OOV in order to OOV this OOV situation where what we say and what we do are two quite different things ?
OOV we really wish to OOV the OOV OOV , or would we rather OOV OOV to the Europe of the OOV s OOV to OOV relations in the same OOV OOV as some OOV OOV ' OOV ?
<SPEAKER OOV OOV NAME=" OOV " > Mr President , the European Union 's policy towards the countries of the Mediterranean is a far OOV from the OOV OOV and an even OOV OOV from the real needs of the people in these countries .
As Mr OOV OOV said , the European Union only OOV to be OOV in the Mediterranean for OOV of security and only OOV OOV in order to OOV a OOV on the OOV in the OOV countries .
The new common OOV OOV even further in the same OOV ; it even OOV to OOV the Mediterranean countries in the OOV OOV
OOV OOV is the main OOV for OOV in the OOV OOV of the Mediterranean countries , and , OOV , all this is being done in the OOV of common OOV , democracy , the OOV of law and human rights .
<P> At the same time , the European Union OOV OOV OOV to the OOV of the Palestinian people and the OOV of OOV by the state of OOV on a OOV basis .
The OOV OOV of OOV OOV OOV between people on OOV terms and without one country 's OOV in the OOV OOV of another .
In particular , we would point out that it is the OOV OOV countries which are responsible for the current state of the OOV countries .
That is yet another reason why the OOV countries are OOV OOV to help these countries OOV their OOV OOV and OOV the OOV of OOV of their OOV .
<SPEAKER OOV OOV " NAME=" OOV > Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I certainly OOV OOV Mr OOV 's report , which does not OOV any OOV but OOV an OOV OOV of a problem which needs to be OOV , first and OOV at political level , and also Mrs OOV 's report , which is OOV and OOV just as OOV a OOV .
It is , of course , no OOV necessary to OOV the House of the role , the OOV and the importance of the Mediterranean in the very OOV of European OOV and the way that it is both the OOV and the OOV of our OOV .
<P> However , we cannot OOV the fact that , OOV far , our OOV action in this major OOV area has not been OOV and has certainly not been OOV .
OOV OOV programmes , OOV , even a certain OOV of clear OOV and political OOV have OOV us from making what is - I am OOV - the will of our OOV a OOV OOV , that is from OOV the three OOV OOV on at OOV : an area of peace and OOV , an area of OOV OOV through OOV trade and greater OOV between OOV .
<P> As a Member of the Committee on OOV , I can only hope that the Commission will be OOV to change the way it OOV the OOV programme and the very OOV of the programme , in the OOV OOV by Mr OOV , that is , OOV its approach on OOV OOV of the OOV of OOV , greater OOV to OOV support , and less OOV OOV .
The Commission , which is already OOV the OOV OOV OOV , also needs to OOV to be more OOV by OOV an OOV OOV OOV the OOV OOV which can be made for each country .
This is an area we must OOV if we OOV want to OOV our policy .
<SPEAKER OOV LANGUAGE="DE " OOV " > Mr President , the OOV OOV is a OOV OOV , only OOV OOV it is 2000 years OOV .
A system OOV on OOV with the same rights and OOV is OOV to OOV from a OOV and a OOV system .
OOV from a OOV OOV , the OOV OOV were always OOV in such a way as to OOV a OOV OOV , and now it is only right that Europe , OOV countries - or rather , certain European States from within this system - were OOV always the OOV , should also take responsibility for OOV and OOV , and should OOV these OOV too .
<P> The OOV of the OOV OOV is OOV .
OOV OOV OOV not only on OOV OOV OOV , but also on the OOV to which we are able to OOV the OOV we OOV OOV towards the Mediterranean States and their OOV .
There can be no OOV that the OOV of the OOV OOV will OOV OOV to a peace OOV of the OOV OOV .
<P> OOV , it is important to ensure that no Mediterranean country is OOV .
OOV , the country that OOV OOV OOV at the OOV of the Mediterranean States , OOV OOV in the OOV OOV .
The process of OOV will not work OOV the EU OOV to OOV OOV to take part in it .
<SPEAKER OOV LANGUAGE="ES " NAME=" OOV OOV " > Mr President , Commissioner , we are all OOV with the OOV of problems OOV the OOV region and their OOV : they are OOV the same as in OOV when the OOV OOV was OOV .
They have already been mentioned in the debate : from OOV OOV to OOV , from OOV OOV to the OOV to respect human rights , and OOV , which OOV OOV the OOV of OOV human OOV and OOV , as we are OOV in OOV , in OOV and in the OOV OOV itself .
<P> OOV more than OOV we must make the OOV that only cooperation , OOV , economic and cultural OOV , OOV and OOV OOV can OOV the two OOV of the Mediterranean into a OOV and OOV area .
OOV the European Union OOV the OOV or OOV countries can OOV not to take OOV of the human and cultural resources that OOV the region .
The problem is that we are not OOV that OOV .
The OOV OOV are OOV OOV in many OOV .
The financial OOV are not being used as they should and the political , economic and social development of those countries is not OOV up with the OOV of OOV cooperation , which is very necessary , OOV with the OOV OOV today by a world which , OOV OOV , is taking OOV OOV forward .
<P> It is time to OOV from OOV to action , to OOV OOV and OOV in the efforts to OOV the OOV which has been OOV up and , in this respect , I would like to OOV the OOV for human resources to be OOV , as OOV by Mr OOV .
<SPEAKER OOV OOV NAME=" OOV " > Mr President , today we are OOV two reports which are political reports OOV OOV and with which I fully OOV .
That being the case , OOV of OOV on these two reports , I should like to say a few words to OOV the OOV OOV them .
<P> A few OOV OOV , we had a OOV debate because the President of the Commission , Mr OOV , said that European OOV OOV from the time of OOV .
The very OOV Europe which , as OOV , we all OOV , OOV from the OOV OOV , the OOV of OOV and OOV , the OOV of the OOV .
OOV was OOV 's OOV , the OOV of OOV , OOV and OOV .
OOV am I OOV you all this ?
OOV OOV itself , which is a OOV OOV of OOV , OOV the relations which OOV between Europe and OOV OOV .
The Mediterranean is , to all OOV and OOV , the only European OOV , and as long as we , in our OOV and OOV , look down on the other OOV of the Mediterranean from on high , then we shall get OOV .
We need to get a few things OOV .
If , in the OOV OOV , we OOV and OOV OOV on the OOV by certain European countries to find OOV of the recent OOV to OOV on then , OOV , Europe will get OOV .
We must OOV that the OOV point for today 's debate , OOV on the two reports , OOV on the decisions taken in OOV , is to see the other OOV of the Mediterranean as part of Europe .
<P> The European Union itself must take OOV - development , cultural and , most OOV , peace OOV - so that the two OOV of Europe can OOV OOV each other without our again OOV OOV of " OOV OOV OOV " or " OOV OOV OOV " or a OOV OOV of OOV .
There are OOV on the other OOV of the Mediterranean and we would do well to OOV that .
<SPEAKER OOV OOV " OOV OOV OOV " > Mr President , the OOV OOV was not OOV in good OOV or financial resources .
OOV this , the OOV was OOV , which is very OOV .
There was too much OOV OOV going on and too OOV OOV to OOV out the OOV .
OOV OOV of the OOV OOV OOV OOV the OOV .
OOV of a OOV in the means , this will now OOV to an increase , which is a OOV OOV , to say the least .
It OOV no OOV to OOV for even OOV OOV if the OOV OOV OOV OOV and the Commission OOV are OOV .
<P> It would be far more OOV if the European Union were to OOV its OOV with the Mediterranean countries by OOV up its OOV more , not only for OOV from industry , but also for those from OOV and OOV .
We have a very long way to go before a OOV area is OOV .
<P> The OOV of the OOV countries are still very OOV .
OOV OOV trade is still being OOV and has OOV OOV all over it .
OOV , the political OOV which OOV between the OOV must first be OOV .
<P> The OOV OOV can only OOV if the Mediterranean OOV continue to work on OOV .
The human rights OOV in the OOV OOV should not OOV OOV OOV .
OOV OOV should be OOV by a OOV in financial support .
But if we OOV the OOV which cannot be OOV OOV , then this will not make any OOV OOV .
We must OOV our OOV into OOV with the OOV to which they can be OOV .
<P> The question is whether the report ' s many OOV OOV can all be OOV at the same time .
It is better to do one OOV which is OOV OOV than to do a great deal of things which are OOV OOV .
OOV words and OOV OOV are not enough to OOV OOV and OOV .
It is about the OOV to OOV out OOV political OOV , and this is what the OOV OOV still OOV .
<SPEAKER OOV NAME=" OOV " > Mr President , the Mediterranean is the OOV of European OOV .
The OOV of OOV OOV , OOV and OOV OOV our OOV , our OOV , our very OOV of the common European heritage .
OOV the Mediterranean the three OOV OOV - OOV , OOV , OOV - were OOV and OOV and OOV OOV the OOV world .
OOV OOV to the Mediterranean is not only OOV and cultural , it OOV our common interest today in enlargement .
It is OOV that OOV OOV countries from OOV and OOV Europe , but the OOV countries OOV the two OOV Mediterranean OOV OOV : the OOV and the OOV .
<P> I very much hope that the Mediterranean programme and the enlargement process may be OOV as OOV and not OOV .
It is OOV that today the presidency should be OOV by Mr OOV from OOV Europe .
OOV example of OOV OOV was when OOV OOV OOV OOV the OOV OOV OOV the OOV of the OOV OOV .
I hope that OOV relations between the EU and OOV OOV may result from the Mediterranean programme .
OOV we OOV for the OOV of the OOV OOV from a OOV OOV in the OOV , but I OOV it is the OOV of the OOV to OOV , in future , better OOV and other relations with , for example , OOV .
<P> I have a question for the Council .
OOV Mr OOV OOV that the OOV s Mediterranean programme is OOV with the enlargement process to which the presidency OOV so much importance ?
I OOV if it might be possible for the Commissioner in his OOV to OOV on the OOV of OOV OOV OOV at the OOV programme .
OOV it the case that the Commission OOV OOV when necessary to give OOV support in the OOV of OOV programmes , as they did in the OOV when I OOV a report on the OOV and OOV areas of OOV ?
OOV it the case that , if there were to be OOV , the OOV could be OOV ?
<P> Finally , OOV OOV OOV of the OOV report , could the Commissioner also OOV that the two Mediterranean OOV countries might be able to OOV in the OOV OOV programme .
<SPEAKER OOV LANGUAGE="FR" NAME=" OOV > Commissioner , last OOV , you OOV said in the OOV OOV that the OOV of the OOV OOV was both OOV and OOV , OOV OOV . an area at peace , OOV OOV OOV , OOV the OOV of civil society OOV OOV human rights and OOV the OOV OOV of different OOV .
These three points should OOV us in our relations with our Mediterranean OOV .
It was in this OOV that the Group of the OOV of European OOV OOV with the OOV , Mrs OOV and our OOV , Mr OOV .
For we must now set OOV that have OOV OOV OOV and we must OOV OOV resources to OOV them .
We know that these OOV are , first of all , to make progress OOV the difficult road that is the OOV for OOV and OOV .
The OOV Presidency OOV to do this against an extremely OOV OOV and the Swedish Presidency , I am OOV , will continue OOV this OOV .
We would hope so and we shall all OOV an OOV on this .
<P> The OOV OOV should not be OOV OOV to the OOV OOV peace process .
OOV the OOV ; the OOV OOV and the state of OOV between the OOV and Palestinian people OOV only to OOV the current need to improve OOV between the countries OOV the Mediterranean .
<P> We should also OOV up the OOV , OOV and implementation of the OOV OOV , since this OOV OOV the OOV of both parties and OOV an OOV OOV .
We are OOV to OOV that an agreement has just been OOV with OOV .
<P> OOV , we cannot continue OOV just one OOV in the OOV for every OOV we OOV in the OOV .
This OOV OOV more OOV with every OOV OOV .
OOV , of course , we must OOV the OOV of the OOV financial OOV to a OOV OOV so as to improve the quality and OOV of its implementation .
<P> Finally , we call for OOV cooperation to be OOV on new OOV , so that we can OOV the OOV and OOV to the OOV of OOV from civil society , both European and Mediterranean , because the OOV will be OOV OOV if it is not a OOV of OOV .
<P> OOV , I was OOV to OOV that the Swedish Presidency OOV to OOV on the cultural , social and human OOV of the Mediterranean OOV .
<P> Commissioner , our OOV with the OOV needs the OOV of more than just words and political OOV .
OOV OOV are OOV OOV OOV to be taken , as Mr OOV OOV in his report , which I OOV was particularly OOV .
<SPEAKER OOV OOV " NAME=" OOV , OOV > Mr President , only a year OOV , the OOV enlargement policy was OOV to be a possible OOV of development for Europe .
OOV , it is OOV a OOV part of European policy .
I hope that the same will become OOV of Mediterranean policy as of today , not only because the OOV OOV is one of the most OOV areas on our OOV or because the OOV OOV of the Mediterranean is the OOV OOV of OOV towards Europe , but also , I am OOV to say , because , as President OOV OOV OOV , having already OOV OOV we have now OOV OOV , and the Mediterranean has OOV its OOV position in world trade and OOV which must be OOV on both OOV and OOV OOV .
<P> In my opinion , if this is OOV the OOV of the OOV programme cannot be taken as the OOV , although I am OOV that OOV OOV of its results would OOV a different OOV on things , but there are three OOV to be OOV : OOV , OOV OOV OOV through OOV cooperation , which can be OOV OOV ; OOV , a OOV programme for the OOV OOV of the Mediterranean , which Europe must OOV in order to OOV itself a better future ; OOV , OOV OOV OOV transport OOV in the Mediterranean , which will become a OOV point OOV of OOV or of major development for both OOV and OOV OOV of the OOV .
<SPEAKER OOV LANGUAGE="FR" NAME=" OOV , OOV " > Mr President , we all OOV , both today and OOV , the importance that we OOV to Mediterranean policy and to the need to OOV OOV the OOV OOV , which is all too often OOV .
The OOV year has not OOV up to these OOV .
OOV , it was possible to OOV another OOV OOV during the OOV Presidency , but this meeting OOV few decisions and , OOV all , no OOV OOV .
OOV , I believe that it is time to give our Mediterranean OOV a OOV OOV and to OOV it from the OOV of the OOV conflict .
<P> I OOV hope that the European Union will achieve its OOV of OOV economic , political and cultural OOV with the countries of the Mediterranean OOV .
<P> We shall OOV be OOV the OOV agreement between the European Union and OOV .
I am OOV that this agreement was OOV OOV last OOV .
As the rapporteur on OOV , I OOV hope that we can take this opportunity to OOV the other OOV who have not yet OOV up to an agreement to do so as OOV as possible .
<P> It is also OOV OOV the European Parliament ' s role in this process , which is still too OOV .
OOV OOV we might be able to OOV the OOV OOV OOV on the OOV of the OOV OOV OOV , which OOV OOV OOV and can set up working parties and OOV OOV OOV .
We could also , OOV , improve the OOV of Parliament ' s OOV OOV in OOV OOV between the OOV OOV OOV .
<P> OOV OOV up , Mr President , I would like to ask the Council and the Commission to OOV OOV the role of OOV and OOV OOV , and I should like to thank Mr OOV , the rapporteur , for OOV to OOV an OOV that I made to his excellent report .
The Mediterranean countries should be OOV to OOV their relations and to OOV their OOV on specific OOV issues .
The problems of OOV OOV are most serious within OOV and OOV OOV . <SPEAKER OOV OOV " NAME=" OOV > Mr President , this OOV debate is OOV issues which will OOV be at the OOV of the OOV OOV OOV .
We are all OOV that the future of the Union 's Mediterranean OOV OOV OOV on the OOV of the OOV OOV peace policy , which we must be more OOV in OOV even OOV it is the United States which is at the OOV of this political initiative .
The OOV of the OOV OOV and the OOV results of economic cooperation between the European Union and the countries of the area should OOV the peace policy .
<P> OOV , OOV enlargement , which OOV OOV OOV from the OOV OOV , must go hand in hand with an OOV OOV OOV for the Mediterranean OOV , which has to OOV .
<P> OOV OOV , including financial support , is therefore OOV for the OOV OOV and the OOV programmes , particularly the programmes OOV OOV OOV , OOV OOV , OOV OOV cooperation with the Union 's OOV OOV and OOV OOV , and especially with the OOV and regions of Mediterranean Europe .
<P> OOV and social progress must also OOV to the OOV of the areas of democracy , but , as has already been OOV , we must not OOV OOV of the fact that full respect for human rights is OOV if the OOV is OOV to OOV .
<SPEAKER OOV LANGUAGE="ES " OOV OOV OOV " > Mr President , I would OOV like to OOV the OOV , Mrs OOV and Mr OOV , on the excellent work they have done on an issue as OOV as the conflict in this part of the world .
<P> I would also like to start my OOV by OOV Parliament - I believe this is good OOV - about the OOV programme , with which OOV some of you are already OOV .
On OOV OOV the Council OOV a OOV contribution in this regard , which OOV an increase of OOV % on the OOV OOV for the OOV programme .
This means that , OOV to the EUR OOV million used during the OOV OOV , that OOV contribution will now OOV EUR OOV million OOV year .
I believe that this OOV the OOV that OOV relations between Parliament , the Commission and the Council in this field .
<P> On the other hand - and OOV - we must OOV , however , that OOV means are not being made available to find an appropriate OOV for this aid , since , in the OOV OOV , OOV OOV % of the OOV aid was not OOV .
This is OOV management .
I do not know what the problem is , but there is a problem .
<P> OOV , I would like to OOV to the social , cultural and human OOV of these OOV OOV OOV countries , to which our various OOV must OOV OOV , and with OOV we must OOV OOV and improve OOV OOV .
It also OOV a OOV OOV in terms of the OOV and OOV of young people , which must be OOV on OOV , since young people are the future of these OOV .
OOV must we OOV OOV , as well as the OOV of OOV rights .
<P> Finally , I would like to say one OOV : we have an OOV to do this well , because if we do not do it out of OOV , we will have to do it out of OOV , because what is at OOV is the security of OOV Europe .
<SPEAKER OOV NAME=" OOV " > Mr President , it is very appropriate that we are OOV these two very good reports only a few OOV before the OOV OOV , which is OOV to OOV next OOV .
OOV OOV have mentioned the importance of that OOV , which must be OOV over the OOV years if we are to get the OOV OOV back on OOV and OOV .
<P> I would like to OOV OOV on the OOV for the OOV programme , for OOV , and say I am OOV at the very OOV OOV .
The report OOV that is OOV to OOV OOV and OOV within the Commission .
A OOV OOV of OOV , Mr OOV , is OOV his best to make OOV that we do get OOV in the right OOV of areas - OOV , OOV , and to OOV the needs of the various countries .
<P> I am first OOV of the OOV for OOV .
They are not OOV to OOV for as much work as they want .
We need more OOV in the OOV that is agreed upon .
We need to know where the OOV is going and - very OOV indeed - we need a better OOV OOV of where the OOV has OOV because a OOV of OOV in the OOV is about OOV and OOV going down the OOV OOV for the OOV OOV .
That is an OOV of the position that we OOV here .
<P> I OOV to see a better OOV between Parliament and the Commission in the interest of all the countries in the OOV Mediterranean area .
There is a great deal of work to be done , it can be done and , indeed , it must be done .
<SPEAKER OOV LANGUAGE="SV" NAME=" OOV " > Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , Mediterranean cooperation has been OOV to OOV and OOV OOV in today ' s debate , as well as in the two reports that have been OOV .
I welcome this debate .
I have OOV OOV to the points of view OOV and OOV that the OOV made on a number of points are OOV .
I think that OOV with the OOV countries is extremely important .
The real OOV of the OOV OOV can only be OOV if all OOV feel that they really own the process and that they are responsible for its different OOV .
<P> OOV me to OOV OOV on some of the OOV OOV to this debate .
<P> Mr OOV OOV the issue of whether the enlargement process and Mediterranean cooperation are OOV OOV .
The OOV OOV from the presidency is OOV ; they must be OOV .
OOV like Mr OOV , we too , as OOV of the presidency , see no conflict between , on the one hand , enlargement and , on the other hand , Mediterranean cooperation .
We shall , and must , be able to OOV all our OOV to these two areas .
<P> I am very OOV that a number of OOV , particularly Mrs OOV and Mr OOV , OOV the importance of OOV OOV between the EU and the OOV countries .
We see these OOV as necessary OOV OOV for OOV a OOV area in the region .
The OOV is for these OOV to be OOV by OOV .
That is why , in the Council ' s view , it is important for this process to be OOV up .
<P> I OOV with OOV that it was possible to OOV the OOV agreement with OOV a few OOV OOV .
We hope that , during the Swedish Presidency , we shall be able to OOV an OOV OOV OOV with OOV .
It is also OOV that the OOV negotiations with OOV , OOV and OOV are OOV at a good OOV .
We believe , then , that these OOV OOV are not only of great importance to trade and economic OOV but are also an important political OOV .
They form the basis for a OOV , OOV and OOV political OOV .
<P> In today ' s debate , quite a OOV of OOV has been OOV against the OOV s aid to the Mediterranean .
The Council OOV that the OOV OOV OOV adopted last OOV may provide the opportunity for a more OOV and more OOV OOV of working .
Mr OOV OOV of the importance of the OOV ' role in Mediterranean cooperation .
I can only OOV with what Mr OOV said .
It is important to give OOV OOV to the OOV of the OOV regions and their OOV in Mediterranean cooperation .
The Council therefore OOV this as an OOV we should like to OOV to OOV further .
<P> Mr OOV OOV about what I think is a very important issue , OOV the OOV with OOV society .
At the social and cultural level , the presidency OOV just such a OOV between OOV and OOV as one of our most important OOV - an area in which , as OOV would have it , OOV has been able to OOV quite a OOV role for a long time .
OOV might be made , for example , of the OOV OOV OOV and the OOV OOV OOV from OOV , which provide OOV for OOV work in a long OOV of areas within this OOV .
<P> Mrs OOV OOV the OOV important cooperation taking place in the legal OOV .
The Swedish Presidency OOV to OOV cooperation in this area .
We shall be OOV a OOV meeting and a OOV .
OOV will be OOV to OOV to the Commission ' s new regional programmes in the legal and OOV policy areas .
OOV OOV to OOV , to which OOV OOV have OOV in today ' s debate , are an important part of this OOV of issues .
I think it is important for these OOV issues to be OOV in an OOV OOV in which we have to take account of social , economic and cultural OOV .
<P> The OOV we are now OOV into must be OOV upon OOV what OOV within the OOV OOV has already agreed about .
I believe it was Mr OOV I OOV who OOV about the OOV of OOV specific action .
Mrs OOV OOV upon the same subject .
I now believe that the EU , together with the OOV countries OOV the Mediterranean , must ensure that the OOV and OOV of the OOV OOV are OOV ' in action for , like any other OOV , the OOV OOV will be OOV not OOV to what it OOV but OOV to what it OOV .
<SPEAKER OOV NAME=" OOV " > Mr President , it OOV me very great OOV to OOV in this debate on the Mediterranean today .
I am particularly OOV to the two OOV , Mrs OOV and Mr OOV , for the excellent work that they have done in OOV their two reports .
It has been an extremely good debate .
It is OOV rather a OOV that many of those who were able to find time in their OOV OOV to take part in the debate were not able to find time to OOV very much of the debate or even to OOV OOV the end to OOV the OOV .
It is , I OOV , a OOV of OOV on my part to OOV to people who ask serious OOV but who are not able to OOV to OOV the OOV , so I will not do that .
I will just OOV to people who have been able to OOV OOV the end , which in fact OOV the debate some OOV .
<P> The Mediterranean is our OOV OOV , on our OOV OOV , so it should OOV a very OOV place in our OOV relations .
The OOV agreed at OOV OOV OOV OOV and they are OOV OOV : working together for peace and OOV , OOV OOV OOV through OOV OOV trade , OOV the economic and financial OOV to OOV the OOV which that OOV , and OOV to improve OOV OOV and OOV OOV OOV of different OOV and different OOV .
<P> As the House will know , I had long OOV that the time had come to see how we could improve the OOV of the OOV OOV .
We therefore OOV very OOV on a Commission OOV on OOV the OOV OOV , which in OOV OOV the main OOV for the OOV OOV OOV ' meeting in OOV last OOV where our OOV were OOV OOV .
That OOV was on the OOV , that OOV was the principle OOV for that meeting .
<P> I should like now to give you my OOV of where we OOV and where we should go from here .
OOV the OOV of the House , I will OOV points OOV from both reports in this OOV rather than OOV with each report OOV .
<P> OOV , OOV me look at the political situation in the region , which we are going to debate in a few OOV ' time .
OOV reports OOV the OOV OOV of the OOV OOV peace process for European Union policy in the Mediterranean .
I OOV the OOV in both reports for the European Union to OOV a more OOV role in the peace process .
<P> OOV us not OOV our contribution .
We are , for example , and it is not an OOV point to make , the major OOV to the Palestinian OOV .
OOV year EUR OOV million was OOV from the Community OOV , which OOV EUR OOV million for a OOV OOV OOV that I made available at the end of the year to help OOV the OOV framework of the Palestinian OOV , which we have OOV to OOV and OOV .
<P> I would like , without OOV , to thank the House - to thank this part of the OOV OOV - and also to thank the Council for their OOV in OOV that we could make that OOV OOV available before OOV .
As OOV have OOV OOV , it is going to be all too necessary .
<P> At the meeting in OOV , OOV OOV , OOV in my view , not to OOV agreement on the OOV OOV for OOV and OOV .
This was clearly not the right OOV .
OOV , in OOV a good deal of progress had been made towards agreement on this OOV .
We should make OOV that we can OOV on that progress when the time is right , so that it OOV a OOV OOV OOV , OOV the European Union ' s OOV OOV to OOV regional peace and OOV .
<P> In the OOV - and here I also OOV OOV made in both the reports that we are OOV - we should not OOV for the OOV to be in OOV to make more efforts to OOV respect for human rights and OOV OOV in the region .
OOV OOV is OOV on this subject .
The European Union should use all appropriate OOV to OOV for progress on these issues .
The OOV democracy programme should continue to be used to OOV positive OOV and OOV OOV themselves should be more OOV on OOV progress .
I very much welcome Parliament ' s OOV on this and I hope that the Council will also OOV OOV .
<P> OOV and financial OOV are , of course , at the OOV of the OOV OOV they are not , as OOV OOV OOV out , OOV like the whole of that OOV .
In OOV there was a high level of OOV on our proposals for OOV it and I would like to OOV the following : we must OOV up the OOV , OOV and OOV of the OOV OOV .
I am OOV to OOV that we are OOV OOV progress on this .
On OOV last OOV we OOV , at last , to OOV the agreement with OOV and we are OOV by the progress we are making with OOV , with OOV and with OOV .
I want to see negotiations with OOV , OOV and OOV OOV OOV this year , however the OOV process in the Member States is OOV OOV .
The agreement with OOV was OOV three years OOV , but it is still not in OOV .
OOV from the European Parliament in this respect would be most welcome .
I do hope that , as well as making OOV in the OOV , OOV Members will get on to their own OOV and OOV to ensure that when we OOV agreement on one of these OOV OOV it can be OOV OOV .
<P> There are two OOV which still have not OOV the OOV agreement - no OOV , as they say , no OOV OOV - but I very much hope that OOV and OOV OOV - I hope I have not given the OOV OOV - will get on to their OOV to OOV for OOV as OOV as possible .
<P> In OOV course we also need to OOV the issue of agricultural trade .
The OOV of our OOV OOV in being able to deal with OOV OOV like that and we need to have a OOV OOV .
We must OOV OOV trade and cooperation , including on a OOV basis .
We want all countries OOV an OOV agreement with us to OOV OOV OOV OOV themselves within OOV years .
This is the only OOV to OOV our already agreed OOV of an OOV OOV OOV area by OOV .
<P> The development of OOV trade needs to be OOV by greater OOV cooperation .
OOV OOV will not be used OOV the infrastructure is there .
We must OOV OOV of OOV for all OOV OOV OOV trade between themselves and OOV the OOV OOV on rules of OOV .
We must OOV measures OOV to the OOV market .
We want a OOV to be in place by next year for priority OOV - such as rules of OOV , OOV , OOV and OOV , and OOV OOV OOV - for implementation OOV in OOV , both between the OOV and the Union and OOV the OOV themselves .
<P> OOV this , together with the support we give to our OOV under OOV , will increase the OOV of the region to OOV .
A OOV and open market with a OOV and OOV legal and OOV environment is the best way to ensure that the very OOV OOV of local , European and OOV OOV will increase .
<P> OOV reports OOV OOV much attention to the need to improve OOV , which one or two of the OOV who are still present in the OOV mentioned during their OOV .
OOV , OOV has an excellent OOV on OOV but is much less good on OOV .
OOV year the OOV on OOV was OOV : the OOV OOV OOV that EUR OOV million or OOV % of available OOV were OOV and the OOV on OOV OOV to EUR OOV million or OOV % of available OOV .
I am OOV to say that the OOV of the OOV of OOV OOV to OOV the OOV has OOV to improve .
As an OOV over the last OOV years , we have now OOV OOV % of OOV OOV , OOV to OOV % one year OOV , but there is still a long way to go .
We are in the process of OOV two OOV , the OOV OOV OOV and the OOV Commission OOV .
OOV together , I am OOV that they will OOV about serious OOV in the years to come .
<P> Mr OOV OOV , Mr OOV , who I am OOV to say is still in his place , OOV about that and OOV a specific question about OOV and OOV and their OOV in regional programmes .
I am OOV to OOV OOV " - in the OOV .
It is a positive OOV " rather than OOV or OOV OOV " .
<P> I OOV the opinion that the OOV made available for the OOV 2000 to OOV is OOV .
I was not OOV to see that mentioned in the report .
It is certainly OOV that the EUR OOV OOV agreed by the Council - I give OOV no OOV - is less than the Commission had OOV .
OOV , together with OOV OOV , this means that OOV EUR OOV OOV will be available over that OOV , which is not an OOV OOV of OOV .
The important OOV now is to see that this OOV is used OOV in terms both of the quality of our OOV in OOV to the policy OOV and of OOV OOV on the OOV .
<P> The Commission has OOV that , for the future , OOV OOV should be more OOV OOV to the OOV process and the implementation of economic OOV .
I make no OOV for this and I am OOV to OOV support for this OOV in one of the reports .
<P> I have OOV the OOV to increase the OOV of Commission OOV available to work on this sector .
I OOV that the OOV concerned are extremely OOV OOV , but any decisions will have to be taken in the OOV of the OOV of Commission OOV OOV OOV and here again I would be OOV for OOV help from Parliament .
<P> We will also be working this year on a programme to take account of the social OOV of economic OOV .
This will OOV education and OOV , the OOV of the role of women and social security systems as well as OOV on health .
<P> I was not OOV that both reports OOV for OOV support for civil society .
I fully agree with these .
The question is how best to go about it .
I OOV that OOV OOV is not the OOV .
These are not OOV and they are OOV of OOV resources .
OOV cooperation is to be OOV , but not in the OOV of OOV the OOV Mediterranean OOV cooperation programmes .
However OOV their OOV , they were OOV OOV by the Court of OOV and indeed they were OOV OOV by this Parliament .
OOV we need to OOV more clearly to civil society - whether OOV , local authorities or other OOV - that our programmes are open to their OOV and they only need to OOV themselves to OOV to our OOV for proposals .
<P> OOV OOV of this already OOV in our OOV regional cooperation programmes , for example on the environment , the cultural heritage and OOV democracy .
I OOV to make a OOV OOV in this OOV and to OOV to OOV the approach .
In the OOV OOV , we could look at other OOV of OOV civil society and I should certainly be OOV to consider any OOV proposals which Parliament may put forward .
<P> Finally , I am OOV to OOV the agreement all OOV on the need to OOV the OOV of the OOV .
I OOV welcome Parliament ' s OOV in this respect through international OOV at all OOV .
I am only OOV that I will not be able to OOV the OOV on OOV and OOV OOV , but I am on a OOV OOV on those two OOV .
I hope Parliament will OOV .
We shall be OOV our OOV OOV through the OOV of a OOV programme OOV all the OOV OOV at our OOV to ensure that the OOV of what we are OOV is OOV as OOV as possible both in the European Union and OOV the Mediterranean OOV .
<P> OOV OOV , Mr OOV OOV OOV , who I am OOV to see in his place , said that we must not just give OOV OOV to our OOV in the OOV OOV .
OOV OOV , who I am OOV is not here , said we should give OOV of OOV action .
That is what we are OOV to do .
That is what the OOV that we put on the OOV in OOV OOV to do : a serious OOV to OOV the OOV OOV with OOV proposals for action .
<P> So , as far as we are concerned in the Commission , we do not want to make the same OOV OOV , we do not want to go on the same OOV OOV of OOV and OOV and OOV and OOV OOV .
We want to OOV all the OOV OOV and get them OOV and we have a good OOV of OOV at least another two OOV OOV this year ; I would hope for the OOV .
We must deal with issues like OOV trade and OOV , we must deal with regional cooperation , we have to OOV up OOV under OOV
This is not a OOV policy .
It is a real policy that we want to make work in real time .
I hope that in future OOV in Parliament - as well OOV from OOV to end as this one has been , at least in part - we will be able to OOV our progress in what must be one of the OOV for the OOV OOV of the European Union .
<P> OOV OOV OOV in the OOV OOV <SPEAKER OOV NAME=" President " > The next OOV is the Council and Commission OOV on the situation in the OOV OOV .
<P> I would like to welcome Mr OOV , OOV of the Council , and , without further OOV , I shall give OOV the OOV on behalf of the Council .
<SPEAKER OOV LANGUAGE="SV" NAME=" OOV " > Madam President , ladies and gentlemen , in view of the OOV OOV for OOV OOV on OOV OOV , the peace process in the OOV OOV is at an OOV OOV .
OOV the negotiations in OOV , the parties OOV OOV than OOV before to a OOV OOV .
At the same time , the OOV in the Palestinian areas and the OOV number of OOV and OOV has OOV a serious OOV in OOV between the OOV parties .
<P> The OOV Government OOV change , OOV of the OOV of the OOV for OOV OOV on OOV OOV but , at the same time , there should OOV be a OOV OOV for peace on the part of both the OOV and Palestinian OOV .
The OOV OOV for OOV OOV and the OOV OOV of a government will be important OOV in OOV the future OOV of the peace process .
<P> OOV the OOV , the parties have not OOV to OOV the progress OOV in OOV of OOV .
In OOV , the parties OOV OOV with each other and without any third OOV present .
The OOV on that OOV was serious and OOV , and both parties OOV themselves OOV about the OOV for OOV a OOV OOV .
However , time did not OOV any such OOV OOV to be OOV in OOV , but the parties agreed upon a OOV OOV OOV on OOV OOV which may OOV a OOV to OOV upon further OOV the negotiations for a OOV OOV are OOV .
I would OOV the OOV Members ' and Parliament ' s attention to the fact that this OOV particularly OOV the European Union ' s role in the OOV work for peace .
<P> The presidency is not OOV in OOV OOV from many OOV to see a OOV of the European Union ' s already major OOV to the whole OOV OOV issue .
The EU has an important role to OOV in as much as we are the most important OOV OOV of OOV all the countries in the area , as well as the OOV OOV of public aid to the Palestinian areas .
OOV its OOV OOV , Mr OOV , who has been present the whole time , the EU has of course been able to OOV the negotiations in OOV .
The very fact that Mr OOV has been able to OOV and OOV the European Union ' s support for the negotiations and its OOV to OOV the parties has been of great OOV to the Union .
<P> I also want to OOV that , in recent OOV , the presidency has had OOV OOV at the OOV level with both the OOV and Palestinian OOV .
A OOV OOV for the presidency in these OOV has been the European Union ' s OOV to OOV the parties in OOV way they wish .
OOV , these OOV have taken place in OOV OOV with the OOV OOV and the OOV OOV of the OOV
<P> I also want to OOV the OOV of the fact that the OOV OOV for the OOV OOV and OOV OOV , Mr OOV , is part of the international OOV under the OOV of OOV OOV which is OOV the current OOV in the Palestinian areas and which , OOV , will OOV OOV proposals to OOV a OOV of this OOV .
<P> The OOV OOV OOV has OOV the Palestinian OOV with OOV economic and OOV problems .
The Palestinian OOV has also been OOV with major OOV problems since the OOV Government OOV the OOV of OOV funds it is OOV to make in OOV with the ' OOV OOV ' .
In a OOV of OOV OOV , the OOV OOV Council OOV upon OOV to OOV these OOV .
On the initiative of Commissioner OOV , the European Union has also used OOV OOV in order to make funds OOV available to the Palestinian OOV .
<P> The human rights situation OOV to give OOV for concern .
The European Union has OOV with the Palestinian OOV in OOV with the OOV OOV OOV OOV out .
The Union has also OOV in OOV to OOV the OOV OOV of OOV , OOV by military OOV .
We shall continue to OOV these issues .
<P> OOV , there is no new information about OOV or progress in the peace negotiations between OOV and OOV and between OOV and OOV .
<P> In OOV with the parties and also in OOV OOV with the new OOV OOV , the European Union will continue to do what it can to OOV all OOV of the peace process to a OOV OOV .
<SPEAKER OOV LANGUAGE="ES " NAME=" OOV " > Madam President , I would like very OOV to OOV to OOV some more specific OOV , from a political point of view , to the OOV which the presidency has just made .
<P> I believe that today ' s debate is OOV given the time at which it is taking place .
I believe that we should OOV the debate on at least three OOV .
The first is what will the political OOV in OOV be like after the OOV on OOV OOV ?
The second , which the presidency also mentioned , is how can this OOV of OOV that we have OOV over recent OOV be OOV to an end ?
OOV the third , and OOV most important , is what OOV must we give to the peace process in OOV ?
<P> The year 2000 was a year of hope .
It OOV with the OOV that a OOV OOV could OOV be OOV .
OOV OOV measures were adopted in OOV to OOV .
OOV , however , 2000 OOV without us being able to achieve peace .
OOV us do OOV possible so that OOV might OOV be the year in which we do achieve it .
<P> The current situation is , of course , still very OOV .
I must OOV you that I OOV this very OOV in OOV OOV a meeting with the Swedish OOV OOV and OOV of the Council and the OOV of the United OOV .
We were OOV OOV OOV OOV when I OOV the OOV to come here and be with you this OOV .
<P> OOV OOV are taking place at the OOV ; OOV which we hope will OOV OOV , with the OOV of a OOV and OOV OOV before the OOV of OOV OOV .
I believe that there is still the OOV that this OOV will take place , and also the OOV that it may take place in Europe .
<P> As the presidency has clearly OOV out , we have OOV some OOV OOV OOV since OOV OOV of last year , and we have all been involved in an OOV OOV OOV .
So much so that , if you will OOV me , Madam President , I will OOV you that I OOV the first OOV of the year in OOV , together with Mr OOV and Mr OOV , and we made OOV progress .
<P> I believe that the OOV which OOV place in OOV , as the presidency has said , have been without OOV - OOV to all the OOV - the most OOV negotiations we have OOV had .
OOV has been made in all areas .
<P> On the issue of OOV , we are very OOV to OOV OOV an agreement - if there is OOV time to OOV it - on very OOV a OOV OOV OOV of the OOV , OOV some OOV OOV .
<P> OOV the security point of view , I believe that a good agreement can be OOV , OOV that there can be three OOV OOV OOV and that , OOV the OOV OOV , international OOV can be OOV to OOV OOV .
<P> On the issue of OOV , as you know , OOV are OOV , with some progress , on the problem of how to OOV the OOV OOV and the OOV OOV .
There has still been no OOV decision on this .
However , there is still a OOV to make progress and to OOV a OOV OOV on OOV .
<P> At the OOV OOV , progress has also been made on the issue of the OOV , and progress has been made on specific and OOV issues .
The OOV set up for this OOV has made OOV progress on all issues OOV to the OOV , although it has had to OOV , for the time being , the OOV OOV of the right to OOV .
They have OOV that issue in order to find specific and OOV OOV to specific and OOV problems , such as international OOV , how to find resources in the different countries to help in that OOV , OOV . <P> OOV , ladies and gentlemen , there is still reason to be OOV that we may OOV OOV a OOV agreement - a OOV hope , to be OOV , since there is OOV OOV of OOV a OOV agreement by OOV - or that we may OOV an OOV OOV from both OOV on a OOV of OOV so that , OOV the situation in OOV and the OOV after OOV OOV , there will always be a OOV of OOV that have been agreed on , OOV by both OOV , which means that we will not have to start the next negotiations OOV from OOV .
<P> I can OOV you that , on the part of the European Union , all the OOV OOV , with no OOV OOV , are going to OOV a OOV which is not only political but also OOV .
OOV OOV OOV OOV is OOV OOV OOV - and I have OOV this during the OOV we have OOV together on the OOV OOV the negotiations necessary to OOV a OOV - and , on our part , OOV do not have the OOV OOV that we will OOV OOV , OOV and OOV involved in it , because , as you know , a resolution to this conflict in the OOV OOV is in our interests , very much in our interests .
<P> It is also important to OOV the OOV OOV of the countries in the region .
OOV OOV and OOV continue to OOV a OOV and OOV OOV to OOV to find a OOV and OOV OOV .
There are going to be difficult OOV , without OOV , after the OOV ; there will be OOV and we will need to continue to have - as we OOV have always had - the OOV to continue OOV this peace process .
<P> OOV other points of view - from the economic point of view - the presidency has already OOV what we are OOV .
I am OOV the Commission will also do so .
We will continue the OOV that the European Union has always OOV .
<P> I would like to say a few words also about the committee of OOV , the committee which OOV from the OOV OOV meeting .
The committee has OOV well for some time but , as of a OOV OOV , the OOV Government OOV to OOV OOV with it OOV after the OOV .
OOV , although there is still a OOV from the committee still OOV on the OOV , we OOV of the committee as such will not go to the OOV OOV OOV OOV .
That is what I can OOV you at the OOV .
<P> Finally , I would like to OOV that we will continue to work over the OOV OOV with energy and OOV and , if OOV a OOV is OOV , the European OOV will OOV it and will do OOV possible to OOV this process in the right OOV .
<P> <SPEAKER OOV NAME=" OOV " > Madam President , I am very OOV for this opportunity to OOV OOV in this debate .
I do not OOV to OOV any of the things I said in the last debate OOV do I OOV to OOV what the President and the OOV OOV have just said , not because it is not important , but because OOV would OOV the OOV of the House .
<P> OOV , we all hope for progress in the peace OOV .
OOV , we all believe it would be OOV to OOV on the OOV OOV in OOV .
It is for the people of OOV to make their OOV OOV and then for the OOV of us to deal with the OOV .
OOV , we are all OOV concerned about the OOV of life on both OOV .
There have already been a high number of OOV because of an OOV use of OOV and we are OOV OOV about the OOV OOV OOV by OOV security OOV .
OOV only does this OOV the OOV of OOV a OOV OOV , it is also OOV for a OOV OOV to OOV to such means in OOV OOV of human rights and the OOV of law .
<P> OOV me be OOV clear , we are also OOV concerned by the OOV of OOV OOV by OOV and by the recent OOV of OOV .
This too is OOV , especially given the Palestinian authorities ' OOV OOV to a OOV on the OOV OOV .
<P> We also OOV concerned about the OOV situation in the OOV OOV and OOV .
The OOV OOV by OOV are having OOV OOV on the Palestinian OOV and therefore , not OOV , on political OOV .
They are even OOV the OOV of OOV aid to the Palestinian OOV .
For example , the Palestinian OOV has OOV the Commission ' s OOV in OOV that the OOV OOV of the OOV OOV - a OOV with which this Parliament is OOV all too OOV - OOV OOV for OOV , has had to be OOV OOV further OOV .
The situation has OOV further , and OOV and OOV are OOV from even OOV the OOV .
OOV OOV and OOV , such as OOV , OOV and OOV , cannot OOV the OOV and further OOV work has had to be OOV .
<P> In its OOV implementation report following the OOV OOV OOV , OOV also OOV concern about serious OOV in the OOV of OOV , the OOV of OOV OOV , OOV OOV and other OOV OOV .
The security of OOV OOV in OOV OOV has been OOV OOV .
<P> I very much OOV that the situation has OOV to OOV .
However , we have OOV to make our position OOV clear .
We have OOV that the OOV OOV on the Palestinian OOV should be OOV .
We have OOV OOV to end OOV the OOV of OOV OOV OOV to the Palestinian OOV and we have OOV OOV to the OOV by OOV both the OOV situation and the OOV OOV situation of the Palestinian OOV .
<P> In OOV the Commission OOV EUR OOV million in OOV aid , EUR OOV million OOV to OOV in OOV to its OOV OOV .
In OOV , we OOV a EUR OOV million OOV OOV OOV in the OOV that it was in the interest of both OOV not to OOV the Palestinian OOV ' s OOV to OOV OOV .
In the same OOV , the Commission set up the new OOV OOV of EUR OOV million which the presidency OOV to .
I am very OOV to Parliament and the Council for making that OOV OOV possible before OOV .
OOV OOV I OOV a first OOV of EUR OOV million to the Palestinian OOV .
<P> We need to look at the OOV situation for the OOV of this year .
As our resources are OOV , we need to OOV OOV how to OOV further .
If we continue OOV OOV OOV from the OOV OOV OOV in order to OOV the current OOV needs of the Palestinian OOV , including OOV of civil OOV ' OOV , education , health and other public services , funds will very OOV OOV out .
<P> The Palestinian OOV is now OOV an OOV OOV in OOV and a OOV OOV .
They will need to OOV their OOV .
OOV of just OOV out OOV we need to look at how to help over the OOV OOV .
OOV the European Union and the OOV international OOV have an interest in OOV the economic and OOV framework of the Palestinian OOV , which we have OOV to OOV and which we have OOV to OOV more OOV than any one OOV .
<P> If the Palestinian OOV OOV , it would be a very OOV OOV to OOV for peace in the region , OOV security would be OOV and our efforts to OOV cooperation and OOV in the OOV OOV would be OOV .
That is why both the Palestinian OOV and the international OOV at OOV must look OOV the OOV OOV and consider how to deal with the OOV OOV OOV in Palestinian OOV .
<P> There is one other point I should make and I make it with all OOV OOV , but I do not think that it is OOV to the OOV of OOV Members of this House who have OOV been in the region .
OOV the OOV problems OOV by the Palestinian OOV , with which I OOV OOV , OOV would OOV OOV that OOV OOV the level of OOV that we have the right to OOV from any OOV of our funds and that citizens in any OOV have every right to OOV from their OOV OOV .
I believe I am right in OOV , as I mentioned a OOV or two OOV , that some OOV Members who have OOV been in the area have OOV OOV on this subject .
<P> We wish to OOV our part in OOV the Palestinian OOV , but if we are to do that then we have to be able to OOV the OOV OOV of the European Union , which has to OOV to Europe ' s OOV , that the OOV we make available is being well OOV and OOV OOV .
<P> I OOV what I said just now , that we want to do what we can to OOV the Palestinian OOV .
I hope very much that the authorities in OOV will end the economic and financial OOV of Palestinian areas because , in the OOV , the OOV and the long OOV , this will increase OOV and OOV the OOV .
<P> <SPEAKER OOV LANGUAGE="ES " NAME=" OOV OOV " > Mr President , I would like to OOV by OOV both the Council and the Commission for their information and OOV and by OOV that my group is also OOV OOV - OOV us hope OOV that the OOV OOV by the OOV OOV OOV to be right - at this very OOV time just a few OOV before the OOV in OOV , and in the OOV of a OOV of government in the United States , which will have to OOV its policy in the region .
<P> However , we must not OOV that , up OOV today , there have been more than OOV OOV as a result of the OOV , which has taken us back to a situation which we OOV we would OOV see again .
OOV group also OOV the OOV European OOV in the region over recent OOV as something to be OOV OOV .
As the presidency mentioned , it is OOV that the OOV of Mr OOV in OOV OOV and the committee of OOV , and the OOV of the European Union in OOV through its OOV OOV , OOV OOV , have OOV us to make OOV OOV to the peace process .
<P> We believe that we have to OOV this OOV for political OOV in the region on the part of the European Union , which we believe is OOV with the OOV role which the United States Government must continue to OOV in this whole process .
In OOV , both OOV OOV that they have OOV been so OOV to a OOV agreement , but we must be aware that the OOV OOV must not make us OOV to the real situation .
The OOV and the OOV must be aware that they OOV a common OOV , the OOV to which OOV of one OOV or another OOV , which is the main OOV to the peace process and to OOV and OOV in the region , and which also OOV an OOV OOV to the whole of the Mediterranean region .
<P> On the other hand , I believe that we must be aware that we are OOV with a national conflict , OOV down from OOV , which has OOV the education systems of some countries and has OOV OOV OOV the OOV OOV , which means that we clearly cannot OOV a OOV OOV and that we must OOV the problem with OOV .
I think it is OOV appropriate to OOV the OOV on the OOV OOV peace process to the new OOV which the European Union is OOV to give to the OOV OOV , as we are OOV this OOV and as Commissioner OOV has done , because OOV the OOV contribution Europe can make at the OOV to the peace process is to OOV OOV the OOV of OOV cooperation , OOV its OOV and OOV its development in the OOV of political OOV .
<P> OOV OOV and OOV have come to OOV OOV that it is OOV to end the OOV and OOV a OOV of security in the region , but they have also OOV together on the development of OOV OOV to OOV the problems OOV them : OOV , the OOV OOV of OOV , the OOV and the OOV which Mr OOV OOV to .
The European Union has the particular responsibility of OOV these OOV OOV the OOV political OOV of recent OOV .
We must support both OOV in their OOV towards a OOV to the conflict , OOV on the OOV resolution of OOV , on OOV , on respect for human rights and the OOV of peace .
<SPEAKER OOV LANGUAGE="ES " NAME=" OOV > Mr President , Mr OOV of the Council , Commissioner , OOV OOV for the OOV OOV and OOV OOV , from your OOV a few OOV OOV , it OOV that you OOV another OOV : high OOV for hope .
OOV us hope that you are right OOV
OOV I do not OOV your OOV , even OOV it is OOV , but I OOV that your words have , to some OOV , OOV my concerns .
<P> OOV and gentlemen , although the peace process may have OOV out of OOV , the OOV OOV still OOV and are OOV .
OOV , the OOV OOV OOV still OOV and continue to be in OOV .
No one , Mr OOV OOV , can OOV OOV on their OOV , in OOV terms and under international law .
I OOV OOV to the ' OOV for OOV ' principle , OOV OOV , which has OOV the basis for OOV and negotiations since OOV .
<P> OOV , the OOV Council OOV OOV OOV , OOV , and OOV to say , also No OOV on OOV , must be OOV , so as to OOV the OOV for a just and OOV peace .
<P> OOV , I come to the OOV problems that we must OOV if peace is to be OOV , as you OOV said Mr OOV : the OOV of all OOV OOV and OOV of all OOV on these OOV , OOV to have rights to OOV of OOV , the OOV of the OOV of Palestinian OOV , which OOV OOV the OOV OOV of all .
<P> I shall OOV by OOV something that has been said and given OOV OOV before in this House .
The European Union has a OOV OOV OOV , and it is OOV for OOV of OOV , to OOV a political role in this peace process , which is in OOV with its political OOV .
The OOV of OOV of the OOV , OOV to which the OOV made policy and the European Union OOV for it , is no OOV OOV .
OOV has it OOV any OOV result to OOV .
It is not a case of the EU OOV into the OOV of the OOV in the peace process , rather , what we want is for the European Union to OOV OOV with the OOV in a OOV to find a just OOV .
OOV that would be what I would call a new peace process .
<P> OOV your OOV , Mr OOV , and that of the OOV OOV , OOV OOV OOV a new framework for peace negotiations .
We would like to think that this new OOV will be OOV and will OOV better results than its OOV .
<P> ( OOV ) <SPEAKER OOV NAME=" President " > OOV you very much , Mr OOV .
Parliament is OOV at how OOV you OOV between OOV , so much so all we can OOV is the OOV OOV
<SPEAKER OOV OOV " OOV OOV OOV " > Mr President , the EU is the OOV OOV to the Palestinian OOV .
OOV to the OOV , since the OOV , more than one million OOV have been OOV under the OOV OOV of two OOV a OOV .
The human OOV of the OOV is OOV even OOV .
Commissioner OOV OOV it a OOV OOV : OOV people cannot even get to the European OOV in OOV because even OOV cannot get through the OOV .
It is therefore of OOV importance that we continue OOV aid .
I am OOV that the Council and Commission OOV our view .
<P> I OOV from the Palestinian OOV last OOV together with a OOV from Parliament .
We are all agreed on one OOV : it is important to give OOV , but we are not OOV enough .
The Union must also OOV its political responsibility .
It is only OOV to OOV a OOV role in the peace process in very small OOV .
That is OOV not least to the OOV within the Union .
I would therefore like to OOV from Mr OOV what he OOV to do in order to OOV the Union to OOV from the same OOV .
<P> OOV OOV OOV of OOV are available , as well as OOV for the OOV , and a OOV for the OOV of and OOV for OOV , I OOV whether the Union will have the OOV OOV it OOV to OOV an OOV position of its own , or will we OOV this to the OOV ?
<P> We must make OOV this OOV does not become OOV and OOV .
OOV OOV a certain OOV of OOV , Europe could , in fact , make a OOV contribution .
OOV OOV of this conflict are OOV OOV .
We must call them both to OOV about this .
OOV people is OOV under any OOV , whether this is in the form of OOV OOV out by the Palestinian OOV or the OOV OOV ' s OOV policy .
But , Mr OOV , Europe will OOV itself open to the OOV that it is OOV OOV OOV if it OOV OOV and a OOV OOV to call the OOV to account , OOV this is done OOV in the case of OOV .
<P> This Parliament too , with its OOV OOV , one for OOV and one for the Palestinian OOV , is OOV the OOV of OOV out the OOV OOV .
We must now work on OOV and OOV of the OOV concerns on both OOV .
<SPEAKER OOV OOV " NAME=" OOV > Mr President , if OOV OOV , last OOV ' s OOV of the OOV OOV to the Palestinian OOV OOV that over the OOV OOV OOV , the situation has taken a OOV OOV for the OOV .
OOV my most recent OOV at the start of the OOV , it was OOV that OOV , there was a future for a OOV Palestinian state .
If you now OOV OOV in OOV or OOV , it is OOV to see that the OOV has OOV OOV out .
This is as a result of the OOV trade OOV up OOV and of the policy of OOV by the OOV government , which is OOV OOV of OOV of workers from OOV into work .
<P> The political situation too has OOV OOV OOV to the OOV OOV .
This is now OOV on the Palestinian OOV , and given the OOV OOV out by the OOV government , this is a very OOV OOV .
The European Union was right to OOV this policy , all be it a OOV OOV .
In OOV , my OOV after last OOV ' s OOV , if I am being OOV , is a very OOV one .
<P> In all OOV , I am not OOV out too much hope for the future OOV .
In that OOV , I OOV the view of Mr OOV .
OOV OOV is that the peace process will OOV to a OOV as a result of the OOV OOV of the OOV OOV and the fact that I think that the OOV government - which I am certain will OOV be a OOV - will OOV OOV OOV OOV in the OOV of international OOV .
<P> But this OOV could be a OOV in OOV if the European Union were to use that time to its own OOV .
This is possible and would be possible if it were to use its role as OOV OOV to the OOV and as OOV ' s OOV OOV OOV in an OOV OOV .
<P> OOV regard to the OOV , I believe that the European Union should OOV as OOV .
It should use its role as OOV OOV to OOV the OOV to end the OOV OOV , which many people OOV against and are OOV about at regional level .
OOV , the Palestinian authorities should respect human rights to a much OOV OOV , not only in terms of OOV but also , for example , in its OOV of OOV .
It would be OOV , with regard to OOV human rights , for the European Union to OOV OOV OOV if in OOV OOV were to change .
<P> Finally , I would like to OOV on the OOV .
OOV OOV are OOV in order to OOV the OOV of the Palestinian OOV .
As for OOV , I believe that the European Union should OOV OOV in no OOV that if , after the OOV OOV , OOV OOV , if the OOV policy does not change and if there is no OOV in their OOV to OOV an agreement , then we cannot OOV in a OOV OOV .
We cannot continue to deal with a OOV who OOV to do what we have been OOV for for years .
We should have the OOV to OOV the necessary OOV , to OOV to the rules in the OOV OOV and OOV to take measures .
If the European Union OOV this economic position to its OOV , it could well OOV a political role in future , a political role which does OOV to the OOV of the region and the interests of the Union itself .
<P> <SPEAKER OOV OOV " NAME=" OOV > Mr President , in OOV , President OOV OOV the need for peace and OOV an OOV account of the OOV , OOV OOV conditions of the Palestinian people , who are OOV to OOV of human rights by the OOV OOV .
The OOV OOV this as greater OOV on OOV 's part with regard to peace and OOV OOV for not OOV up to OOV .
The OOV of the matter is that OOV OOV that what OOV is OOV is OOV .
The OOV of our OOV OOV to the area also OOV to OOV this .
<P> The Palestinian people are OOV to OOV in an OOV OOV , the OOV OOV into and out of the OOV are under military OOV and OOV OOV , OOV OOV points on the main OOV OOV the OOV from OOV their OOV of work and OOV OOV are OOV .
This is just one example : OOV was OOV on OOV OOV at a OOV point .
At the next OOV point OOV OOV OOV was OOV .
The OOV had OOV the OOV of OOV at OOV OOV and OOV at OOV OOV at OOV OOV
The OOV should have taken OOV OOV .
OOV OOV OOV was OOV in the OOV OOV OOV OOV .
OOV who are OOV OOV are OOV back and OOV OOV OOV up .
<P> In OOV , we OOV OOV of OOV of OOV where OOV OOV OOV and OOV and OOV OOV had been OOV and OOV , and OOV OOV .
It had become OOV OOV .
OOV there something OOV with the OOV ?
OOV in that they could have OOV as OOV for any Palestinian OOV against the OOV who are OOV the country and OOV it as OOV , OOV Palestinian OOV and OOV .
OOV , the number of OOV and OOV is OOV every OOV in what OOV to be the State of OOV , the OOV which have been OOV since OOV .
<P> The Palestinian OOV Council cannot OOV OOV .
The OOV of the different OOV are OOV to OOV about or to OOV .
OOV OOV said that his OOV are OOV .
OOV have OOV of the OOV OOV of the OOV .
OOV and OOV are OOV , and the European Union is OOV to that : every OOV , the Commission in OOV OOV OOV of the various OOV ; even civil OOV and OOV OOV by the European Union have been OOV .
These are economic OOV OOV OOV will be OOV for years to come .
<P> OOV this is OOV , and OOV of us , particularly those in responsible political OOV , can say that they were OOV of the OOV .
OOV OOV OOV back clear reports on the OOV OOV policy and also clear reports - as we OOV all the Palestinian OOV we OOV - of the OOV OOV by the OOV Palestinian OOV .
But they all OOV us - from OOV to the OOV and women in the OOV OOV - why Europe does not OOV in an OOV , political way .
" We have OOV in Europe , " they said , " and a political OOV with the OOV and OOV OOV would OOV Europe . "
This is our view as well : Europe must be able to OOV an OOV OOV policy which is in OOV with the OOV OOV which we always OOV to OOV : respect for international OOV and human rights .
In terms of OOV , that means OOV the OOV OOV .
<P> There is a OOV OOV in the OOV ; we have OOV it and it was OOV at OOV as well : they are OOV in implementation but OOV when it OOV to OOV and rights .
We , too , should have OOV this , for we are always OOV it .
Mr OOV is right : Europe is now OOV a OOV role but it must do much more .
The United States has OOV : our OOV is not to OOV it but to become OOV OOV in the negotiations .
It is not enough for us to provide economic aid : what we are being OOV for - and our responsibility OOV <P> ( The President OOV the OOV OOV ) <SPEAKER OOV OOV " NAME=" OOV > Mr President , OOV of the Council Presidency and the Commission , OOV OOV , ladies and gentlemen , I have , of course , OOV to all the OOV and I have also OOV the reports .
In my view , the real OOV of the problem , OOV and OOV against the OOV of the OOV OOV the European Union themselves , from the Treaty of OOV OOV , and against OOV and European law , has been OOV from all your OOV , OOV for the OOV OOV , OOV like a OOV , of human rights and so on and so OOV .
<P> The present situation OOV us in the same OOV of OOV with the OOV of the OOV , with the OOV and OOV , those that OOV the right to life and OOV to OOV the law , as we OOV from OOV OOV in what was to become the OOV OOV .
There is no OOV , no OOV of the OOV OOV of our Union in our approach today , at least in terms of the OOV OOV set OOV in the human rights OOV and in the OOV of the rights of European citizens and OOV .
There is OOV of this in what the OOV OOV , Mr OOV , OOV , OOV and , most OOV , OOV OOV as an EU OOV policy , a OOV , OOV OOV with no OOV OOV in terms of OOV implementation or OOV .
<P> This is our problem : there you are , Mrs OOV and OOV , OOV over OOV to OOV us about the OOV and OOV of the OOV , of Palestinian OOV and women , of OOV OOV and women , of the OOV OOV .
You are so OOV , so OOV , with such clear , OOV OOV ; you only OOV OOV or Palestinian OOV and women if they are on the OOV end of an OOV OOV , in which case you give them the OOV of a OOV , the OOV of your OOV .
In the OOV of the Palestinian , OOV or OOV OOV citizens , who OOV every OOV , OOV by their OOV or OOV right - or OOV OOV , OOV by the OOV , OOV OOV of OOV and OOV OOV OOV , who are OOV with the great OOV OOV and with you , the more or less OOV OOV ; in the OOV of the situation of the OOV , which is not just a OOV problem but also an OOV problem and the problem of OOV as well ; in the OOV of the OOV OOV of the OOV and Palestinian OOV and women , you are only concerned with them if OOV is involved , and it may have done them some serious OOV .
You only OOV the OOV of the Palestinian people when they further your OOV of your current OOV OOV , be it the United States of OOV , OOV or the European Union , which is OOV to OOV certain OOV , as it did in the case of OOV and OOV , as it did OOV the OOV in OOV .
<P> OOV , Mr President , this is the OOV of the matter : the OOV OOV to peace is OOV 's real OOV .
OOV might be OOV to take a OOV - and this is why the OOV people OOV , OOV , to OOV the OOV OOV OOV to the OOV , OOV , OOV OOV - but it OOV that any OOV could OOV out to be OOV OOV to the peace to be OOV .
This is the problem : when there are OOV , OOV OOV of OOV to OOV , one more OOV OOV might , in OOV , OOV one more OOV to OOV from in a OOV OOV OOV by an OOV peace agreement .
This is what they OOV .
But who OOV , OOV ?
The OOV democracy is OOV of this , but you could not OOV less OOV
For OOV 's OOV OOV
What OOV of Europe is this ?
If OOV , the right to national and OOV OOV is not to have OOV % of your OOV OOV on the OOV of the local OOV , on OOV OOV and OOV , OOV , military and OOV OOV OOV of OOV and women OOV OOV
OOV is it OOV down that the European Union must be the OOV of the national OOV , of their OOV and OOV ?
OOV in our OOV and OOV does the OOV OOV right to the national state OOV today : civil , political and human rights with regard to any state , OOV or OOV OOV do OOV , and you are OOV of all this OOV <P> OOV must become part of the European Union , one of our OOV .
OOV does not OOV OOV that it cannot continue to OOV itself as a national State , a small OOV of democracy but OOV for OOV years , more so with each OOV OOV , to OOV its own life and peace and the peace of OOV .
OOV this , Mr President , is our hope : we are OOV a OOV OOV , which has already been OOV by OOV Members , OOV for the full OOV of OOV in our Union .
A OOV will have to be OOV in OOV and in OOV OOV but it is an OOV matter .
As OOV , this is our OOV and we will make every OOV to achieve it , for it is a OOV course of action which will OOV to OOV .
<SPEAKER OOV OOV " NAME=" OOV " > Mr President , I was OOV to OOV the OOV which the OOV Council OOV OOV last OOV OOV the OOV OOV peace process .
The OOV to work in OOV cooperation with the new OOV OOV OOV within this OOV OOV OOV the support of the European Parliament .
This view OOV OOV to an OOV of the political OOV of the European Union in the OOV OOV .
This OOV was OOV very OOV by the OOV OOV of the OOV , Mr OOV , in a recent OOV with the OOV OOV : " We can be OOV , OOV OOV , and OOV financial aid , but we also know our OOV .
The only country which can provide OOV security OOV for both OOV is the United States . "
<P> In its OOV , the OOV Council also particularly OOV OOV and OOV to make every OOV to OOV the current negotiations in OOV to a OOV end .
OOV to OOV from both OOV , these have now been OOV , and not without hope for the future .
<P> However , how , in this specific OOV , have the Council and Commission taken the OOV OOV which the President of the Palestinian OOV , Mr OOV , OOV at the state of OOV and its OOV OOV , in OOV at the OOV of this OOV ?
OOV the OOV of the OOV presidency OOV to be OOV on OOV OOV , this OOV OOV OOV OOV the plan for a meeting between the OOV OOV OOV OOV and OOV in OOV today .
<P> Mr President , I would therefore like to OOV the view of the Council and Commission on Mr OOV ' s international OOV , which was OOV but OOV .
<P> At the end of its OOV , the OOV Council OOV OOV on its economic and financial policy OOV the Palestinian OOV .
However , an OOV OOV OOV on the public OOV of two OOV OOV ' by the same Palestinian OOV is OOV from this OOV .
OOV is this ?
OOV all , the Palestinian human rights organisations OOV OOV a OOV against a OOV OOV OOV process which was OOV with good reason .
I take it that the Council and Commission are not OOV their own OOV of OOV OOV of law on a OOV basis .
<P> Mr President , the clear OOV taken by the Swedish Presidency and Commissioner OOV in this debate have not OOV my OOV .
<SPEAKER OOV LANGUAGE="FR" NAME=" OOV " > Mr President , the European Union can no OOV OOV itself to OOV from OOV what is OOV on the other OOV of the Mediterranean and clear its OOV by making OOV OOV OOV of funds , the use of which it has not always been able to OOV , as Commissioner OOV has just OOV us in so OOV a OOV .
<P> The European Union must OOV its OOV OOV , OOV our OOV OOV .
This is what you are OOV to achieve , Mr OOV , in OOV OOV with Mr OOV and many of us welcome the work that you have OOV to this end .
OOV OOV for the results of the OOV taking place in OOV and those which will OOV OOV the results of the OOV OOV in OOV , we OOV that you are OOV to be OOV and that it is difficult for you to make any OOV of OOV at this time , Mr OOV , even if we might have OOV a OOV of OOV in your OOV , something we should be only too OOV to OOV .
The view of the Group of the European OOV ' s OOV , one I am OOV is OOV by many of the Members in other political OOV , is that , through your work , the European Union should be involved , OOV OOV , in the current OOV OOV in order to OOV the OOV OOV that OOV before the OOV OOV to be OOV .
The European Union can put itself forward as OOV only on OOV that it is OOV .
It cannot be OOV , as if it were not already OOV involved .
OOV , OOV , this is not the OOV that was OOV given by the European Union , when it OOV that it was OOV in its opinion in the vote within the United OOV OOV OOV of OOV OOV 2000 .
<P> Mr OOV , if you are to OOV on behalf of the European Union , we must OOV a OOV OOV .
So what is the state of OOV ?
I OOV the question to you as well as to the Council OOV .
In your work with the OOV of the Member States , have you OOV any OOV to OOV our points of view ?
That is my first question .
<P> OOV second question is OOV to both the Council and the Commission .
It is the same question that I OOV you in the OOV debate , Mr OOV , when you could not find the time to give an OOV .
OOV you not think that the time has come for the European Union to take some OOV action on the OOV of OOV ?
As I OOV , we OOV the OOV of the OOV and his Palestinian OOV make some OOV proposals at OOV .
Mr OOV , can we OOV on you to make it clear to your OOV OOV , in the necessary OOV and OOV OOV , that OOV is not just a OOV OOV to OOV and OOV but also to all OOV of OOV ?
<SPEAKER OOV OOV " NAME=" OOV > Mr President , this debate is one more OOV that OOV us that the OOV peace means OOV if it is not OOV by a political OOV , if it is not OOV by the OOV to take the OOV of making a decision .
OOV is a OOV OOV if the European Union is OOV to use it but is not able to OOV it up with action .
The action OOV for is political action , the full , OOV OOV of political responsibility in the OOV OOV peace process .
The European Union , Mr President , must be fully involved in the peace process as more than OOV a OOV OOV or a major OOV country , or it will not be involved at all .
I would OOV you of the OOV which a number of other Members have already OOV clearly : on the one hand , three United OOV OOV on OOV and OOV OOV , OOV by OOV even in terms of the OOV of the OOV they OOV ; and , on the other hand , a OOV state of OOV in the Palestinian OOV : OOV OOV workers OOV from working , three OOV OOV OOV of OOV already done , OOV only OOV to government OOV and OOV OOV to the OOV of European Union OOV OOV , OOV the OOV OOV under OOV years OOV OOV .
Mr President , I do not OOV which OOV OOV the OOV : whether they are OOV by OOV , OOV or OOV , it is the OOV of the European Union to OOV the OOV of OOV .
<P> OOV , Mr President , I am extremely concerned about OOV , a OOV which should have no place in a OOV on the OOV OOV or Palestinian issues but which , I OOV to say , OOV to the situation we have to OOV on .
OOV OOV is that a system OOV in the region OOV an OOV life and an OOV life have different OOV , particularly in terms of OOV and OOV to the situation .
<P> In the OOV of all this , it is OOV to OOV a OOV OOV .
We must OOV rules and OOV , especially if the OOV government is going to OOV OOV of OOV the OOV of these rules and OOV or OOV to do so .
It is OOV - as Mr OOV said - that the negotiations are OOV , but , OOV the negotiations , the OOV government is also OOV with the OOV of OOV OOV .
<P> This is why we cannot fully OOV Mr OOV 's OOV .
Commissioner OOV OOV us that we must look OOV the OOV OOV .
We agree .
OOV our political OOV is to achieve a peace agreement ; OOV it will be to ensure that the agreement and international law are OOV : the OOV OOV is OOV on Europe , Mr President , because it has OOV in Europe .
If we do not believe in Europe OOV , then their OOV will be of no OOV .
<SPEAKER OOV LANGUAGE="FR" NAME=" OOV " > Mr President , as some OOV have already said , the OOV of this debate is OOV , not just for the parties involved but for the European Union too .
<P> It is OOV , first of all , because the OOV of the OOV OOV OOV is OOV .
This OOV , all OOV of time has been OOV , OOV the OOV results .
The OOV at OOV were also OOV , at least OOV , even OOV they did OOV to make progress in terms of OOV up OOV on OOV such as OOV , OOV , and Palestinian OOV .
Finally , although I OOV up on Mr OOV ' s OOV , the OOV of OOV a OOV this OOV in OOV has been put OOV too , following Mr OOV ' s OOV made at OOV on OOV , which was OOV , or to put it more OOV , was OOV , to say the very least .
<P> It is a OOV time too , as I was OOV , because of the OOV in the United States .
OOV OOV is no OOV in OOV .
President OOV had made the peace process one of the OOV on his OOV .
OOV time will OOV how OOV OOV and OOV OOV now see their role in the OOV OOV .
At any OOV , this is the first time for years , as Mr OOV said , that high level OOV have taken place , as they did most OOV at OOV , without OOV OOV present , but with Mr OOV , our EU peace OOV .
This may be Europe ' s opportunity to make progress and to OOV a more OOV political role in this matter , to OOV OOV for its OOV and its OOV , since we are OOV to do more than just OOV the region .
We know that our aid is OOV necessary for the OOV OOV economic situation is OOV , but we would like to OOV much more than just OOV .
We would like to OOV our OOV , such as democracy , respect for human rights , education and OOV .
At this point , I welcome Mr OOV s OOV to OOV in the use of European aid .
In the words of OOV OOV , " OOV cannot be OOV by OOV but can be OOV by OOV . "
OOV us work together from now on so that the European Union can be a OOV in OOV this OOV .
<SPEAKER OOV NAME=" OOV " > Mr President , I would like to OOV , if I may , Mr OOV and my very good OOV Commissioner OOV to OOV OOV in OOV to the OOV OOV at this present time .
I say that , not because I am OOV an OOV for a European OOV policy , but because I believe that at this present time in OOV we are in a very difficult situation .
<P> We have an OOV and I must OOV the House that the State of OOV is the only democracy that OOV in the region and that is something that is OOV OOV .
We have an OOV for a OOV OOV which will be OOV in OOV to the future of the peace process so we must take OOV not to be OOV as OOV or OOV .
I OOV the House , because I OOV there is much OOV that Mr OOV may be OOV OOV OOV , that the peace process in the OOV OOV , from the OOV point of view , has always OOV under the OOV right and it was OOV OOV who OOV the OOV with OOV .
<P> I ask the House and I ask the Commission and the Council to OOV with OOV .
I ask the European Union to do what it does best .
It has an OOV over the OOV and it should OOV that OOV .
It should be OOV OOV OOV , for example , why the OOV OOV in their OOV the OOV of OOV which I OOV we had long put to one OOV in this world .
We should be OOV OOV OOV to ensure that the aid that OOV to the OOV OOV to those who really need it .
<P> So , in small measures and not in OOV - because the United States must take the OOV in these OOV - the European Union can OOV a role , but it should not OOV its importance .
The role is with the parties themselves , OOV by the great OOV OOV the OOV .
<SPEAKER OOV LANGUAGE="ES " NAME=" OOV OOV " > Mr President , in this long peace process in the OOV OOV , we feel as if we are on a OOV of OOV OOV .
OOV and time again we feel as if we are OOV and OOV OOV a OOV and then , when it OOV as if we are about to OOV the OOV , we OOV OOV back to OOV one .
This is a OOV and OOV OOV and OOV - and it is also a OOV like the OOV of OOV - which OOV to OOV the OOV and even the hope of OOV OOV .
<P> At the current time - and OOV having OOV OOV words - one has the OOV that we are once again at the OOV of the OOV , with an OOV OOV which has been OOV by many , with the conflict on the OOV at an OOV and with OOV in OOV which OOV to OOV an OOV which is far from OOV to peace .
<P> OOV , it is now that we have to OOV the OOV of our OOV and increase our efforts .
OOV this process can be OOV up in two OOV : OOV , we cannot OOV OOV of our OOV OOV , which is peace in the region , a peace which must be OOV and OOV on the basis of an OOV by all OOV of the rules of international law and decisions of the OOV OOV Council : and , OOV , Europe must once and for all , in OOV to OOV this conflict , OOV the responsibility that OOV our political OOV , our OOV and our interests .
<P> It is OOV OOV OOV OOV to continue to OOV the OOV role which we should OOV , OOV OOV to being , rather than OOV , OOV OOV to what the United States does or does not do .
We are , OOV , still in the OOV situation of OOV but not OOV ' .
The OOV of OOV OOV have been OOV but , in order to be more OOV , he needs political support which , OOV , he is not being given .
<P> I believe that the Union should no OOV OOV in taking a OOV role , and it is not enough to make OOV but it should be OOV OOV and OOV with OOV including OOV economic and political OOV .
<SPEAKER OOV OOV " NAME=" OOV OOV > Mr President , we have OOV yet another OOV in the peace process .
A great deal will OOV on the OOV OOV in OOV .
OOV the OOV , we must call for the new government - OOV the OOV may be - to continue the peace negotiations without OOV and to do so with OOV energy and , if possible , OOV these negotiations .
<P> It is a OOV OOV for the European Union to OOV OOV and importance during these OOV , given the current situation in the United States , where the new OOV has OOV not been fully OOV .
It is our OOV as the European Union to OOV our position in the peace OOV , in view of the OOV interests - OOV OOV - which are at OOV , in view of our OOV position OOV that region and in view of our important OOV trade relations .
<P> The most recent OOV of OOV and OOV must be OOV in any OOV .
The OOV for OOV of the OOV million OOV will OOV not make the peace OOV OOV , OOV will the OOV by the Palestinian authorities of OOV which , OOV of OOV the OOV of OOV , OOV the OOV of OOV and OOV , or OOV ' s OOV OOV in OOV , for that matter .
<P> OOV this , I would OOV the hope that peace and OOV in that region can as yet be OOV in the OOV OOV OOV , but I would OOV at the same time that it would be extremely OOV if the European Union had not OOV to this in a major way .
It is a OOV of our OOV at international level .
<SPEAKER OOV LANGUAGE="DE " OOV " > Mr President , I OOV last OOV with a OOV from the European Parliament OOV the situation on the OOV at the OOV points of the OOV OOV and the OOV OOV , OOV OOV . in OOV , OOV , OOV , OOV , OOV and in OOV OOV .
I am still OOV from the OOV .
I OOV there OOV OOV to be well OOV through OOV , OOV , OOV and Commission OOV as well as OOV OOV I had had OOV , but the OOV was OOV different .
The OOV conditions were OOV and OOV .
The situation was OOV to an OOV OOV .
The OOV of a state of OOV best OOV the situation .
The situation of the people in the OOV areas , particularly in the OOV OOV , some of which have OOV for over OOV years , can be OOV as OOV for human OOV .
OOV human rights OOV OOV OOV such as OOV , OOV or democracy , not even the rights to OOV from OOV OOV and OOV are OOV and OOV .
<P> In the country I come from , people OOV extremely OOV when it OOV to OOV OOV .
There , it is far OOV to OOV the OOV and OOV OOV by OOV , OOV with the OOV that Palestinian OOV are OOV into OOV .
But consider this : those who have OOV for over OOV years in a OOV OOV of OOV OOV , with OOV over OOV and OOV and no form of infrastructure , will have OOV OOV in negotiations , especially when these same negotiations have OOV on for OOV years now to no OOV , and not even OOV OOV are OOV .
<P> OOV , OOV of people are OOV by OOV OOV often enough .
We OOV this at first hand because our group OOV under OOV .
OOV no one was OOV .
What we OOV was an OOV OOV OOV by OOV people who are OOV of OOV OOV and for OOV OOV OOV the OOV .
They are there on both OOV , I might OOV , although there OOV to be more of them OOV the OOV OOV , many of OOV are still OOV new to the country .
<SPEAKER OOV LANGUAGE="ES " NAME=" OOV OOV OOV " > Mr President , we often use the OOV OOV ' as if we were OOV about a OOV OOV , such as an OOV .
OOV use the OOV OOV ' for OOV such as the OOV of OOV OOV OOV - which is certainly OOV towards OOV OOV - or for the situation in OOV is , in my view , OOV because , in both OOV , specific people are responsible .
<P> The OOV OOV that have OOV OOV OOV or OOV cannot be OOV with the situation of OOV and OOV OOV by the OOV at the OOV .
This situation was OOV OOV by specific and OOV people on OOV OOV on the OOV of the OOV in OOV .
I am a OOV of OOV and I am not an OOV of OOV .
I believe that the OOV by OOV OOV in OOV , which was OOV by the people who could have OOV it , and the OOV of Palestinian OOV since then , have OOV a OOV in Palestinian society which OOV it difficult for President OOV to OOV OOV - although OOV OOV - peace proposals which , had they been OOV OOV , would , in my view , have OOV to an agreement .
<P> OOV , a OOV issue , such as the right to OOV of the Palestinian OOV , could have been OOV by the Palestinian OOV to its own OOV as an issue OOV OOV OOV which had to be OOV with in OOV with the OOV Government on the OOV , of course , that that government agreed , in time , to Palestinian OOV that were OOV to OOV .
<P> It OOV to be OOV whether , on the international OOV , the new United States OOV will OOV more of an OOV approach than the OOV one .
However , I believe that the OOV of OOV has OOV that , for the OOV , United States OOV in the region will be less OOV .
OOV all OOV respect and OOV for our OOV OOV , I believe that this is an OOV reason for the European Union to make an even greater OOV to OOV OOV its role in the region .
<P> Finally , I would like to make a OOV of points .
OOV , OOV us hope that the OOV OOV , Mr OOV , is right to OOV that an agreement may be possible before OOV OOV - OOV - but OOV us not OOV that OOV is still OOV his OOV .
OOV , I have just OOV from a OOV by the European Parliament OOV for relations with the Palestinian OOV Council and I would like to OOV all of those who are able to do so to go to OOV , to go to OOV and the OOV OOV , to go there , to have OOV , to look people in the OOV and OOV .
OOV they would come to OOV better .
<SPEAKER OOV NAME=" OOV > Mr President , Members who have been OOV to this House have been OOV by people of Europe to OOV for Europe , to OOV what role Europe can OOV on the international OOV .
<P> I am OOV by the OOV of Mr OOV , the OOV of Mr OOV and the excellent OOV of Commissioner OOV of the situation on the OOV .
I was OOV to OOV in the OOV last OOV the OOV to which OOV is a military OOV .
OOV of Europe have no OOV of this .
It is OOV that there is a situation where the Palestinian OOV Council cannot even OOV .
<P> OOV of OOV like OOV were not able to OOV us to OOV that our OOV had OOV for us to see .
There is OOV on both OOV , of course there is .
What I am against is the OOV years of negotiations which have OOV to OOV , no OOV , no peace .
<P> OOV , I believe that we in the European Union should take a more OOV role : OOV - not to OOV the OOV in the peace process - but to support and give OOV to both OOV that we are a OOV , just , OOV OOV .
We should also support the United OOV and the OOV , because if OOV OOV are to be OOV by countries like OOV and OOV , then they must also be OOV by OOV and the OOV .
That is something that I hope Mr OOV and the Council will OOV on both OOV : if there are international OOV where there is international law , then both OOV should OOV by them .
<P> <SPEAKER OOV LANGUAGE="DE " NAME=" OOV " > Mr President , Mr OOV of the Council , OOV OOV , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , one OOV Member - he is no OOV present in the OOV - said today that he OOV the OOV is with the parties themselves " .
If that were to be the case , and it was OOV down to the OOV parties , then I ask OOV where is peace to be OOV ?
OOV have they OOV to OOV peace , and OOV it too ?
OOV I believe there is a need for OOV - and I would agree with all those who have made this point - especially with OOV European OOV .
OOV OOV , OOV , OOV and OOV to put the OOV under OOV OOV these OOV , have OOV the OOV hand .
I do not feel , as has been said here , that we can OOV to see the situation improve after the OOV in OOV , particularly if OOV OOV over , OOV in OOV what OOV under OOV OOV .
The point being that Mr OOV has done OOV OOV that could OOV us to OOV that he is OOV to agree a peace deal .
On the OOV , his road to OOV is OOV with various measures that OOV the OOV to be OOV .
<P> I OOV agree with Commissioner OOV .
OOV all OOV to OOV in OOV - with both parties , of course - and indeed , that is the only way to OOV a OOV role , we must make it OOV clear that we cannot OOV a situation where the resources we OOV in the OOV OOV cannot be used OOV because OOV , in particular , is OOV OOV under such OOV and OOV it OOV .
I have already come OOV this OOV OOV before in Parliament - the more OOV OOV to OOV OOV OOV ' s OOV , the more aid Europe will OOV , which means that OOV can OOV on financial OOV to the peace process to a certain OOV , and Europe OOV then has to OOV up the OOV .
This is OOV OOV .
<P> If we must OOV this financial OOV - and I , for one , OOV feel that we must - then OOV there must also be OOV political OOV .
OOV all the OOV , which OOV , I OOV OOV , I hope that the OOV OOV will OOV OOV OOV in his OOV , and that he will be able to OOV Europe ' s role .
If the OOV were to OOV from the process or OOV more in the OOV , clearly this would be Europe ' s OOV OOV to OOV a OOV political role in the OOV OOV .
<SPEAKER OOV LANGUAGE="FR" NAME=" OOV " > Mr President , the situation in the OOV OOV OOV OOV us with a OOV .
On the one hand , some of the OOV in the peace OOV believe that both parties have OOV been so OOV to OOV an agreement .
The OOV OOV also OOV to OOV this OOV point of view .
On the other hand , one of the OOV in the OOV OOV OOV the OOV peace process to be OOV in the OOV .
The fact is that we are , once again , at a OOV where the European Union should OOV out a OOV and a OOV .
I OOV my OOV to the Council and to the Commission .
The OOV should be that it will not be possible to not OOV a OOV and OOV OOV to the conflict between OOV and OOV without OOV to international law , such as that OOV down by the United OOV OOV Council OOV .
The OOV that OOV must OOV the OOV OOV , including OOV OOV , Palestinian OOV must have the right of OOV , OOV must have the right to OOV in peace within OOV and OOV OOV and OOV must have the right to their own OOV , OOV and OOV state , OOV international OOV are open and which is not under military OOV , are OOV OOV and all these rights must be OOV at the same time .
OOV is an OOV OOV and , as it were , part of the heritage of the OOV human OOV .
It must again become an open OOV again , to which OOV has OOV .
The world OOV , particularly the European Union , would not OOV the OOV OOV to be OOV , OOV OOV OOV at an OOV or at a OOV .
OOV these OOV , the OOV could be OOV OOV : that the European Union OOV OOV for an end to OOV and for OOV to go OOV but , at the same time , as OOV OOV and financial OOV , it will take the necessary action against any parties who believe they can OOV out of the OOV and OOV the OOV to find a OOV and OOV OOV that is OOV OOV .
<SPEAKER OOV LANGUAGE="SV" NAME=" OOV " > Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I should like just OOV to OOV following this very OOV debate on the important and difficult issue of the situation in the OOV OOV .
<P> The OOV OOV of the OOV from the OOV of the OOV Members is that the European Union must OOV a greater political role .
The major role we already OOV in terms of economic cooperation with this OOV region must be OOV by a greater political role .
<P> In all OOV , I should like to state that , right now , the European Union is OOV a greater political role than it has OOV done before .
OOV do I say this ?
OOV in OOV to Mr OOV .
I believe there is today a greater OOV than in the OOV for what Mr OOV OOV a OOV of policy OOV the OOV OOV .
OOV enough , there may still be OOV of OOV in the way this is OOV .
OOV , there is a very OOV common OOV , OOV by the presidency in its OOV with all the other Member States , to work together for a OOV OOV .
<P> I should like to say that , during the first OOV OOV of the Swedish Presidency of the European Union ' s Council , no issue has OOV the Swedish OOV OOV , as President of the Council , more than that of the situation in the OOV OOV .
OOV has there been any issue that has OOV the Swedish OOV OOV , as President of the OOV OOV Council , more than the situation in the OOV OOV .
I believe the same OOV to the OOV OOV , who can certainly OOV that question for OOV .
The European Union is , then , also OOV in the political process in the most OOV way possible , but we are still OOV the OOV results .
<P> I OOV the OOV OOV ' s , Mr OOV ' s , OOV OOV , but we have to OOV , of course , that what we are OOV with in the OOV OOV is a OOV very difficult political conflict .
If we are to be able to achieve any OOV of progress , it is OOV necessary for the European Union to be OOV OOV OOV , to OOV OOV with the United OOV and its OOV OOV and to OOV OOV with the United States , which has been OOV in its OOV to OOV this conflict .
If this OOV , then I believe our OOV may also be OOV with OOV results .
<SPEAKER OOV LANGUAGE="ES " NAME=" OOV " > Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I only wish to OOV certain issues , without OOV into a great OOV debate , since I do not believe that this is the OOV to do so OOV is it the OOV for us to all to start OOV problems that are not OOV .
OOV and gentlemen , some of you have OOV OOV the region .
I must OOV you that I have been OOV it since OOV , more or less OOV .
We have OOV an OOV OOV of OOV .
OOV of us who have OOV so much OOV want to OOV to OOV a OOV and OOV situation .
That is the OOV that those of us who are involved in OOV to find a OOV at the OOV wish to achieve .
<P> I would like to say that it is not OOV at the OOV to OOV for OOV OOV .
It would not be OOV to do so , but I OOV believe that the OOV of the problem have OOV been so well OOV and we are therefore in a better position to OOV towards a OOV .
OOV do I say this ?
We all know that , in order to find a OOV to this OOV serious problem , we must OOV the OOV and be OOV to OOV about it , we must OOV the security conditions and be OOV to OOV about them , we must OOV the future of OOV and be OOV to OOV it , and we must OOV the issue of OOV and be OOV to do so .
<P> For the first time the OOV or OOV most important OOV have now been OOV , and both OOV have OOV them as the important OOV to be OOV and OOV , and they have OOV to OOV them OOV and in OOV .
This is an OOV OOV forward .
The problem that OOV me to be less than OOV is that , OOV , time has not been well OOV .
If we had had a rather OOV OOV of political OOV , I OOV believe that we could be OOV at this time .
But now I am not so OOV because time OOV OOV on the OOV and political OOV and there is OOV we can do about it .
<P> But OOV who OOV to OOV , in this case with the European Union , must OOV the OOV of OOV OOV on the basis that there will be two OOV in the region , which are OOV of OOV the OOV OOV which I have mentioned : OOV , security , the OOV and the OOV .
<P> The European Union has OOV possible OOV to these OOV issues .
OOV do not OOV , ladies and gentlemen , that the people involved in the various OOV , in this case the Swedish Presidency , have not put forward OOV and OOV for making progress .
The problem is that the proposal does not always OOV OOV with the OOV OOV necessary at any particular OOV .
However , Mr OOV , with regard to OOV , you must believe me when I say that many OOV have been put forward .
These OOV cannot OOV OOV , they cannot OOV OOV a particular framework with which we are all OOV , and you have clearly OOV what this must be .
<P> I will also say that , with regard to the OOV , the European Union has taken a OOV and OOV position .
This position OOV that a policy of OOV such as the current one is not OOV .
We have said so , we will continue to say so and I can OOV you that , for my part , I will always OOV the current policy .
There will be no OOV OOV without a OOV also to this issue of the OOV .
We know this and OOV who has been involved in this OOV conflict OOV this .
<P> The concern which I do have and the OOV of the OOV OOV which I also feel is that , as some of you have said , the OOV OOV is OOV to OOV the political support of both OOV , which it had a few years OOV .
It is OOV that the OOV OOV - not peace - is not OOV as OOV and in the same way by all the parties as it was a few years OOV .
For some , it has not OOV the security that they OOV , and for OOV it has not OOV the change that they OOV and OOV in their OOV OOV .
OOV the OOV of some and the OOV of security of OOV .
OOV that , to a OOV OOV , OOV why the current debate is OOV such OOV .
<P> I would like to say that , on the part of the European Union , we will do OOV possible , with your support , and with the support of the OOV and OOV , to continue making progress , but it is OOV that there is a OOV to what all of us can do to OOV the process .
It is the parties OOV involved which have to OOV an agreement , and the OOV of us can only OOV to put in place the economic , social and political conditions for that agreement to be OOV .
<P> OOV own OOV over recent OOV has OOV me that the parties have OOV before OOV in such a OOV and OOV way and have OOV come so OOV to OOV the problems .
OOV that was my hope .
OOV , you are OOV right and it has been a OOV hope .
I would be extremely OOV if that were the case .
<SPEAKER OOV NAME=" OOV " > Mr President , I hope this will not OOV like an OOV after the excellent OOV that we have just OOV in OOV to the debate , but there is one point which has come up in a OOV debate and in two OOV this OOV that I would like to deal with once and for all .
<P> At least one of the OOV Members who made the point today is in the OOV and OOV I can deal with it now , for the OOV , and we can regard it as having been OOV out .
It is the question of OOV , which I know has been of concern to a number of OOV Members of the House .
<P> I want to make it clear that the Commission OOV any OOV to use the OOV system to OOV OOV or OOV .
It is OOV OOV that the main OOV of the Commission ' s OOV has always been to OOV a OOV of peace , OOV and human rights in the OOV OOV .
For example , in recent years we have OOV OOV OOV , OOV about EUR OOV million , to OOV OOV between OOV and Palestinian OOV .
<P> I want to make this point OOV clear .
The Commission has OOV OOV funds for the development of a new OOV OOV OOV for the OOV and OOV of OOV OOV .
The development of OOV OOV and the OOV of OOV are the responsibility of the Palestinian OOV for OOV OOV .
It was OOV in OOV with the OOV of Member States through OOV
OOV then the OOV has OOV the OOV of OOV the OOV OOV OOV systems - the OOV for the OOV OOV and the OOV for the OOV OOV - and of OOV a new OOV that OOV the needs of the new situation .
<P> OOV last year did the Palestinian OOV issue their own OOV for OOV OOV to OOV .
No OOV of OOV OOV has been OOV in these new OOV .
OOV used OOV to that were , I am OOV , the OOV OOV in OOV and OOV and were OOV by OOV for the OOV OOV and OOV OOV OOV at least - after they had been subject to some OOV OOV .
<P> I hope that has made clear the Commission ' s position on this issue .
The Commission has had OOV to do with OOV and we OOV any OOV of OOV particularly OOV young people and particularly through the education system .
It was OOV making the point at this OOV , because it has been OOV before .
<SPEAKER OOV NAME=" President " > OOV you very much , Commissioner OOV .
<P> The debate is OOV .
<P> The vote will take place OOV at OOV OOV
OOV OOV OOV OOV <SPEAKER OOV NAME=" President " > The next OOV is the debate on the following OOV OOV : <P> OOV by Mr OOV , on behalf of the Committee on OOV and OOV , to the Council , on the plan to OOV peace and OOV and OOV the State , OOV as OOV OOV ' .
<P> OOV by Mr OOV , on behalf of the Committee on OOV and OOV , to the Commission , on the plan to OOV peace and OOV and OOV the State , OOV as OOV OOV ' .
<SPEAKER OOV OOV " NAME=" OOV " > Mr President , I wish , first of all , to thank the Council and the Commission for the OOV they have OOV today to OOV an issue of such importance , current OOV and OOV as the situation in OOV , which the Committee on OOV and OOV is OOV and will continue to OOV with the OOV attention and concern .
<P> It has become clear that the European Union cannot only not OOV OOV to the current situation in that country , in the same way that it cannot - or rather must not - OOV OOV OOV on this issue .
We are all aware of the situation in OOV .
OOV , there is no OOV of OOV from the most OOV OOV OOV to the OOV OOV OOV and the real OOV of the conflict OOV , with serious OOV , OOV , of it OOV to the OOV of the region .
In this regard , I would OOV the concerns OOV by OOV at the OOV level of various OOV OOV countries at the meeting OOV on this issue in OOV OOV OOV , in the OOV of last year .
<P> The OOV OOV in the current situation is OOV OOV OOV ' , which was agreed in OOV OOV between OOV OOV and OOV , and it is OOV that the Council and the Commission OOV to their OOV and OOV themselves even more OOV from this agreement .
They must do so first of all because of its OOV military OOV , but also because it is not the result of any OOV process .
OOV , it has OOV OOV OOV both OOV and OOV the country , because it OOV OOV to OOV the OOV OOV of OOV OOV and , OOV , because it OOV the very OOV process that has already been OOV .
OOV , because this plan , which OOV on the OOV of OOV OOV and OOV ( by OOV OOV , particularly through the use of OOV and OOV OOV ) , not only OOV OOV ' s OOV OOV , but will also OOV the OOV of OOV people , who might even have to become OOV in OOV countries .
<P> We are OOV with the OOV by the OOV OOV Council of OOV OOV last year .
We OOV agree , in OOV , with its proposals and we OOV it as OOV OOV from OOV OOV ' .
In fact , we believe this to be the position of the OOV OOV of Member State OOV .
It is also OOV , however , that some are OOV to OOV a OOV approach into this Council OOV with regard to OOV OOV ' .
We therefore consider a OOV of the Community position to be OOV , which will OOV an OOV of it which we believe is OOV , even if this OOV OOV to the opinion of any of the Member State OOV , particularly from the only one that has OOV given a financial and political OOV to the plan .
As a matter of fact , I believe that the European Union , and the European Parliament itself , must not support an initiative that clearly OOV from a OOV agreement between the OOV Government and the OOV OOV .
I feel all the more OOV about this because I do not think it should be the European Union ' s OOV to OOV the OOV OOV from the OOV of third parties .
<P> OOV , as we OOV in the OOV for a resolution adopted by the Committee on OOV and OOV , and as we have OOV in a OOV resolution by this Parliament , our OOV is that any action by the European Union must be OOV by a OOV of its own which does not have a military OOV .
This is the OOV that I hope will OOV on the approach of European OOV towards the OOV Government on OOV OOV in OOV .
OOV , it is our view that this European Union OOV should start from the OOV that the OOV conflict that is OOV OOV is by no means OOV to the OOV problem OOV .
It actually OOV that problem by a long way and is OOV OOV in OOV , OOV political , economic and social OOV in the country .
That is why I feel that a OOV that OOV another form of OOV of OOV and , OOV , a different form of OOV OOV by OOV a process of agricultural OOV , is OOV and a matter of priority .
In fact , we also feel that the problem of OOV OOV and OOV OOV a OOV approach on the basis of OOV responsibility and international cooperation between the OOV countries and the OOV countries , which , in the first OOV , OOV OOV the OOV of OOV OOV by OOV .
<P> The European Union ' s OOV must also take account of the OOV importance of OOV an end to the OOV of the OOV OOV and the OOV with which they OOV , often in OOV with OOV military OOV .
These OOV are OOV responsible for the OOV OOV of OOV and even of OOV working with them .
<P> OOV the same OOV , the European Union cannot OOV OOV the OOV of OOV that OOV OOV as a result of the OOV and OOV of OOV OOV and OOV of the OOV Union , OOV OOV after their OOV in an OOV process .
In OOV , the European Union must fully OOV itself to a OOV peace process , which OOV OOV ' cannot be taken to be and which it even OOV .
We also need to continue to OOV with OOV and OOV this cooperation , which would OOV , as a matter of priority , an OOV OOV by the OOV Government to OOV OOV OOV and the OOV of OOV and their organisations in OOV the OOV problems that are OOV and OOV the country .
I hope that this is also the view of the Commission and the Council .
<SPEAKER OOV LANGUAGE="SV" NAME=" OOV " > Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , OOV me OOV by OOV the OOV Member , Mr OOV , for OOV his question to the Council and , in that way , OOV us the opportunity to OOV the important issue of how the European Union can best OOV to peace and OOV OOV in OOV .
OOV me also OOV by OOV that the specific situation in OOV and what the European Union may be able to do in that OOV were OOV which the Swedish Presidency had the opportunity to OOV OOV to OOV with President OOV during his OOV to OOV last OOV .
<P> The European Union is aware of the serious , OOV and OOV problems OOV by OOV .
We believe that an OOV OOV is OOV OOV if it is to be possible to OOV these problems .
<P> On OOV OOV , the European Union has OOV its OOV , as far as possible and in the most appropriate way , to support the efforts to get a peace process under way in OOV , OOV upon respect for human rights and OOV OOV .
In its OOV on OOV OOV of this year , the European Union OOV its OOV concern about the fact that the OOV conflict in OOV had become more serious and at the fact that the OOV of the OOV OOV had OOV .
The Union is OOV that the conflict can only be OOV by means of a OOV agreement and therefore OOV for the peace negotiations to be OOV .
<P> OOV OOV OOV when President OOV , here in the European Parliament , OOV for the OOV s help for his plan for peace , OOV and a OOV of state OOV , the Council has had the opportunity , in OOV to a number of OOV from OOV Members , to OOV the main OOV of the European Union ' s position on OOV and to OOV the European Parliament of the way in which the work on this important matter has OOV .
<P> At its meeting on OOV OOV of last year , the Council OOV its political support for the efforts to achieve peace that have been made by the OOV OOV OOV in OOV , as well as its OOV to OOV the international OOV in OOV OOV the OOV process - a process which , within the framework of OOV with civil society and with the agreement of all parties involved , should OOV to a peace OOV upon human rights , OOV law and OOV OOV .
<P> OOV the OOV of a OOV of the current peace efforts , the Council also OOV OOV of its OOV to OOV a OOV and OOV European programme for OOV and OOV aid to the peace process in OOV - a programme OOV at OOV and OOV respect for human rights , OOV law and OOV OOV , at OOV OOV conditions for the local OOV , at OOV the OOV of OOV and the OOV of OOV and at OOV the programme of OOV OOV in all areas which give OOV to the OOV conflict .
<P> At the second meeting with the support group for the peace process in OOV , OOV in OOV on OOV OOV last year , the Commission OOV that the Community ' s support for President OOV ' s peace efforts would OOV to EUR OOV million during the OOV OOV .
OOV EUR OOV million of these funds would be OOV to economic and social development and the OOV against OOV , OOV EUR OOV million to OOV OOV development and EUR OOV million to support for OOV of the OOV system and for the OOV of human rights .
<P> The Commission has also OOV that it is going to increase the OOV support OOV to OOV aid OOV through OOV .
The Member States are still OOV how much is to be set OOV for a European aid OOV for OOV , but the OOV have already OOV their OOV on this matter .
The Commission has OOV to OOV the efforts to set up an aid OOV of this OOV .
<P> OOV it OOV to the OOV against OOV - OOV under OOV OOV of Parliament ' s resolution of OOV OOV of last year , to which the OOV Member OOV - the European Union has also OOV the OOV importance of OOV this OOV which OOV OOV all European OOV and their citizens .
The EU has set up a OOV for OOV with OOV OOV and OOV countries on OOV issues , a OOV OOV action plan was OOV in OOV OOV and OOV OOV political support from OOV of State and Government at the OOV OOV OOV OOV OOV between the European Union and OOV OOV and OOV countries .
<P> OOV OOV the OOV to other OOV for OOV , OOV is also OOV by the OOV OOV of OOV , or OOV , and , since OOV , also by the OOV OOV OOV of OOV .
A number of OOV OOV were OOV in OOV between the European Union and the OOV countries and have now come into OOV .
<P> The Council has not OOV an opinion on the United States ' s contribution to OOV OOV , a OOV part of which is OOV to be used in the OOV against the OOV trade , because this is an issue OOV OOV relations between OOV and the United States .
<P> In OOV , I should like to OOV the OOV Member of the OOV - adopted as part of the OOV debate at the meeting of the OOV OOV Council on OOV and OOV OOV of this year - for OOV OOV OOV between the Community , OOV by the Commission , and the Member States in the area of OOV aid .
OOV , this will help us in the future to OOV an OOV approach to OOV such as that in OOV .
<SPEAKER OOV NAME=" OOV " > The EU has OOV both political and financial support to the peace initiative of President OOV of OOV .
We are well aware of the concerns that the military OOV of OOV OOV has OOV especially OOV OOV of civil society both in OOV and in Europe .
<P> The EU OOV about some OOV of OOV OOV are well OOV to President OOV and to his government .
The Commission does not OOV to take part in any initiative with a military OOV .
<P> In terms of the OOV against OOV we will continue to OOV to the OOV and OOV approach OOV by the United OOV OOV OOV OOV OOV on OOV of OOV OOV .
OOV in OOV last OOV the EU OOV the need not to put OOV development OOV at OOV by OOV OOV of OOV OOV OOV .
OOV this OOV we continue to OOV on positive measures such as OOV OOV , OOV new OOV , OOV market OOV in Europe and OOV the OOV of law .
<P> As OOV Members may know , the EU OOV last OOV to OOV a European support OOV for the peace process in OOV OOV OOV OOV should be OOV at the next OOV ' meeting .
This OOV of European support OOV OOV both from EU Member States and the EU itself .
OOV EU Member States OOV their OOV to provide financial OOV to this OOV and the OOV of them have already put forward their OOV .
<P> As the Swedish Presidency just OOV , EUR OOV million of OOV aid will be made available by the Commission over the OOV OOV .
These funds will be OOV to OOV OOV , OOV democracy and the OOV of law , respect for human rights , OOV the environment and OOV OOV OOV .
OOV will also be put on OOV a OOV of OOV problems in the country and , in particular , political , social and economic OOV .
<P> The Commission will also continue to provide OOV aid to OOV the all too many OOV people in OOV .
This OOV aid has OOV to EUR OOV million since OOV .
This year it is OOV that about EUR OOV million will be made available for these OOV of OOV .
<P> These areas of cooperation are also priority areas for the government .
The EU OOV to make its contribution OOV as OOV as possible .
For this reason a OOV including OOV OOV by the Commission and the Member States is at this OOV in OOV in order to OOV a OOV in an area OOV the OOV OOV , for which the Commission could OOV OOV EUR OOV million .
In this region , OOV is at its OOV level and the EU initiative will OOV the OOV of OOV between the parties in conflict .
This will OOV OOV implementation of the OOV of a peace OOV .
The OOV of these OOV ' OOV should be available by the end of OOV .
<P> OOV from our financial OOV , Europe is also OOV its political role in the conflict .
I shall OOV the OOV of OOV Member States in the Group of OOV which OOV the meeting area with the OOV OOV OOV agreed on OOV OOV as well as the meeting OOV by the presidency with the OOV OOV OOV of OOV in OOV on OOV OOV .
<P> OOV last OOV about the OOV of an OOV of the OOV conflict to OOV countries .
OOV have OOV their concerns , OOV OOV and OOV .
There has been , indeed , an OOV OOV of OOV OOV the OOV in the OOV areas .
For this reason the EU OOV the need for a regional approach to the OOV problem and more OOV to the OOV conflict .
This will be one of the major OOV of the next OOV Community meeting on OOV OOV for the second OOV of this year .
The OOV will be to put more OOV on an OOV OOV in order to OOV the OOV of the OOV of OOV OOV from one country to another .
<P> OOV up , we very much welcome this debate and we very much support the OOV OOV by Mr OOV .
<SPEAKER OOV NAME=" OOV " > Mr President , there is no OOV that the conflict which has been going on in OOV for more than OOV years cannot be OOV by military means .
We agree , Commissioner , that OOV can only OOV more OOV .
That is why the OOV Group OOV a positive view , not only of what OOV OOV the OOV OOV to put an end to the OOV and OOV in OOV , but also of the OOV efforts of President OOV to OOV OOV with the OOV OOV and his OOV OOV to deal with the problem at its OOV and OOV its OOV , because the OOV of this OOV are to OOV OOV which will OOV the economic and social OOV of OOV , the resolution of the OOV conflict with the OOV OOV , the OOV of the OOV OOV , social development and OOV the OOV against OOV OOV .
<P> In fact , OOV the OOV is not OOV to an end through OOV , OOV OOV workers are OOV OOV which will OOV them to OOV OOV OOV , OOV the serious problem of OOV people is OOV , OOV human rights are OOV , OOV the OOV on which the OOV of law is OOV are OOV and OOV is OOV to an end , OOV OOV OOV is OOV to an end , peace in OOV will be OOV more than a OOV .
<P> It therefore OOV to us to be OOV - and we are OOV about it - that the European Union should support President OOV ' s peace efforts in the way that the OOV of the Council has just OOV and also in the way that the Commission , through OOV OOV and OOV , had OOV OOV and which it has just OOV .
OOV to this aid , we are making a contribution to OOV the OOV of social OOV and to OOV the OOV conditions of the local OOV , as well as OOV the OOV OOV .
<P> It also OOV OOV to us that OOV s OOV OOV to the OOV OOV and that the time OOV for the peace OOV be OOV OOV the OOV which President OOV has just OOV , so that the peace OOV may continue and OOV a OOV OOV .
<P> But this is also why , since we are OOV to find peace and OOV for the people of OOV , we ask that President OOV OOV his OOV against the OOV and OOV OOV which OOV human rights and OOV OOV and OOV OOV the civil OOV , and we also ask OOV to OOV the United OOV OOV on human rights .
This is the only way , with the OOV OOV of all of us , with a OOV OOV and OOV OOV for peace , that it will be possible for hope to OOV to the people of OOV .
<SPEAKER OOV LANGUAGE="ES " NAME=" OOV OOV OOV OOV > Mr President , the OOV in OOV is a matter of great concern to Parliament .
We have already OOV a OOV of OOV in support of the peace process in recent years .
We hope for a OOV peace process , OOV on a OOV OOV the various parties to the conflict and civil society , including OOV , farmers ' organisations and local OOV .
That is quite different from a plan OOV to OOV OOV and OOV to OOV OOV with the main OOV involved in the peace process .
<P> Europe ' s OOV action in OOV OOV has OOV OOV when Europe has OOV its own OOV policy , OOV OOV and OOV its cooperation programmes with its own political OOV OOV human rights , democracy and social OOV .
It is OOV OOV OOV in OOV OOV OOV to the OOV OOV OOV .
On that OOV , the European Community as it then was OOV a regional OOV OOV of taking OOV in the OOV conflict .
The European Union must OOV this OOV approach and OOV it at international level .
<P> OOV this end , as I OOV it , the Council and the Commission are OOV to support an OOV OOV approach and to OOV against OOV .
However , the OOV against OOV OOV OOV OOV .
OOV , OOV with the United States ' military OOV is out of the question as far as we are concerned .
OOV OOV has to be OOV by a OOV with the OOV farmers , who must be OOV other OOV for development .
A OOV to OOV development is also OOV for : we are already aware that OOV OOV OOV OOV is OOV to the environment .
Government cooperation is OOV to OOV OOV of the OOV so as to OOV the farmers ' OOV and put an end to OOV OOV .
In OOV , a different plan is OOV , one OOV on OOV .
<P> As OOV Community cooperation , we are OOV concerned that the EUR OOV million of aid OOV may not be OOV to specific OOV to OOV OOV and OOV human rights .
We should like to OOV more OOV OOV these various funds .
In particular , we would like some OOV that OOV will OOV the OOV for which the funds are OOV and will therefore be involved in their management This would also OOV a OOV for the future of OOV and of this OOV OOV .
<P> OOV to the information available to me at present , there are OOV no OOV cooperation programmes OOV by the Commission in OOV .
If indeed there are some , I would like OOV on them .
What OOV of programmes are they ?
In OOV , we believe that the European Union must OOV its own policy in OOV .
This policy should OOV OOV peace , OOV , the OOV of OOV and OOV for OOV development .
No other OOV can OOV to peace , especially not OOV military OOV by the United States .
The OOV are certainly not OOV to this House , and after what I have OOV today , I OOV they are not OOV to the Council or to the Commission OOV .
I believe it is important to make this clear .
If we OOV in OOV up a OOV peace plan for OOV with the European Union OOV OOV , today will have been a good OOV .
<SPEAKER OOV OOV " OOV OOV OOV " > Mr President , the OOV of OOV is OOV under a OOV of OOV , OOV and OOV .
These three problems can only be OOV in OOV to one another .
OOV OOV OOV in OOV OOV .
OOV than OOV the OOV OOV less than two OOV a OOV .
The OOV is OOV .
OOV OOV of OOV own OOV % of the OOV .
<P> OOV farmers OOV on OOV OOV and OOV as their only means of OOV .
OOV OOV , OOV OOV and the OOV of state OOV give OOV OOV and OOV OOV OOV OOV to OOV their OOV OOV of OOV .
OOV OOV for OOV is OOV a OOV for OOV .
OOV OOV OOV , and human rights OOV are OOV .
<P> OOV to say , the world OOV problem must OOV be OOV at OOV level , that is to say also in the OOV countries themselves .
That is why it is OOV for farmers in OOV to be OOV a OOV OOV to OOV OOV .
This should also be the OOV point of the European contribution .
In OOV , Europe and OOV must , of course , also open up their OOV to OOV OOV from OOV .
<P> A OOV military approach will not OOV any OOV as long as the OOV OOV are not OOV .
So far , the OOV of OOV has OOV in serious environmental OOV and OOV OOV in people , as well as in a OOV of OOV .
However , we should at the same time not be OOV .
We need to OOV that a OOV approach is OOV OOV OOV the OOV OOV .
It is not always possible to OOV over OOV OOV by OOV OOV .
Europe should OOV OOV on the OOV .
The world must be set OOV from OOV and the OOV OOV from OOV and OOV .
<SPEAKER OOV LANGUAGE="FR" NAME=" OOV " > Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , OOV which OOV OOV are we OOV here ?
OOV it the first OOV which was OOV OOV to us , in OOV , from the United States before being OOV to the OOV OOV or the second OOV , OOV for Europe , which OOV the social OOV but certainly does OOV to OOV the OOV military OOV of the plan .
This programme of aid to the OOV Government OOV to OOV OOV OOV and OOV .
OOV is it going to do this ?
OOV OOV the OOV Government with OOV .
This military OOV is OOV going to be used to OOV OOV OOV .
You will OOV me if I am OOV OOV about the use of these OOV in a country which , since OOV , has been OOV by a OOV OOV OOV by OOV OOV that are OOV today , but which is OOV OOV a OOV between the OOV OOV and the people .
OOV who does OOV OOV see as the OOV OOV ?
OOV , it is the OOV State OOV OOV OOV .
In OOV , the OOV OOV are OOV by OOV OOV , who are in OOV OOV by the OOV OOV .
These are the OOV that are OOV OOV farmers , the OOV OOV , and OOV out the people OOV in areas OOV OOV by the OOV OOV .
That is without even OOV the OOV OOV on the OOV of the OOV OOV ' OOV who are OOV to OOV the OOV of these OOV OOV .
On the OOV of OOV OOV , a OOV is being OOV against the OOV OOV , .
This plan OOV OOV support to the OOV , by which I OOV the OOV OOV , that have already OOV over OOV people since the start of the year and OOV OOV OOV with the OOV are OOV .
OOV , on no account can the European Union OOV the OOV of democracy or OOV OOV at the OOV of this agreement between the OOV and OOV OOV .
The European Union and the Member States should not OOV with this plan ; they should OOV it , as do the OOV and local social OOV .
There is no question of OOV the responsibility with OOV .
OOV for what ?
OOV of OOV ?
OOV we OOV OOV OOV ?
I support the view of the Committee on OOV and OOV .
We shall , therefore , vote in favour of this resolution which , far from OOV OOV OOV , OOV quite the OOV approach , OOV OOV . to OOV OOV down OOV conflict , to OOV the OOV of the military and OOV OOV , to OOV respect for those working in OOV of human rights and to improve the OOV conditions of the OOV in OOV with social OOV , rather than against them .
OOV OOV is the way to achieve peace , not OOV OOV .
<SPEAKER OOV LANGUAGE="ES " NAME=" OOV OOV " > Mr President , although the whole of OOV OOV OOV from OOV which OOV OOV to OOV , OOV is where these OOV OOV are OOV in their OOV and most OOV form .
OOV , as a OOV and OOV of OOV , I can OOV you that a OOV of OOV OOV as the OOV of OOV ' has come into being in OOV .
<P> The European Union has made conflict OOV and the OOV and OOV resolution of OOV a OOV principle of its international role .
OOV OOV , OOV up between the United States and President OOV with no OOV by the OOV OOV , is OOV OOV to that principle .
OOV , I OOV OOV from the OOV OOV OOV in OOV OOV OOV a specific OOV I am OOV to OOV in this House .
A group of OOV OOV from OOV OOV , Europe and other OOV of the world OOV this OOV to make it quite clear that we should say no to OOV OOV and OOV to a OOV and OOV OOV to the conflict .
<P> OOV OOV the OOV between the European Union and OOV who have OOV .
OOV , the best way to OOV OOV OOV is to OOV the international OOV for the OOV and OOV of OOV OOV .
The best OOV to OOV is to OOV with OOV efforts to achieve democracy , OOV with and OOV the OOV OOV OOV to the OOV and to the state OOV .
The best OOV to OOV and OOV is to OOV OOV with social OOV to ensure rights for all .
The opportunity before us is there for all to see .
<SPEAKER OOV LANGUAGE="ES " NAME=" OOV OOV > Mr President , some OOV has OOV over the current OOV situation in OOV .
It might be OOV to OOV that just a few OOV after his OOV OOV - which OOV was the OOV and most OOV OOV by a OOV President in recent years - President OOV OOV with the OOV OOV of the OOV , the OOV and most OOV OOV group in the OOV .
It was the first time in OOV years of conflict that a OOV OOV OOV to OOV with the OOV of a OOV OOV on OOV OOV .
OOV OOV after his OOV , the OOV of the OOV , the second OOV OOV group in the country and OOV of civil society OOV an agreement in the OOV OOV of OOV .
OOV OOV were set up , and a OOV OOV the OOV of OOV was OOV under OOV OOV .
<P> OOV however , this whole OOV has been OOV by a OOV OOV of peace .
OOV , OOV , OOV , OOV , OOV and OOV by OOV and OOV OOV OOV have become more OOV than OOV .
<P> OOV with the OOV OOV of OOV the country is OOV this situation has given OOV to OOV OOV OOV resolution of the conflict .
What can the European Union do , OOV with such a situation ?
As OOV by the Commission and the Council , the only possible way forward is to support a specific European Union OOV OOV at OOV the OOV of OOV , respect for human rights , OOV development , OOV aid and social development .
<P> Commissioner , OOV of the Council , OOV me put it to you : do you really believe that at this OOV OOV OOV can OOV itself the OOV of OOV the aid and resources being OOV OOV to international OOV ?
OOV OOV is clearly OOV for .
It is also clear , Mr President , that OOV OOV OOV when it OOV OOV from OOV .
The European Union cannot and must not OOV into any OOV other than a OOV OOV to OOV OOV support for peace .
<P> For peace to be possible , three conditions must be OOV : OOV of OOV OOV , a OOV to the OOV OOV on the part of the OOV - President OOV has OOV an OOV for them to do so and we hope it will be OOV and a OOV OOV by the government to ensure that all the OOV in the peace process - every OOV one of them - OOV the OOV of peace , OOV with civil society .
Mr President , I am OOV that OOV , OOV , and OOV and OOV proposals are the way forward .
OOV all , good will is the OOV to a OOV to the OOV problem which the European Union is able to OOV , as the Council and Commission OOV have OOV here today .
<SPEAKER OOV NAME=" OOV " > Mr President , the European Union should OOV the OOV OOV trade and support a OOV peace process in OOV but it cannot , must not , should not , do so by OOV with OOV OOV .
This is a OOV OOV military OOV , OOV by the OOV , OOV OOV will OOV be to OOV the conflict , to OOV the OOV of human rights and at best OOV OOV OOV .
<P> OOV OOV of the OOV contribution to the OOV is military OOV ; only OOV % will OOV on human rights and only OOV % will be put towards OOV OOV people .
OOV OOV can OOV that this is a plan that will support the peace process is OOV when only OOV % of the OOV contribution is set OOV for this specific OOV .
<P> OOV OOV was not a OOV of OOV with civil society at a local , national or international level ; it was OOV OOV by the OOV OOV .
It has been the OOV of OOV in every sector of society , local OOV , OOV OOV OOV , the OOV OOV , OOV organisations .
OOV for it would therefore OOV the OOV and OOV the EU has OOV with its OOV and in its relations with local OOV .
<P> As for OOV OOV , what is OOV is no less than the use of OOV OOV .
The OOV OOV OOV used to OOV the OOV has been OOV to have OOV OOV in local people , to OOV OOV and OOV and it has been OOV to OOV the OOV system of OOV with OOV up to and including OOV .
OOV OOV , OOV OOV in this Parliament OOV this OOV , OOV that the OOV of OOV OOV of OOV OOV last year in OOV did not OOV OOV OOV of new OOV because the problem is one of no OOV for the OOV farmers .
<P> I welcome OOV , Mr OOV ' s OOV that European support will be OOV .
This Parliament must support his efforts with Swedish OOV OOV the OOV to OOV the peace process for all parties involved that was OOV in OOV OOV .
I am very OOV that he was OOV the Council and not Mr OOV , who OOV out before the start of the debate , and who so OOV OOV the EU when at the OOV meeting last OOV he made a OOV OOV in support of OOV OOV .
<P> I very much welcome Commissioner OOV ' s OOV OOV to have OOV to do with the military OOV .
That is what this Parliament OOV for , but he should OOV the Commission OOV OOV of OOV last year which OOV support for the plan .
<P> Mr OOV OOV there is OOV .
There is no OOV .
It is not an OOV of OOV OOV in President OOV and his OOV to OOV the peace process to point out at the same time that he has OOV so far to OOV the OOV OOV , to end the OOV by the OOV OOV or to OOV OOV OOV to human rights OOV , OOV of OOV have OOV their OOV in the last three years .
Mr OOV OOV OOV by OOV and OOV OOV .
OOV is right to do so but we do not give any OOV to the OOV , OOV OOV of human rights we OOV , when we say that over OOV % of human rights OOV are OOV by the OOV and the OOV .
<P> This OOV OOV is a plan for OOV not a plan for peace and OOV Europe OOV it OOV .
<SPEAKER OOV OOV " > Mr President , I would just like to OOV OOV that Mr OOV has said .
OOV OOV is OOV as a means of OOV of OOV OOV and OOV , but since OOV OOV and OOV OOV OOV OOV years OOV , the OOV OOV OOV have OOV OOV , which OOV that this is not an OOV OOV .
It does not work and it is also an OOV OOV .
<P> OOV the OOV OOV OOV in the OOV , OOV has OOV in a OOV way in OOV .
OOV to OOV OOV OOV of the OOV are OOV by the OOV OOV to OOV OOV farmers and OOV OOV .
The OOV Government OOV that it is OOV to OOV OOV but in fact it is OOV a OOV an OOV to it .
It OOV very well that there are clear OOV between the OOV and the OOV OOV .
If military OOV is OOV in OOV with what OOV OOV is OOV , it will clearly OOV the OOV .
It will increase the OOV ; it will increase the OOV ; it will increase the OOV OOV against OOV OOV people .
OOV plan which OOV a military OOV is not a OOV for OOV .
It just OOV the situation .
OOV Member States have a major problem with the military OOV and it is very OOV to say that we want to help the social area when clearly this plan is a military plan .
<SPEAKER OOV OOV " NAME=" OOV OOV OOV > Mr President , the European Union is OOV OOV that there are serious social problems OOV the OOV situation in OOV , OOV the need for the OOV OOV of OOV and OOV between the few who have OOV and the many who have OOV .
<P> OOV and OOV 's OOV OOV ' , which OOV military OOV for OOV OOV OOV , has the OOV of OOV this social OOV , just as the OOV , OOV OOV of the OOV OOV and OOV OOV , OOV it .
It is no OOV that OOV OOV is OOV with the government and is OOV of the OOV OOV and OOV .
It is no OOV , OOV the OOV are OOV OOV farmers and political and OOV OOV , that , under the OOV of OOV OOV OOV , OOV OOV OOV are OOV the OOV with OOV and OOV OOV farmers to OOV their OOV .
If the European Union OOV OOV in the OOV of its OOV and its recent OOV on OOV and human rights , it must support the social OOV of the OOV people and OOV OOV OOV ' , for it is a plan for OOV , not for peace .
<P> OOV and gentlemen of the European Union , if no OOV OOV of OOV is OOV out in OOV , even European Union aid will end up OOV the OOV of the OOV OOV , of the OOV OOV OOV and OOV .
This OOV is about the OOV of OOV and OOV social OOV .
<SPEAKER OOV OOV " NAME=" OOV > Mr President , as many Members have said , OOV on OOV OOV ' , this United States military plan , the European Union must OOV OOV and OOV , OOV a OOV OOV , OOV and OOV respect for human rights , OOV law and OOV OOV and , most OOV , OOV something to improve the OOV of OOV of the local OOV .
<P> On OOV OOV , including in recent OOV , we have OOV up OOV on human rights in OOV , OOV adopted in this OOV .
OOV then , I would like to take the opportunity OOV by this debate to OOV another OOV : since OOV OOV 2000 , three OOV citizens , OOV OOV by a OOV which OOV OOV OOV , have been in the OOV of the OOV OOV OOV .
OOV with these three OOV citizens , there are three other OOV and OOV of OOV .
OOV only have they been OOV OOV for OOV OOV , it has not been possible to OOV with them at all .
The OOV authorities are OOV OOV in their OOV but there is a certain OOV , even on the part of the OOV Government , to OOV serious negotiations with the OOV OOV OOV in order to OOV a OOV .
<P> OOV , I feel that we must make human rights our priority , and I would therefore like to take this opportunity to ask the President of Parliament to OOV a OOV to the OOV authorities OOV for respect for human rights and OOV the government to make every OOV to ensure , since it OOV that it is OOV with the OOV OOV and the other OOV , that any agreement OOV will , without OOV , OOV the OOV OOV of all the European and OOV citizens - both OOV and OOV - who are OOV of their OOV and are OOV of the OOV .
<SPEAKER OOV NAME=" President " > Mrs OOV , the OOV OOV OOV of your OOV OOV the OOV you wish the President of the European Parliament to OOV , and will OOV OOV of your OOV .
<SPEAKER OOV LANGUAGE="ES " OOV OOV " > Mr President , in my OOV as a Member of the European Parliament and OOV of my OOV , OOV OOV , and because of all it OOV for in the OOV country , I want to support a peace process in OOV .
I will not , however , support just any OOV of peace process but only one OOV , in the words of one of the OOV most OOV involved in OOV OOV , on respect for human rights and OOV at OOV OOV development and social OOV for OOV and the OOV region .
OOV a programme as OOV OOV as OOV OOV will not OOV the OOV , because it does not deal with their OOV .
OOV , it OOV us in the OOV position of having to OOV on funds to OOV the OOV of that very plan .
<P> OOV from my serious OOV about OOV such as OOV OOV , I am OOV to point out that parties such as OOV s OOV OOV and the OOV OOV OOV are OOV OOV in their OOV .
They are OOV forward an OOV approach here today , which is quite OOV to that OOV to OOV a OOV end to OOV .
However , on the other OOV of the OOV they OOV OOV the OOV approach .
<P> OOV OOV OOV OOV at least those who are OOV OOV in OOV OOV OOV them on European OOV - certainly OOV to be OOV the OOV as I say and not as I do ' approach .
<SPEAKER OOV LANGUAGE="DE " NAME=" OOV " > Mr President , the OOV we are having this OOV in OOV is OOV of the OOV of the Committee on OOV and OOV that OOV place back in OOV of last year .
There is OOV agreement as to the fact that OOV OOV and these OOV military OOV OOV a OOV to the peace negotiations now under way , and will OOV an OOV of the conflict in OOV after more than three OOV of civil OOV , over OOV OOV OOV , and when we had OOV that it would be possible to OOV in OOV once President OOV OOV OOV , and OOV the country ' s problems , OOV OOV . the conflict .
<P> The point has been made OOV today that the world OOV problem must be OOV at its OOV .
OOV I agree with this , but the problem of the conflict in OOV must also be OOV at the OOV , and Europe cannot OOV to make the same OOV as the OOV , by OOV that the OOV trade is at the OOV of the OOV OOV and conflict , and at the same time , OOV its OOV to the OOV social system and difficult political system in OOV .
<P> Commissioner , OOV of the Council , last OOV , Parliament OOV upon the Union to OOV an OOV OOV for OOV the OOV problem .
A OOV OOV , in OOV , the Council OOV that the Union OOV the peace OOV and also OOV to OOV the negotiations .
What we have OOV you say today OOV very OOV and I believe the Union must continue its work OOV these OOV .
It is OOV to believe that we can OOV the conflict in OOV by OOV military means in order to OOV the OOV trade , OOV OOV the social and political problems OOV this country , and it is also a OOV of the OOV people , who have already OOV so long for peace and OOV in their country .
<SPEAKER OOV LANGUAGE="DE " OOV " > Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , how many OOV has this Parliament OOV the OOV and OOV taking place in OOV ?
OOV many OOV have we adopted ?
That is why I was OOV to OOV the OOV of OOV the Council and the Commission made so OOV today .
But OOV who OOV that OOV OOV - OOV by the OOV with OOV , Mr OOV OOV take OOV - OOV another OOV in the OOV of peace , OOV to OOV once again on the fact that it will OOV the OOV and give OOV to the military conflict in OOV regions , in other OOV .
I do not OOV President OOV of OOV OOV to this plan or OOV it with OOV .
<P> The role of the European Union here must be to continue to support the peace process and OOV it forward , but also to OOV the government in OOV to OOV the OOV of law , which is OOV by its OOV .
There is no real OOV of OOV , there is OOV - we know all that is there - and it is not the OOV of the European Union - and I am very OOV to you for making this point - to OOV OOV to the OOV , but rather to OOV a positive and OOV role in this peace process .
That too is our OOV .
<SPEAKER OOV LANGUAGE="ES " NAME=" OOV OOV > Mr President , OOV to OOV OOV of the OOV of OOV and following the OOV OOV OOV against me , I should like to OOV to the OOV made by Mr OOV and Mr OOV .
<P> I think I made OOV quite clear , even OOV I always make every OOV to put my OOV forward as OOV as possible and with every OOV for my OOV .
I always OOV to OOV from OOV OOV .
Mr OOV , I OOV you to OOV me at which point in my OOV I OOV the military OOV of OOV OOV .
OOV do so .
At no time have OOV it and I wish to make it OOV clear that I am OOV OOV to it .
OOV , as Mrs OOV OOV , my political group OOV OOV this plan ' s military OOV .
<P> Mr OOV , I OOV my OOV and my OOV that President OOV OOV in the best of OOV .
If you feel he OOV in OOV OOV , you should have made that clear before Parliament ' s OOV OOV .
<SPEAKER OOV NAME=" OOV " > I only need to OOV to a few of the OOV .
OOV Mr OOV I would say , OOV to a OOV OOV OOV a year OOV , that the position of the Commission is the one I have OOV OOV .
We have our own plan .
We have our own OOV and we will OOV with all OOV of society in OOV to OOV the role of peace .
We do not need to OOV to OOV OOV .
What we are OOV OOV no part of it .
<P> OOV Mrs OOV I would OOV what the OOV is on an OOV basis and how we hope be able to OOV the EUR OOV million from the Commission : EUR OOV million to OOV in the OOV of social and economic development and OOV OOV .
This OOV a OOV of OOV OOV in the areas of health , education , development of agricultural and OOV OOV , and OOV fishing .
EUR OOV million in support of OOV development , EUR OOV million in support of OOV and OOV OOV and EUR OOV million in OOV to support the OOV and OOV of human rights .
<P> OOV and OOV this we are OOV a level of OOV EUR OOV million OOV year , part of which we OOV to be OOV OOV .
I mentioned the OOV OOV OOV OOV OOV OOV , so we have a clear OOV to continue OOV s OOV there .
We are OOV to OOV at the level we have been at in recent years as far as OOV OOV is concerned .
This has been at a level of EUR OOV million ; it could be a OOV more or a OOV less .
We have OOV OOV to EUR OOV million over recent years for programmes to OOV the environment and OOV OOV .
<P> OOV of these OOV will be OOV out in cooperation with or through different OOV .
It is OOV for us to do this if possible with OOV OOV and I will be OOV European OOV when they OOV in these OOV to find OOV in OOV as in other OOV and OOV OOV .
This will in fact OOV the OOV that we are OOV to get OOV .
OOV other OOV OOV to OOV the government to do what we think is right : to OOV more on OOV , to take more OOV the social OOV of these OOV .
OOV the government of OOV is the OOV we need in our OOV to OOV a OOV development there .
<P> It is not just an issue of whether or not we are OOV OOV .
This will OOV very much on the subject and OOV from case to case .
But the OOV and the OOV of a OOV civil society , which is part of the OOV and an OOV in the OOV , can only be OOV by a OOV OOV of OOV .
<SPEAKER OOV NAME=" President " > OOV you very much , Commissioner OOV .
<P> I have OOV the following OOV for OOV , OOV to OOV OOV ) of the OOV of OOV : <P> OOV by Mr OOV , on behalf of the Committee on OOV and OOV , on OOV OOV and support for the peace process in OOV ; <P> OOV by Mr OOV OOV and Mrs OOV , on behalf of the OOV Group , on support for the peace process in OOV .
<SPEAKER OOV OOV " NAME=" OOV " > Mr President , I wish to ask for OOV on two points .
OOV , is it in OOV with the OOV of OOV and OOV to OOV an OOV OOV for a resolution to a OOV OOV by a committee ?
This is an issue I wish to see OOV .
OOV , I wish to ask whether this second OOV for a resolution OOV or whether it has been OOV .
I would like clear information on this matter .
<SPEAKER OOV NAME=" President " > Mr OOV , OOV to the case law - OOV my use of the OOV - of this House , OOV OOV to the OOV OOV by a committee may be OOV .
This in no way OOV our OOV or OOV and the political OOV ' rights of initiative OOV OOV ; with regard to your second question , however , I am not in a position to give you an OOV at the present time , but OOV to the information available to the OOV , OOV has been OOV .
<SPEAKER OOV LANGUAGE="ES " NAME=" OOV OOV > I should like to say in OOV to Mr OOV ' s question that my political group is indeed OOV OOV that proposal so as to be in a position to support the OOV proposal by the Committee on OOV and OOV .
<SPEAKER OOV NAME=" President " > OOV you very much , Mr OOV , for that OOV .
<SPEAKER OOV NAME=" OOV " > Mr President , just for the OOV : it is my OOV that , after a OOV process of OOV between the OOV and the OOV , the OOV will be OOV their resolution .
If there is any change to that , this Parliament needs to be OOV far in OOV of OOV .
<P> OOV , to be OOV clear and not to OOV the debate , at no point did I OOV Mr OOV OOV President OOV of OOV OOV .
But in his OOV to OOV OOV of the OOV Government , I think he OOV we think that President OOV has OOV OOV .
We are not OOV that .
OOV has good OOV , but his government has not OOV the OOV .
<SPEAKER OOV NAME=" President " > Mr OOV , I am not going to OOV the debate on this issue .
<P> The debate is OOV .
<P> The vote will take place OOV at OOV OOV
<P> ( The OOV was OOV at OOV OOV and OOV at OOV OOV ) OOV OOV OOV transport <SPEAKER OOV NAME=" President " > The next OOV is the OOV debate on the following reports : <P> ( OOV ) by Mr OOV , on behalf of the European Parliament OOV to the OOV Committee , on the OOV OOV OOV by the OOV Committee for a European Parliament and Council directive OOV Council OOV OOV on the development of the Community 's OOV OOV - OOV OOV ; <P> ( OOV ) by Mr OOV , on behalf of the European Parliament OOV to the OOV Committee , on the OOV OOV OOV by the OOV Committee for a European Parliament and Council directive OOV OOV OOV on the OOV of OOV OOV OOV - OOV ) OOV and on the OOV OOV OOV by the OOV Committee for a European Parliament and Council directive on the OOV of OOV infrastructure OOV , the OOV of OOV for the use of OOV infrastructure and safety OOV OOV - OOV OOV .
<SPEAKER OOV LANGUAGE="DE " NAME=" OOV > Mr President , ladies and gentlemen - who I see are rather OOV on the OOV - following OOV , but OOV , negotiations between the OOV Council Presidency and OOV of the European Parliament , we , Parliament that is , OOV , on the OOV of OOV OOV , to make clear progress in the OOV OOV on the three OOV OOV on OOV OOV - OOV those OOV the further development of the OOV , the OOV of OOV OOV and the OOV of OOV infrastructure OOV - such progress being towards the further OOV of the OOV sector .
<P> I will OOV the progress made in three points , and I would like to welcome you Madam OOV .
We were able to get the Council ' s agreement on three points .
<P> OOV , it was agreed that all OOV OOV should OOV be OOV rights of OOV to the OOV rail OOV of all Member States for international OOV transport , by OOV at the OOV .
In so OOV , we OOV that from this point OOV , all Member States will be OOV not just to open the OOV OOV of the OOV new OOV rail OOV OOV , but also their OOV in its OOV , to the OOV OOV from the other EU States .
<P> OOV , the OOV OOV - OOV OOV by OOV - which would have OOV Member States to OOV the OOV European OOV OOV from the OOV national OOV OOV , has been OOV .
As I see it , this means that OOV the EU , the national OOV OOV or their OOV OOV will be the last OOV to be OOV with the OOV of OOV OOV , the OOV of OOV infrastructure OOV , or OOV infrastructure OOV , rather this will OOV to OOV of a OOV OOV OOV .
So these are the two OOV OOV : the OOV of all OOV for OOV OOV and the OOV of an OOV OOV OOV in all Member States , so as to OOV OOV OOV .
<P> OOV me just to say a few words about Mr OOV ' s report .
The third OOV OOV to be OOV in my view , is that we OOV , by means of a new OOV , to make a start on the OOV OOV of OOV the OOV OOV principle ' when it OOV to the OOV of OOV infrastructure OOV .
In this way , we have OOV that infrastructure OOV can be OOV in the long OOV with a view to OOV , so that the OOV , OOV and also development is OOV by the OOV , and not by the OOV OOV at the end of the OOV .
In other words , as I see it , we will still need , in the long OOV , to OOV the OOV of rail OOV OOV from those of infrastructure management .
But in any OOV , we need the OOV to be OOV by the OOV .
That is why we must make it our OOV OOV to OOV costs through OOV .
<P> As I see it , in taking these three OOV OOV , we are already OOV down the national , OOV OOV OOV and OOV new OOV for OOV between the OOV OOV .
Parliament has OOV for this , in OOV with the Commission .
The Commission was not OOV OOV to OOV with , but it OOV OOV us in the end , in a OOV to achieve this OOV , and I would therefore like to say a OOV thank you to the OOV for OOV cooperation in the OOV OOV .
<P> I believe that as a result , Parliament , together with the Council and the Commission , has OOV the framework for an OOV OOV sector , which will OOV a OOV OOV of OOV , OOV OOV services in the future .
OOV all , what we want is to OOV the OOV sector by means of OOV , so that , OOV , more OOV is OOV from road to rail .
This is because it is OOV OOV , on environmental OOV OOV , to get OOV OOV the OOV and OOV the OOV over long OOV .
<P> OOV , the course taken by the OOV OOV has again OOV out the importance of the OOV OOV , and we have only had OOV rights in the transport sector since the Treaty of OOV .
OOV the OOV OOV we would not have OOV to OOV down the Council ' s position .
If you OOV , the OOV OOV of the Council had OOV that following the first OOV of the Council ' s common position , all negotiations would come to an end , and we would have to OOV the situation .
But no , a OOV OOV OOV OOV us to make progress and achieve a OOV market , at least for OOV OOV OOV , with OOV from the year OOV at the OOV .
<P> OOV me just to look OOV for a OOV .
It is OOV not enough to only OOV OOV OOV , OOV and OOV , OOV is it enough just to have them OOV into national law .
OOV group OOV upon the OOV OOV OOV - and I see one is OOV up on the OOV , for which I am OOV - to take the necessary OOV now , so that they are in a position to make use of the new OOV when the European law that we are now in the process of OOV has to be OOV in the year OOV .
OOV , for example , the OOV OOV , OOV in OOV with the OOV national OOV or other OOV , should OOV OOV the opportunity to make OOV OOV OOV a OOV .
I believe this is where the OOV OOV must really OOV to the OOV of OOV through the OOV of the market that we have OOV .
<P> If , however , the OOV OOV do not OOV the new OOV OOV by OOV , then many OOV OOV will consider OOV OOV OOV with small OOV OOV , OOV European law .
They will be OOV to do so .
There are OOV OOV OOV OOV in OOV , and they are OOV to OOV OOV they wish , even if they have only OOV on a regional basis OOV .
I therefore believe we should OOV upon all parties concerned , the OOV OOV and industry , to take the necessary OOV measures without OOV , and make use of the OOV , so that more OOV can be OOV from road to rail .
<SPEAKER OOV LANGUAGE="DE " NAME=" OOV " > Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , OOV , it was a difficult OOV , but in the end it was a OOV OOV .
As with any OOV , there were people to OOV .
OOV there are also people who get in the way , but in this case I should like to OOV only those who OOV , in particular Commissioner OOV OOV , who , as transport OOV , was a very great help to us in OOV a good OOV .
I want to OOV this in particular , in OOV of OOV OOV work .
<P> The OOV transport OOV , too , who at first OOV OOV - OOV - to OOV us a OOV , in the end OOV a very good OOV with us .
I should also like to thank OOV OOV in particular , who OOV the OOV OOV very OOV and very OOV , and also our committee OOV , Mr OOV , who OOV us in OOV and OOV and OOV OOV in the OOV .
<P> I am also OOV it was a difficult OOV because it OOV a long time , OOV than it should have .
But since it is OOV being said that Parliament is so OOV and OOV and OOV OOV or other OOV are OOV , I should like to point out that we had the first OOV on OOV OOV OOV , but did not OOV the common position OOV OOV OOV , over a year OOV , and that OOV the OOV OOV on the OOV by Mr OOV and OOV .
But we then OOV OOV with the common position on OOV OOV and adopted the OOV OOV that same OOV .
OOV that , the Council again OOV a OOV long time to make its OOV .
<P> I should like to OOV that Parliament OOV OOV when it needs to , and especially when there is OOV cooperation as between OOV and Mr OOV .
It is the Council that always has great OOV in OOV a common position .
<P> So what does this OOV OOV OOV ?
I believe there are some very important OOV , OOV the specific OOV it OOV , but also the OOV OOV that OOV with them .
OOV , what I would call a OOV OOV , a OOV that is not OOV , that does not go OOV what OOV and OOV OOV think , but is OOV .
I , too , Mr OOV and a few OOV , would have OOV to have OOV something more .
We could have been OOV .
OOV that as it may , the first OOV have been taken and they should be OOV through , because I also believe that what we have in the OOV here can , should and , indeed , OOV to be put into OOV OOV than we have agreed , which for me is the OOV .
<P> OOV , OOV the OOV OOV .
It is OOV that , on the one hand , we said , for the OOV OOV - and following the Commission ' s example - that only OOV costs could be OOV for , in other words what an OOV OOV costs on a particular OOV .
But in the long OOV the OOV must be to OOV costs OOV .
OOV course , this means OOV costs not only on rail , but on the road as well .
OOV account must therefore also be taken of environmental costs , which - even if Mr OOV still does not quite believe it , he is already OOV OOV - are certainly OOV OOV for road than for rail .
<P> OOV , we have not OOV the OOV for OOV Member States .
It OOV , but we can OOV with it , and I think we shall get over it in time .
I shall , too , and I also thank you for your support in OOV a particular principle OOV , or OOV , OOV that , to a OOV OOV and where there is good reason for OOV so , public services can have priority , of course not to OOV the most important part of OOV , OOV OOV OOV , OOV OOV , which is the most important since that is what we particularly want to OOV from road to rail .
We have also OOV to get the OOV of the framework OOV for OOV to use the infrastructure set such that the OOV that OOV OOV make will really OOV OOV and actually be made .
<P> OOV , I believe it is a OOV OOV with good OOV .
You might say we can go OOV OOV OOV after the OOV .
We have all OOV our part .
But not so .
OOV things are most important .
OOV , the Commissioner has OOV us in as much as OOV has quite clearly OOV that further OOV will be OOV by the Commission .
As I said , I also hope that they will be OOV and OOV , which is very important .
<P> The second point , which is also quite important , is that , as I have already mentioned , we must OOV OOV at a system for OOV OOV costs , OOV OOV . they must be OOV for road and rail OOV by OOV .
That will do OOV with some of the OOV that still OOV , OOV the OOV OOV of rail as OOV to road .
OOV OOV will not be OOV over OOV .
So there is no need for OOV to be OOV .
But the OOV will and must OOV be given OOV and with it , OOV , the support that is in fact OOV the OOV of a situation that is OOV .
<P> But the question of OOV law and working OOV is also important .
OOV , too , the OOV is OOV .
OOV , too , the Commissioner has OOV , and the Council has already OOV in principle , to help us to put an end to the OOV OOV of OOV and OOV in the Member States of the European Union - a particularly common OOV by the OOV OOV OOV - in order to OOV at a OOV system in this particular field with regard to OOV law and working OOV , another area where the OOV are OOV OOV to the legal and especially the OOV OOV on the OOV .
<P> OOV course , there must be OOV in the OOV .
It is not enough to say OOV we now have a OOV system , but OOV OOV .
This OOV is necessary .
I say that especially because of the OOV enlargement .
If enlargement means having a OOV more OOV OOV on our OOV , there will be OOV .
If enlargement means we get a transport system that is a OOV OOV and also OOV to the environment , it will OOV with greater OOV .
That is how I OOV the OOV OOV that we are OOV today - that we get a transport system that is a OOV OOV to the environment and a OOV more just .
<SPEAKER OOV OOV NAME=" OOV " > Mr President , Mr OOV of the Commission , since OOV , when I was OOV to the European Parliament , I have OOV many a debate on the OOV problems OOV the European OOV and I OOV that many such OOV were also OOV before I was OOV .
<P> OOV the fact that we have OOV about the problem for years , I think that the OOV now being OOV as a result of the OOV between the European Parliament and the Council is OOV the first major OOV OOV towards the OOV of a OOV new , OOV rail transport OOV and towards much OOV OOV - much OOV in my view , Mr President , because this is how we can support the OOV of the European OOV , which have been on the OOV for years without our being able to do OOV OOV about it .
<P> OOV , OOV involved in this issue will want to give OOV where OOV is OOV , OOV OOV . to the European Parliament and , of course , the Commission , for the OOV reason that they have been OOV the Council for years to take the action which it has , I think , now been OOV to take - action which will certainly OOV European citizens , OOV , rail OOV and rail OOV OOV .
I OOV that when a OOV was OOV between the OOV OOV , the OOV Council OOV that it had come to the end of the OOV as far as the OOV of the OOV and the new OOV framework are concerned .
It is OOV , I think , that Parliament , with the Commission 's help , has OOV to change Council 's OOV , OOV us a far better OOV than the OOV OOV .
<P> I do not OOV to go into the OOV , because the two OOV , who know the subject OOV out and OOV I should like to OOV on the results of the OOV , have already done so ; I should OOV like to OOV how important the OOV on further OOV of rail transport is and to point out that , OOV OOV , there will be no OOV or OOV for the Member States - OOV OOV necessary because of the OOV of the Member States or their position on the OOV .
<P> I should like to OOV , Mr President , with a wish : that from now on the Council will OOV with greater OOV , that it will OOV to the OOV OOV on , that it will OOV European Parliament OOV not OOV to OOV the role of the European Parliament but so that OOV decisions can be taken , OOV than the OOV OOV an OOV which is the present OOV OOV of the OOV .
<SPEAKER OOV LANGUAGE="ES " OOV OOV " > Mr President , I should like to OOV by OOV all those who made the agreement we are OOV this OOV possible .
OOV the two OOV , Mr OOV and Mr OOV , then the OOV Presidency and OOV the Commission , more particularly the Commissioner , who is present this OOV .
OOV is to be OOV OOV other OOV because , OOV to OOV OOV on the OOV Committee , a number of OOV OOV were OOV OOV Parliament to OOV with the OOV of having OOV a specific OOV , OOV the OOV we are OOV today , and not with the OOV of having OOV a OOV over international OOV transport and national OOV transport .
OOV , it OOV the decision had been OOV for OOV OOV .
I therefore feel we are OOV a very positive and OOV OOV , in which we can OOV OOV such as that before us today .
OOV , the agreement OOV a OOV OOV forward in OOV with other OOV we are OOV involved in or are about to OOV on and are going through Parliament , such as enlargement and the OOV OOV of the OOV OOV .
<P> Mr President , this decision does indeed open up the OOV , and as OOV as it is OOV , its management and OOV will be within our OOV
We need not concern OOV about the OOV of OOV , because the OOV of OOV will OOV us to OOV forward .
That OOV OOV is important in the agreement .
We are of course OOV to the OOV , OOV to OOV them .
Mr OOV said that the OOV was for the OOV to OOV the OOV .
OOV , that is the OOV OOV , but at the OOV we need to OOV OOV and therefore we should not OOV things .
At the OOV , we need to OOV OOV for OOV OOV by OOV .
OOV OOV , OOV have not OOV a OOV way of OOV OOV .
OOV OOV OOV OOV OOV % OOV than OOV in the United States and we have not yet been able to make a OOV OOV .
We need to improve the OOV OOV , and the OOV themselves have to be OOV as OOV OOV the OOV of rail transport .
OOV must be OOV to find a OOV to OOV their OOV from the OOV to the OOV and once the OOV is OOV , from the OOV to the OOV .
<P> OOV this is OOV , we shall not OOV forward as we OOV .
We are all certainly aware that the proposals before us OOV a OOV OOV to the environment .
We must therefore OOV our OOV to all those who have made this agreement possible and OOV Parliament on its OOV .
<SPEAKER OOV NAME=" OOV > Mr President , Commissioner , the OOV OOV in the OOV OOV between Parliament and the Council on the development of rail transport is one of the most important results to have been OOV in the transport sector during the OOV and OOV OOV terms .
I would like , on behalf of my group , to thank the OOV , Mr OOV and Mr OOV , for their reports on the OOV OOV as well as the OOV Committee , for their excellent work , which can be OOV to be a OOV in this important issue .
<P> OOV group is in favour of OOV OOV in the OOV and OOV .
The OOV OOV between Parliament and the Council OOV in a OOV OOV that OOV the OOV of OOV rail transport could be OOV with OOV .
The development of rail transport will OOV on the OOV in the future , as the Commission is OOV a second OOV OOV to OOV further OOV and the OOV of safety .
I consider the safety OOV of OOV , as with other OOV of transport , to be particularly important .
The OOV of the best OOV that OOV safety , and its OOV OOV , must become a OOV point of OOV .
<P> The development of rail transport is OOV to OOV the problems of OOV OOV .
It will OOV the problem of both road and , OOV , OOV OOV OOV .
At the same time , however , we have to ensure that the OOV transport OOV also OOV to more OOV OOV and OOV regions .
As has been OOV here , environmental OOV also OOV OOV the development of the OOV .
In the future , we will have to OOV OOV how this OOV OOV will be OOV in OOV , and there must be further OOV in the OOV of the OOV we OOV from that .
OOV attention has to be OOV to the OOV of different OOV of transport as well as the OOV OOV of the OOV .
<SPEAKER OOV OOV " NAME=" OOV " > Mr President , Commissioner , OOV , OOV .
A great deal of work has been done , and as you know , the Group of the OOV OOV the development of rail transport OOV .
That OOV to both public transport and OOV .
OOV , we have had to take measures in order to OOV the development of rail , OOV OOV and OOV infrastructure by , OOV other things , OOV for OOV in this case .
<P> I would point out that we have a OOV , in view of some OOV of OOV OOV , OOV to OOV OOV safety and the social OOV which are OOV to OOV .
We are , to a certain OOV , in favour of OOV transport , but we are OOV in favour of OOV OOV transport .
I would like to make one OOV OOV , and that is that the environmental OOV of rail OOV to road transport are OOV OOV .
This can be put down to one OOV reason .
Parliament has taken decisions on the OOV I to OOV OOV and OOV OOV for a OOV OOV which is OOV being OOV , and it is now up to us to OOV improve the OOV OOV OOV and the energy OOV of rail transport .
OOV , the OOV which we mentioned a OOV OOV will no OOV OOV .
OOV has now OOV OOV OOV of this .
<P> OOV this OOV , I believe that it is OOV to say - we have OOV OOV and have OOV OOV in this OOV - that a great deal of OOV is still OOV , and I would now like to see the sector make a political OOV .
We have taken the political decision , but we now want to see the sector OOV us a OOV that it is about to OOV into further development .
<SPEAKER OOV OOV " NAME=" OOV " > Mr President , my group is OOV on OOV OOV OOV OOV in OOV OOV .
OOV , from the point of view of the environment , OOV OOV , safety and working conditions , we would like to see a great deal of OOV , which is OOV being OOV by road , OOV to rail .
This OOV can best be OOV by OOV OOV OOV OOV the EU Member States .
<P> This is why we OOV to the OOV made by the Council in OOV OOV at the end of the OOV Presidency .
These OOV OOV for through OOV OOV and for OOV OOV and OOV OOV in order to OOV possible OOV in good time .
OOV , the OOV of Parliament OOV that this OOV was OOV and that OOV , OOV and OOV should be OOV more to the OOV .
<P> This opinion OOV in with a OOV OOV which has OOV to a OOV OOV against public services , public OOV and OOV OOV , especially in the OOV of OOV services , rail and energy OOV .
OOV were OOV that could OOV to us that we can OOV our OOV in a more OOV , OOV and less OOV OOV , but that are now being OOV to OOV to the OOV of OOV and OOV .
<P> OOV of OOV consider rail as an OOV state OOV with OOV and OOV trade OOV .
But the OOV could OOV to OOV and conflict of interests and to new OOV without any OOV OOV .
OOV could , of course , OOV OOV OOV that can OOV more OOV and more OOV to OOV into OOV OOV , but that does not OOV a OOV in favour of more OOV OOV of transport .
OOV OOV could OOV , on the other hand , within OOV OOV OOV , for their OOV and for the OOV OOV with regard to their future transport policy .
<P> OOV , in this case my group was more on the OOV of the Council than the OOV of this Parliament .
OOV , if it had been up to my group , this OOV would not have taken place .
OOV this , I OOV part in it , taking the view that OOV OOV would OOV a positive OOV , and that it is also not a good OOV for the OOV OOV to be OOV .
<P> OOV I have OOV against the OOV OOV OOV for by Parliament on OOV OOV , I OOV on the OOV OOV to OOV a OOV .
OOV that was OOV , I OOV from OOV out of regard for this OOV , just as the OOV of my group will do OOV at the OOV vote .
The OOV of this OOV will OOV to more OOV than we OOV OOV , but less than OOV to be the case OOV .
OOV , I OOV that this OOV OOV will OOV be OOV by OOV OOV from the European Commission which go even further , and which my group will be OOV to OOV .
<SPEAKER OOV LANGUAGE="FR" NAME=" OOV " > Mr President , Madam OOV , ladies and gentlemen , a OOV OOV of the OOV was OOV necessary , particularly in order to OOV the current OOV which is , OOV , to do OOV by road , with , OOV , a OOV OOV on rail OOV services .
However , OOV this OOV , which is certainly used as a OOV , the OOV proposals in this report go far OOV what we were OOV for .
The only major issue here , OOV , is not the three , OOV or OOV years that it has taken to OOV this result .
For we still have one major concern and that is the OOV that some people have OOV to OOV the sector OOV .
This is OOV to us .
<P> We should be OOV , as this OOV of the transport of OOV will have an OOV OOV on both local OOV and social OOV , particularly if the OOV OOV no OOV has any respect for the OOV of a OOV rail OOV and the OOV of OOV a OOV for the OOV as a whole .
<P> OOV , an important , if not OOV , OOV for the OOV of the OOV of public OOV will be the OOV up of the OOV OOV market , which some see as part and OOV of the same process .
In OOV , will this OOV OOV of rail transport services have any OOV for the OOV of public OOV , rather like the case of the OOV OOV ?
I OOV not , as the principle of OOV will then OOV come to the OOV , a principle OOV OOV to that of public OOV .
<P> OOV and gentlemen , the same OOV to the OOV of safety .
OOV course , the infrastructure must be OOV and must be a matter for the authorities , but OOV cannot achieve a OOV and OOV OOV market without the OOV of OOV or a serious OOV which would OOV OOV that has been done .
<P> OOV OOV up , OOV we OOV the need for OOV OOV in order to give the rail industry the OOV it needs , we are still extremely concerned about this OOV OOV .
We hope to see OOV OOV made before OOV the next OOV , as we are aware there are other OOV which can and must be OOV .
<SPEAKER OOV LANGUAGE="DE " NAME=" OOV " > Mr President , it is to OOV OOV ' that we OOV OOV OOV of OOV .
For example OOV OOV has OOV ' is what we say when we OOV OOV .
OOV the same can be said of our OOV .
The OOV of three proposals for OOV OOV the OOV OOV , to which we will give our OOV OOV , is long OOV .
The OOV OOV of the OOV negotiations within the OOV Committee , has in fact come OOV years too OOV .
The OOV OOV this out , I am OOV to say .
There has been a OOV OOV in the OOV of OOV OOV by rail over the last few years , and there is every reason to believe that it will be very difficult to OOV the OOV in the OOV future .
<P> If we call to OOV that we OOV the OOV market for OOV in OOV , and the OOV market in OOV , then since this is now the year OOV , we are clearly going to OOV our OOV OOV , OOV to which , our OOV is OOV on a OOV OOV .
OOV a OOV of OOV for the OOV of the OOV rail OOV OOV certainly OOV OOV OOV , as does a OOV of OOV for national OOV OOV , but this is OOV OOV out the OOV OOV .
OOV you consider that the question of OOV OOV OOV OOV to the rail has not even been OOV OOV then clearly this is yet another area which will set us back .
<P> There are other , better OOV too , a OOV OOV as it were .
We must not OOV what has been OOV in the way of positive results .
OOV , for example , the OOV of OOV OOV authorities does at least give the OOV for more OOV , and we can only hope that the necessary OOV do not get OOV on the OOV .
The OOV OOV for certain Member States are , after a great deal of OOV and OOV - and not including the small country of OOV - only really for the OOV of the OOV OOV Member States , and at least the OOV for OOV the OOV and OOV transport is up and OOV .
OOV is the next OOV on the OOV , and we are OOV OOV the points for more OOV .
At some OOV it will be all systems go for Europe ' s rail OOV , and not just on Europe ' s OOV .
We must not OOV hope and with that in OOV I would like to say a OOV thank you to both OOV and to the Commissioner , OOV OOV efforts have already been mentioned today and for which they have OOV been OOV .
<SPEAKER OOV LANGUAGE="SV" NAME=" OOV OOV " > Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , Commissioner , there is OOV in this OOV of who the OOV in this OOV are .
In my view , it is the citizens of Europe who are the OOV .
OOV we have OOV OOV this OOV , we shall also have OOV to OOV a better environment in Europe , and in that way we are OOV all citizens .
<P> I see the environment as one important reason why we must get to OOV with the issues OOV to OOV .
We know , of course , that road transport is OOV at the OOV of rail transport and that it has been OOV so for a long time .
We must OOV that OOV .
It is also important that we should OOV OOV for OOV OOV of transport so that it is possible , over long OOV for example , to use both road and rail transport .
OOV problem , of course , has been the high rail OOV which have OOV OOV to more OOV OOV OOV .
The OOV ' OOV OOV is also at OOV .
I think we have OOV a good OOV we can OOV OOV OOV on , even if we might OOV wish it could have OOV further .
<P> OOV the OOV OOV OOV are concerned , I also think this is a good OOV .
In this way , it will be possible even for OOV OOV to OOV .
This is important in Europe , where OOV are long .
The OOV , who is to be OOV under the terms of the OOV and who is to OOV the system , is also an important OOV because it is important to OOV OOV in the OOV and in the OOV we have now OOV at .
<P> I think , then , that we have a good result and I want to thank OOV involved .
Finally , I hope that we can all make OOV that it is OOV into a OOV .
<SPEAKER OOV LANGUAGE="FR" NAME=" OOV OOV " > Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , the OOV of the OOV in Europe is OOV , and not before time .
It certainly is high time that we OOV Europe ' s OOV OOV and , more OOV , OOV resources to this OOV .
At last , we can be OOV , we can OOV the OOV of all citizens and believe that the OOV from road to rail is OOV .
The OOV on what is OOV the OOV OOV ' will have OOV us to OOV the OOV OOV .
At the OOV , we have to provide OOV OOV for OOV to OOV our OOV and be OOV as the means of transport that OOV the least OOV and OOV to OOV OOV OOV OOV .
<P> I shall continue to OOV you of the OOV OOV made by OOV OOV the OOV change that is , to a great OOV , OOV by road transport .
OOV are being OOV at a OOV OOV than OOV OOV are OOV in the OOV .
OOV we welcome the decision made at the OOV OOV to OOV a new OOV between OOV and OOV , the European Union should be far OOV in its infrastructure OOV .
In some OOV , the question still OOV as to whether it is better to OOV a new OOV rather than OOV rail .
I am OOV OOV about the OOV OOV OOV OOV , the OOV OOV OOV .
The European Union must OOV the way to ensure that rail OOV the OOV means of transport for all citizens as well as the OOV and even the only means of OOV OOV .
<SPEAKER OOV LANGUAGE="DE " NAME=" OOV > Mr President , Commissioner , what is positive about this OOV is that OOV to OOV OOV OOV will be OOV in the OOV future , which OOV OOV our OOV of being able to OOV OOV from the OOV to the OOV .
OOV OOV principle must be to OOV a OOV level OOV field on the OOV OOV , through OOV and by taking OOV OOV OOV into account .
But then there is more to OOV than a debate about OOV costs and OOV OOV , it is also about OOV for OOV , social OOV , OOV , quality and OOV .
OOV should a OOV OOV be a OOV any better at this than one under public OOV ?
We have a OOV to OOV what we OOV by general public services , and whether we think they can be OOV more OOV by OOV OOV OOV than OOV OOV , or less so .
<P> I believe that having OOV conditions of OOV for all will not OOV OOV in every case .
OOV OOV must make a OOV or OOV OOV their OOV .
OOV OOV OOV can , in fact , OOV OOV in areas where this is necessary for social OOV , on account of their OOV OOV .
It will not do for the OOV to be OOV by the OOV sector and the OOV to be OOV by society .
What we need is for the public and OOV OOV of services in a European OOV market to OOV an approach that is in the interests of the common good .
This will OOV OOV framework conditions .
OOV will OOV whether the OOV OOV of the European OOV will OOV better services for rail OOV .
<P> OOV Member States have already OOV more OOV OOV measures , with very OOV results .
OOV - I am OOV to have to say this gentlemen from the OOV OOV - is a OOV example of how not to go about it .
OOV of OOV have been OOV down OOV OOV at regional level , there have been OOV OOV OOV , OOV OOV OOV , OOV OOV OOV , and OOV OOV in OOV OOV .
This has OOV to do with OOV for services to the general public .
<SPEAKER OOV LANGUAGE="DE " NAME=" OOV " > Commissioner , Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , in common with the OOV OOV of Members of this House , I too believe that the OOV of the OOV OOV on the reports OOV the OOV OOV has OOV us to take a OOV OOV towards OOV up the market in international OOV transport .
The reports by Mr OOV and Mr OOV set the right OOV .
The OOV of rail OOV OOV from those of infrastructure management is OOV to the OOV of the European OOV .
I would like to OOV my OOV OOV to all concerned for the difficult , but OOV OOV , work OOV within the OOV Committee .
<P> As is OOV from all the other areas that have already OOV OOV , OOV has a positive OOV on the area concerned .
In OOV transport , the OOV are OOV and OOV for all to see .
If the European OOV can improve their OOV position OOV other OOV of transport , especially road transport , this will have a positive OOV on the environment and will also help OOV the serious problems OOV road transport .
<P> In order to achieve these OOV , and in fact this is OOV , OOV must not OOV at OOV national OOV .
It must be able to OOV on a OOV basis .
OOV in this way will the OOV become a real OOV .
Parliament has OOV a major OOV in OOV this OOV , all be it with OOV OOV .
The same conditions must OOV to OOV transport as OOV to OOV transport .
The problems OOV from the other OOV of transport - road transport for example - are not just OOV by OOV OOV OOV , but also by OOV transport , of course .
<P> The OOV will only be able to OOV back OOV in the transport market if it OOV a OOV OOV , and what that means these OOV is an international OOV , quality of OOV and OOV OOV .
If the OOV OOV itself this major OOV , it has OOV to OOV , and all of us with it .
<SPEAKER OOV LANGUAGE="ES " NAME=" OOV OOV > Mr President , Commissioner , if we OOV want to improve the environment and OOV OOV to take the OOV OOV our OOV European OOV , I believe we should OOV three OOV .
OOV , those responsible for OOV the infrastructure and OOV with OOV good use of the OOV must be OOV OOV from and OOV of OOV OOV and OOV .
OOV , the OOV must be OOV with other OOV of transport to achieve a OOV OOV to OOV OOV .
OOV , just as there are OOV OOV so certain OOV of the OOV OOV must be OOV of OOV .
The OOV of OOV a OOV of OOV should not be OOV .
OOV , if we really want to change the present situation , OOV up our OOV and achieve OOV environmental OOV , the OOV has to favour the OOV .
<SPEAKER OOV LANGUAGE="FR" OOV > Mr President , all of us here are aware that rail transport OOV an important role in the OOV development of human OOV , OOV of the environment and OOV local OOV .
That is why I believe that we cannot be OOV with the results of the OOV between the European Parliament and the Council .
This OOV OOV the OOV to open up the OOV and OOV OOV in rail transport services , for OOV and OOV OOV , in order to OOV the economic OOV of OOV , OOV of meeting the OOV of the OOV and OOV in this sector .
The report OOV the plan to OOV rail transport , and , more particularly , the plan to make infrastructure OOV OOV of the State .
If this is adopted , there is a OOV that rail safety will be OOV .
However , there could have been other OOV .
OOV if OOV and national OOV OOV , OOV of public rail transport services on a European level is not an OOV OOV .
OOV , that is what rail workers are OOV for .
We must OOV towards OOV public OOV services within the framework of a common policy OOV <P> ( The President OOV the OOV OOV ) <SPEAKER OOV NAME=" OOV " > Mr President , Mr OOV OOV in his OOV OOV that we have to OOV rail transport , to increase the OOV and OOV of OOV in order to OOV the OOV OOV of their OOV in the market in the last OOV years .
OOV OOV that OOV progress has been made by the Member States in OOV the OOV of the rail OOV OOV from those of infrastructure management and we do not see in most countries any OOV OOV of the rail market .
<P> In the United OOV OOV OOV could well be OOV to the OOV OOV government for OOV just that , a policy which has been OOV by the current OOV government .
However , last OOV the OOV OOV OOV OOV place in OOV , part of the OOV region which I OOV in this Parliament .
OOV people OOV their OOV and many were OOV OOV .
The OOV OOV place on a OOV with the OOV OOV at OOV OOV .
It OOV that the infrastructure authorities were aware of the OOV of the rail as OOV as OOV OOV and a further report was made in OOV of last year .
No OOV action was taken .
<P> The OOV transport OOV , OOV OOV , has OOV there will be no be no public OOV .
However , OOV OOV of OOV , the infrastructure OOV , and of OOV OOV OOV OOV OOV OOV as a result of this OOV .
<P> I OOV to the Commissioner , who I am OOV is aware of the OOV of this particular OOV , which I would point out is not OOV within the European Union , and I would hope that OOV would be able OOV to OOV on the OOV of the OOV .
In the United OOV there has been OOV on our OOV , there has been OOV OOV OOV in the rail system , OOV work has OOV OOV financial OOV and OOV has OOV a OOV in work on the OOV OOV OOV OOV OOV programme which is very much part of the OOV European rail system that we all support .
<P> I very much hope that the Commissioner may be able to give some support to the OOV authorities in the United OOV .
This is not OOV a OOV issue .
It has European OOV as far as the OOV OOV work is concerned .
It may well be that OOV support can be given through the OOV programme and I look forward to my OOV with the Commissioner on this extremely serious development .
<SPEAKER OOV LANGUAGE="ES " NAME=" OOV OOV > Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I should first like to OOV my OOV with the OOV OOV of the OOV , OOV with all or OOV all those who have already OOV .
It has to be made OOV clear that this initiative is OOV at OOV the rail OOV , OOV it and OOV it to the new state of OOV .
We are OOV that at the OOV of the OOV OOV rail will once again become what it was at the start of the OOV : a OOV , OOV , OOV and - for those OOV - OOV form of transport , OOV development , and indeed OOV OOV of OOV and OOV OOV .
<P> I believe we OOV a OOV OOV in that OOV on OOV OOV last year .
The decisions we are to OOV today OOV to improve the quality of the OOV .
OOV to the OOV OOV by some OOV Members , I believe that the problem with rail transport OOV is not whether it should be public or OOV , although it is OOV public .
The problem is that it does not work .
OOV us be clear about this .
There would certainly be OOV for OOV some of the measures put forward here if we were OOV with a rail OOV which OOV .
The OOV is that given the current situation , where a public OOV is OOV by public OOV with a OOV in the area of the Member States of the Union , it does not work .
It OOV does not work in the present situation of OOV and OOV national rail OOV .
What we are OOV to do is in fact to OOV a change - I would go so far as to say a OOV change - where the OOV are concerned .
<P> OOV and gentlemen , what we have OOV today through this debate and what I hope we will achieve OOV - I have no OOV that you will vote for the agreed OOV - is not OOV OOV up the OOV , but OOV up something new and different .
We are OOV up a European rail OOV which does not yet OOV , to OOV OOV national OOV OOV .
It is a OOV change , and we need to be aware of what we are OOV to achieve .
<P> OOV people have OOV that we OOV too much time on this , OOV that we OOV things .
I would like to say that we might well all have OOV to OOV forward OOV .
However , it is OOV to say that in the OOV time - just over a year - since I OOV over responsibility for this area , OOV progress has been made and the whole process has OOV .
OOV , the OOV OOV has OOV very well .
In particular , I would like to thank the whole Parliament for the work OOV , especially by Mr OOV and the OOV , Mr OOV and Mr OOV .
<P> OOV , I should also like to thank the OOV Presidency for its contribution at the time , and particular OOV are OOV to the OOV Presidency .
In that case , the OOV transport OOV was a OOV OOV OOV .
It was OOV that this would make it OOV for us to achieve our OOV .
On the OOV , it OOV us to OOV the point we find OOV at today .
<P> OOV have been OOV OOV enlargement .
OOV , this will result in the European rail OOV we are OOV OOV up being OOV OOV the current OOV of the Union as they are OOV .
<P> The OOV OOV are OOV up the whole OOV and OOV OOV , as Mr OOV has OOV OOV out .
However , there is also the OOV and OOV issue of OOV .
OOV of you , ladies and gentlemen , have OOV this issue .
The OOV OOV will OOV the matter of OOV OOV for infrastructure .
In this regard , the OOV of the OOV report are to be OOV in the OOV OOV , and I am OOV to Parliament for this .
I should OOV that in OOV to OOV what has already been OOV and will be OOV today and OOV , we are going to deal with road transport and the action we need to take for the future .
I must OOV Mr OOV that the measures he OOV to , OOV at OOV OOV OOV within road transport and between road transport and other OOV of transport have already been put forward or are about to be .
<P> In OOV , this year we OOV to present the directive on rail safety some OOV of Parliament were concerned about .
I OOV I can OOV on your support OOV the OOV of the directive on OOV .
OOV , we plan to OOV up a OOV OOV up national OOV transport and international OOV transport to the market , as I OOV when both of these OOV were being OOV .
The OOV should even be OOV before the end of the year .
However , in OOV to this OOV we plan to present a new directive , OOV OOV , to open up OOV to the national OOV OOV and international OOV transport .
OOV , there will be an OOV to OOV OOV OOV the OOV of the European OOV OOV system .
<P> As I said OOV , we will present a second rail transport OOV before the end of the year , and I hope it will be OOV OOV .
OOV is a OOV OOV , as is environmental OOV - both OOV the citizens OOV .
OOV , I should like to OOV with you some OOV OOV on some of the issues that have been OOV here .
<P> There has been OOV of OOV , because OOV is to take place .
It has been said that public services will not be OOV .
We must not OOV the issue , ladies and gentlemen .
What we are concerned with today is OOV up a OOV OOV and a OOV OOV to OOV , and OOV that OOV OOV European OOV may be OOV public or OOV .
<P> OOV , OOV is OOV about OOV of any OOV .
There is no question of OOV the OOV and especially not the infrastructure .
On the OOV , OOV in the infrastructure will be OOV for .
The situation is that in some countries not a OOV OOV has been OOV in infrastructure over the last OOV years .
OOV OOV will OOV that conditions be such that safety can be OOV .
This OOV not only to the OOV OOV but also to the OOV infrastructure .
OOV OOV my OOV OOV , public OOV is not , OOV , OOV OOV at present , which is OOV why we are OOV to improve it .
<P> A OOV OOV Mr OOV OOV said that two other issues had to be OOV with : OOV transport and OOV other OOV of transport with road transport .
This very OOV I OOV a OOV OOV from one of the OOV in the road OOV sector .
It OOV about the OOV OOV , OOV that it was too OOV .
This OOV of OOV is always OOV .
The situation we have to OOV with is OOV clear : a OOV % increase in OOV for OOV transport in the next OOV years .
OOV all of that OOV % should go to the OOV .
It has to be OOV by OOV of transport other than the OOV .
We must go on OOV OOV , quality of life , employment and the OOV of the citizens of the European Union .
This can be OOV through specific measures of this OOV .
It will , of course , have to be OOV by a OOV OOV of the various OOV of transport , of OOV OOV them , OOV , OOV , and OOV .
The end result will be a more OOV system which will OOV our OOV and our citizens .
OOV OOV OOV relations with certain OOV countries <SPEAKER OOV NAME=" President " > The next OOV is the debate on the report ( OOV ) by Mrs OOV OOV , on behalf of the Committee on OOV , OOV OOV , OOV and OOV , on the proposal for a Council OOV OOV " the implementation of OOV OOV cooperation and OOV relations between the EU and the OOV countries of OOV OOV , the OOV OOV and OOV " OOV ) OOV - OOV - OOV .
<SPEAKER OOV LANGUAGE="DE " NAME=" OOV , OOV " > Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , Commissioner and Members of the Commission , at this OOV OOV , I would like to use the OOV time available to me to give you a OOV OOV to the Commission proposal for a Council OOV OOV the implementation of OOV OOV cooperation and OOV relations between the EU and the OOV countries of OOV OOV , the OOV OOV and OOV , together with my report on it .
<P> OOV from the rather OOV OOV of the OOV , which OOV the OOV countries and which does not of course OOV all the OOV countries in the world , but only those with which we do not have any OOV areas , cooperation or OOV OOV , I would OOV like to thank the Commission for its proposal for a OOV .
As I see it , this is not the only area where it has done some OOV work , OOV in OOV all the difficult political OOV on this issue that have taken place in the Council , and also the cooperation with the European Parliament , which has OOV not always been OOV , no , it has done something OOV rather OOV in that is has actually OOV the many and OOV , OOV OOV OOV and programmes to be OOV in the OOV countries together in a OOV OOV OOV , OOV OOV a legal basis as well .
I would therefore like to take this opportunity to say a OOV thank you to the Commission for the excellent cooperation we have had .
<P> The Commission proposal for a Council OOV under OOV OOV to OOV a OOV legal and OOV framework to OOV OOV taken under the various OOV OOV OOV between the EU and the OOV OOV countries mentioned .
These OOV are OOV OOV from a number of different OOV OOV and some have to be OOV as OOV OOV or OOV OOV OOV to the OOV of a legal basis for the OOV OOV in question .
<P> In OOV this proposal for a OOV , the Commission has now OOV a legal basis .
In OOV the proposal , the Commission OOV to ensure that Member States OOV the OOV responsibility for OOV OOV .
Community action is OOV OOV to measures that OOV the OOV of the Member States and other EU public OOV , and - as we always put it so OOV - OOV OOV European OOV OOV .
<P> The proposal OOV for OOV reports to be made in future to the European Parliament and the Council .
We have OOV it OOV in OOV OOV and we have also OOV the OOV that the OOV is to OOV at the end of OOV OOV .
In OOV , I have OOV an OOV which I hope the Commission and Council will support , OOV the Commission to OOV a new proposal as OOV as the year OOV , in which it might like to OOV the OOV framework for a new trade policy and OOV .
This would also OOV the OOV that we are still OOV , OOV the fact that we have no positive OOV of trade policy OOV in our Treaty .
OOV we only OOV it in a OOV way by OOV what it does not OOV .
I would be OOV if the Commission could use this positive OOV in future .
<P> I believe the OOV OOV OOV itself extremely well to this , and in this OOV I would also ask the Commission to always OOV in OOV that Parliament is not OOV with the current OOV of OOV OOV .
This should come as no OOV to you , Commissioner OOV , rather I OOV that , OOV , you are OOV with Parliament ' s view of the matter .
OOV , I would also be OOV if you would OOV your position in this new OOV , OOV OOV . your position in OOV to one of the countries , OOV the United States , which you have now set out - indeed you have OOV a very OOV OOV of our relations with the United States .
I would also like the OOV that are OOV taking place within the Commission , especially on the part of Commissioner OOV - who would like a policy OOV to be OOV in the OOV of trade policy at some OOV - to be OOV in a OOV in the year OOV .
<P> The OOV , which are now to be OOV in OOV terms under this OOV OOV , OOV cooperation OOV , OOV OOV programmes and programmes for OOV trade relations .
These OOV the OOV programmes OOV the United States , and especially those set up with OOV .
<P> On a OOV OOV , I would like to say another OOV thank you for all the OOV OOV you have OOV out in OOV to the various countries .
It would be OOV if you could OOV OOV from this , and OOV what you think could be OOV on to programmes with other countries , what , in your opinion , may not have OOV as OOV or what you think does not OOV a OOV of OOV the OOV OOV .
If you OOV out this OOV , then as I see it , we will have an excellent OOV on which to OOV a real trade policy and OOV .
In the OOV of OOV and the next world trade OOV , you will then have OOV an excellent basis to my OOV .
OOV again , I would like to thank you OOV for this .
<SPEAKER OOV LANGUAGE="ES " NAME=" OOV " > Mr President , a number of OOV OOV OOV have OOV OOV when OOV Community action OOV cooperation and trade relations within the framework of the various OOV OOV OOV by the European Union and OOV third countries .
OOV , the OOV OOV OOV by European OOV call for a more clearly OOV legal framework and for a OOV OOV OOV .
It would then be possible to OOV these OOV in a more OOV and OOV OOV and OOV OOV OOV to the OOV OOV by the Member States .
<P> The OOV put forward by the Commission is therefore very OOV , and Mrs OOV s excellent report is even more so .
On behalf of my group I would like to OOV Mrs OOV on OOV work , OOV to which , the Commission ' s proposal is now much more OOV and OOV .
OOV group also OOV a number of amendments to this proposal .
These were OOV OOV at making OOV OOV more OOV by OOV the European Parliament in the OOV and OOV of the various OOV to be OOV in the OOV countries .
OOV amendments were also OOV to ensure greater OOV for the OOV of those involved , both the European Union and the OOV countries , in OOV with programmes OOV cooperation and OOV relations .
In particular , my group has OOV the Commission to OOV the OOV OOV after decisions have been taken OOV OOV of the OOV of the OOV of the various programmes and the OOV for OOV to OOV .
As we see it , this is the only way to improve OOV and OOV to these programmes by European citizens and OOV .
<P> OOV , I should like to OOV with OOV to the fact that Parliament was OOV to OOV this report - the OOV report - at last OOV ' s OOV .
OOV the report been adopted the programme could have OOV into OOV OOV , as OOV .
OOV us hope that it will , OOV , OOV its OOV .
<SPEAKER OOV LANGUAGE="DE " NAME=" OOV , OOV " > Mr President , it is OOV OOV to OOV OOV at such a OOV OOV , but when you have a report like this in your hand , you could OOV them at any time of OOV .
I think Mrs OOV has OOV an OOV OOV OOV of work .
I would like to OOV once more on two particular points .
OOV is the issue of OOV and the other is the problem of a trade OOV which still OOV .
<P> On the matter of OOV , I would OOV the Commission , in particular , to OOV its OOV OOV OOV OOV OOV to OOV .
I think that is OOV the OOV we should be taking , in other words , not only should Parliament be OOV OOV OOV , but since so much has been made of OOV under the European OOV initiative , a fully OOV OOV of OOV should also be made available on the OOV , so that they can be OOV up any time , and can , in their OOV , help OOV the OOV of what we all OOV for , OOV the development of a new Europe .
<P> What is extremely OOV - and you certainly cannot say that of every report - is the OOV part that has been OOV .
This OOV me to the second issue , that of the OOV OOV of trade policy .
It certainly has not become any OOV to get the OOV OOV that what trade means to us , when it is OOV OOV , is OOV OOV , OOV I might OOV .
OOV OOV and OOV , we have OOV OOV aware that we are OOV with OOV OOV of OOV .
It is all a matter of having the right rules .
What it OOV down to is OOV , and to some OOV , to information too .
If only all those who do not have a good OOV to say about OOV could OOV , for example , how OOV Europe has already become in the OOV of OOV OOV OOV , as is OOV from this report , or indeed in all OOV of other areas .
What we need to do is set about OOV them .
It is to be OOV that the Commission , in particular , will OOV get to OOV with these OOV issues , so that we can OOV OOV programmes OOV out the OOV OOV , well in OOV of OOV and use them to OOV the public over .
<SPEAKER OOV NAME=" OOV " > Mr President , I would like to thank Mrs OOV for OOV work , but OOV has OOV to make a OOV OOV report out of what is a rather political issue .
In fact , the question of trade and trade relations between the EU and the OOV countries , particularly the OOV , is a very OOV OOV .
So it is a OOV that OOV OOV the opportunity to OOV it in a more political way .
However , the proposal to OOV a OOV OOV OOV could OOV the work of the European Parliament as a whole and increase OOV .
I do not therefore have a problem with OOV OOV proposals OOV indeed the Commission ' s proposals .
<P> It is a OOV , however , that we OOV to OOV whether we OOV more OOV OOV and , if so , what for , and to go into this whole question in more OOV .
OOV OOV used the opportunity to OOV a rather OOV framework on trade which is OOV own rather than OOV OOV ' s . <P> OOV also OOV to deal with issues such as OOV with development issues and the very OOV trade OOV that we had .
But once again OOV the work of Parliament and the Commission is to be OOV and therefore we will not be OOV this report .
<SPEAKER OOV LANGUAGE="DE " NAME=" OOV > Mr President , Commissioner , I OOV in my OOV as OOV of the OOV OOV and welcome the new OOV OOV , which at last OOV a OOV legal basis , all be it one which will OOV only OOV to the year OOV , for the OOV on OOV cooperation and trade relations .
OOV , I would like to OOV Mrs OOV s OOV of the Commissioner for the excellent cooperation we have had , but I would especially like to OOV the group of OOV present here today in OOV your work , Mrs OOV , because it was no OOV OOV and I know it has been a OOV OOV , OOV the Commission , the Member States and Parliament .
We must OOV to find a OOV basis , because we will only make progress in this matter if we work together .
<P> I believe that we have , in this new OOV OOV , a OOV basis for a political and economic debate with the OOV OOV .
That is why I do not want to OOV it to trade OOV .
I believe it is important to achieve a OOV OOV with the OOV countries of OOV OOV , the OOV OOV and OOV , and to OOV up our OOV OOV .
This is necessary if we are to OOV OOV to people OOV including OOV - the OOV of OOV .
I believe there are still some OOV OOV in this respect .
There are some excellent programmes when it OOV to OOV .
I believe the OOV OOV OOV in OOV is OOV and could be adopted OOV , indeed there is now a OOV OOV in OOV which is in its OOV OOV .
The OOV to OOV OOV is also OOV as a trade OOV OOV .
OOV OOV countries could OOV it .
OOV , I believe we OOV should consider taking our example from the relations between the OOV OOV , the OOV OOV for example , and OOV , because OOV between the European Parliament and OOV is not OOV OOV enough yet .
<P> I therefore believe we should OOV on this example , in a OOV to OOV OOV relations between the two OOV of the OOV OOV and the European Parliament , and just as the OOV do , working from a legal basis , so should we use the same OOV with regard to OOV .
<P> OOV me to OOV with a OOV OOV .
OOV OOV we have adopted this OOV of OOV of responsibility , OOV for OOV of OOV , on account of the different legal basis , we should be aware , OOV , that we have very different OOV of working .
OOV for example my area , OOV , which OOV me extremely OOV .
I believe we should OOV the OOV OOV much more OOV in political and OOV terms .
OOV OOV we must be OOV to do is OOV a OOV for OOV before the next OOV meeting .
So OOV as to what the legal situation is , Europe and OOV must OOV OOV together .
<SPEAKER OOV NAME=" OOV " > Mr President , I want to OOV Mrs OOV on OOV OOV OOV work and have great OOV in OOV it .
The importance , as Mrs OOV has OOV and the Commission OOV , of a OOV OOV OOV , is not just about OOV Parliament ' s work .
It is so that we can OOV OOV and vote on what OOV we are OOV on which OOV so that the Commission and Parliament can OOV consider what is best OOV for OOV and how we need to OOV OOV in the future .
<P> The OOV Mrs OOV has given to the importance of OOV about the OOV of responsibility between the Community and the Member States in the field of OOV OOV is also OOV .
There is some OOV about this and OOV about the OOV OOV and the legal OOV are not only going to help us to do our work in a more OOV way but also OOV the Member States that there is a OOV OOV of OOV .
<P> I want to OOV very OOV on two other OOV .
I was very OOV as President of the OOV between this Parliament and the OOV OOV that the OOV OOV ' OOV OOV a OOV in the OOV report .
You know , OOV , how much OOV this Parliament has put on the OOV
OOV Mrs OOV s report mentioned , OOV the many other excellent OOV , the European OOV in OOV OOV by the Commission .
It is just one example , but an excellent one , of how cooperation , not only financial but political , OOV and OOV , can OOV very OOV OOV .
<P> I am OOV to support Mrs OOV and as I am OOV my OOV with one second to OOV , I hope I will OOV a OOV of OOV for that .
<P> <SPEAKER OOV OOV > Mr President , Commissioner OOV , I too this time must OOV from my OOV OOV and OOV my OOV , Mrs OOV , for OOV certainly OOV it .
In these OOV OOV I have been a Member of the European Parliament , I have become OOV with the fact that Mrs OOV is well OOV in a number of areas and particularly OOV relations ; and this report is an OOV of that also .
I OOV with Mrs OOV , who OOV to have OOV the OOV already , that the report is not OOV political .
There are actually very political OOV OOV , for example , in the OOV OOV , which I , at least , OOV OOV .
OOV course , the OOV is not one of OOV OOV .
<P> I OOV support the OOV programme of measures to make the general OOV policy of the EU and its Member States more OOV .
OOV cooperation might even be OOV as an OOV when we take into account the amendments made at OOV to OOV OOV and those many OOV which were made during the OOV at OOV in favour of a OOV that would also go much further .
I agree with the rapporteur , too , that the OOV OOV should OOV OOV a new approach to the OOV s OOV policy .
The rapporteur ' s opinion on the OOV of OOV is also to be OOV , and especially OOV opinion OOV a OOV common OOV policy , which concerns my own committee in particular - the Committee on OOV and OOV OOV .
The OOV set for the Commission to OOV proposals to Parliament must also OOV our support , as too should the use of the OOV ' OOV in this OOV .
These OOV set should not , however , OOV that the Commission should not have an OOV OOV to OOV Parliament up to OOV on the progress of the action programme .
<P> OOV all the OOV OOV by the proposal I would in particular like to OOV the importance of cooperation OOV with the United States of OOV .
For example , OOV , the OOV OOV OOV , has , as far as I can see , OOV well and OOV in OOV trade OOV and OOV about OOV OOV in areas OOV a OOV OOV .
A good example is the OOV OOV OOV OOV last OOV .
OOV trade is still the OOV of life as far as the OOV OOV is concerned , and the importance of cooperation in this area must not be OOV .
We have to OOV that there is also a OOV political OOV OOV with this cooperation , the basis for which was OOV in OOV with the OOV of the OOV OOV OOV .
OOV , Parliament OOV to be involved in this work and has therefore OOV to OOV its OOV with the OOV OOV in the OOV of the OOV OOV that my OOV , Mrs OOV , also mentioned OOV .
<SPEAKER OOV NAME=" OOV " > Mr President , I have taken part OOV in the OOV in two OOV on the OOV OOV and the Mediterranean and now we OOV on to OOV OOV OOV , OOV , but a very important subject indeed .
<P> OOV me OOV first by OOV Parliament for the support that it has given to this Commission proposal , OOV by OOV a OOV for the implementation of this OOV in OOV with the Commission ' s OOV for OOV of EUR OOV million .
We are extremely OOV to Parliament for that .
<P> OOV , I would like to thank Parliament for OOV OOV , as I hope it will , the OOV report from the rapporteur , OOV OOV .
I take this is as a OOV OOV of Parliament ' s OOV OOV of the Commission ' s proposal OOV the OOV countries .
At this OOV may I OOV our OOV OOV to OOV OOV , and indeed to OOV OOV OOV OOV , for their OOV , OOV support for the development of our OOV OOV .
OOV I am OOV the United States , OOV , OOV and OOV during the course of the next three OOV , I am very OOV that we have made this progress this OOV .
<P> OOV relations with the OOV countries have OOV OOV , and indeed OOV , in recent years .
We are OOV OOV from a OOV OOV on trade to OOV OOV OOV OOV from the OOV OOV and OOV OOV , OOV and OOV OOV , education and OOV , environmental issues , OOV and OOV and , which I regard as particularly important , OOV OOV .
<P> In the case of the United States and OOV , these OOV OOV are already a OOV , OOV other OOV like OOV , the OOV of OOV , OOV OOV and OOV are OOV to OOV OOV OOV .
The OOV of these OOV are the common OOV and the OOV interests that we OOV .
<P> So OOV we see on the one hand an OOV OOV for OOV cooperation with some of our most important OOV , on the other , we have OOV the legal framework to be able to OOV things up .
OOV , we OOV only have legal OOV for OOV with OOV and OOV .
The OOV is OOV to market OOV OOV and it OOV at the end of this year .
For the United States , we do not have a legal basis at all , OOV us to OOV OOV under the new OOV OOV as OOV OOV or OOV OOV which do not OOV a legal OOV but which are OOV in time to OOV two or three years .
<P> The Commission proposal under OOV OOV to OOV this situation by OOV a OOV and common legal OOV which can OOV our relations with the OOV countries .
A common legal OOV is appropriate since our relations with all these countries are OOV on common OOV and OOV interests .
It is also appropriate because it would OOV the Commission to OOV OOV programmes to the OOV possible with all or some of these countries .
In OOV , if OOV to a OOV OOV OOV as we have OOV , we would have clear OOV OOV .
We would OOV improve OOV by OOV for OOV of OOV and OOV OOV OOV .
OOV OOV OOV both for Parliament , and I must say for the Council , would also be OOV .
<P> Finally , a common legal OOV OOV to a OOV OOV OOV is in OOV with the Commission ' s policy of OOV the number of small legal OOV and OOV OOV .
I would like to OOV the importance the Commission OOV to this proposal .
The OOV of a common , legal and OOV framework to support our OOV with the OOV countries are clear .
I am OOV that our first report to Parliament on the results of the implementation of this OOV which we present in a OOV of years ' time will OOV that to Parliament ' s OOV .
<P> OOV me OOV to the OOV amendments adopted by Parliament .
I am OOV to say that the Commission can OOV OOV of them .
OOV OOV and Mr OOV , OOV in particular to OOV No OOV . OOV OOV OOV and OOV OOV to the OOV of responsibility between the Community and Member States on market OOV and OOV OOV .
OOV OOV OOV out that the Member States are very OOV to this issue .
OOV these two amendments would result in a OOV OOV OOV from Member States , well OOV what we agreed for the OOV market OOV OOV a few years OOV .
OOV I am not OOV of having OOV OOV with the Council , I would OOV against the OOV of these two amendments .
<P> OOV No OOV of the OOV Committee would be a OOV from the OOV OOV decision and therefore is not OOV OOV .
At any OOV , on that OOV , I do not believe that it is the number of OOV in committee OOV that should really matter to us or to Parliament , it is how many of them are OOV by Community funds .
This is a OOV issue which should find a general OOV OOV of being OOV in every OOV and I hope we can OOV on that basis .
<P> OOV , I would like to thank the rapporteur very OOV for OOV OOV and OOV help in OOV our OOV with some of our OOV OOV OOV the world .
We are , in this particular OOV , OOV an OOV and OOV an important OOV as Mr OOV OOV out a few OOV OOV .
So I thank Parliament for their OOV and I OOV that it will not take too OOV OOV to the fact that there are three of the OOV amendments which I would OOV against .
<SPEAKER OOV NAME=" President " > OOV you very much , Mr OOV .
<P> The debate is OOV .
<P> The vote will take place OOV at OOV OOV
OOV OOV OOV OOV OOV <SPEAKER OOV NAME=" President " > The next OOV is the debate on the report ( OOV ) by Mrs OOV , on behalf of the Committee on OOV , OOV OOV , OOV and OOV on the proposal for a OOV of the European Parliament and of the Council on a Community OOV OOV OOV OOV for OOV and OOV OOV OOV OOV ) OOV - OOV - OOV OOV .
<SPEAKER OOV OOV " > Mr President , this report concerns the OOV OOV by the European Union of the United States ' energy OOV programme as it OOV to OOV and OOV OOV OOV .
This , OOV , is not the OOV OOV on this OOV ' s OOV , OOV , but it is OOV OOV to the future of our OOV and to the OOV of even more OOV OOV OOV , OOV OOV of people and OOV OOV .
<P> OOV OOV and OOV use of energy , with its OOV OOV of OOV and other environmental OOV must OOV .
OOV enough , it is in the United States , where the energy OOV OOV OOV , that we have OOV OOV the OOV OOV of OOV OOV in OOV , OOV because of the OOV increase in the use of OOV and other OOV OOV with the OOV need for OOV within a framework of quite OOV and OOV OOV .
OOV would have been even OOV without the energy OOV programme .
<P> This OOV , which is OOV , was OOV in OOV and is now very OOV .
It has been OOV adopted in OOV and OOV for example .
Members may in fact have OOV the energy OOV OOV on OOV OOV in the EU , although this means OOV yet since the OOV has to be OOV OOV , which is done only in the United States .
<P> This OOV we are OOV the OOV OOV which will OOV the OOV agreement on which we shall vote in the next OOV .
It is a OOV OOV and it is OOV that between now and OOV OOV of OOV OOV OOV and OOV million OOV of OOV OOV will be OOV in the EU through this OOV .
<P> I now OOV the world of OOV OOV and OOV that to be OOV , OOV must go to OOV , but they must OOV up OOV when they are OOV to do so .
OOV they are OOV their OOV OOV is OOV on OOV from OOV OOV to OOV OOV .
OOV the number of OOV in OOV , OOV , OOV , OOV , you can see how the OOV OOV up from the good OOV OOV of those OOV .
OOV now , the European Union has OOV its own energy OOV OOV , often OOV and the European Parliament has taken OOV its responsibility as a OOV to see that such OOV are OOV OOV .
That is why there would be very serious OOV from Parliament about OOV this OOV energy OOV OOV if that were to be our only OOV and especially if there were no OOV in the agreement for OOV OOV of the results , with the OOV , of course , of always being at the OOV OOV of the OOV OOV .
<P> OOV that is not the case however , and the Commission is to be given OOV to OOV OOV in the OOV OOV .
OOV it has been made quite clear to the OOV authorities in a OOV OOV to the agreement that the European Parliament , which would have been a OOV with the Council for OOV measures at European level , will be OOV by the Commission on OOV OOV OOV OOV .
<P> In the amendments to my report , we make it clear that further measures are certainly OOV , including the OOV OOV one of OOV the OOV OOV OOV and OOV particularly OOV OOV from the market , OOV OOV or , if necessary , with legislation .
<P> I am quite OOV that the Council will see the OOV of these amendments and of the OOV and OOV OOV of the energy OOV OOV as one , but only one , OOV of our energy OOV action plan .
We believe the current legal OOV is the OOV one and we OOV the Commission in their OOV .
<P> As rapporteur , I would like to thank the Commission for their cooperation and help and of course thank my OOV , especially Mrs OOV , who OOV a very OOV opinion from the OOV Committee .
We all hope that the energy OOV OOV is a OOV and we look forward to OOV OOV OOV Europe going to OOV at the OOV time .
<SPEAKER OOV LANGUAGE="DE " NAME=" OOV , OOV OOV " > Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , in general , the Commission ' s proposal for a OOV on a OOV OOV programme is to be OOV , and Mrs OOV has OOV an excellent report on it .
OOV OOV is , in my view , an important OOV OOV for OOV the use of OOV OOV .
The OOV OOV should help to OOV energy OOV OOV OOV .
The OOV OOV of this OOV cannot be OOV , and by OOV such a OOV the European Union will be OOV the OOV OOV to OOV people to use energy more OOV .
<P> OOV energy OOV hand in hand with OOV OOV OOV OOV , as agreed under the OOV OOV OOV .
I think it is all the more OOV to OOV if OOV just about OOV to OOV OOV .
This would give us a OOV OOV OOV , not only with the OOV but also , OOV , with OOV and some other countries .
In this way , we would be taking account of the OOV market , which would help OOV OOV to trade .
The OOV of OOV and information OOV would OOV to be particularly important in this respect .
<P> I think it is of the OOV importance for national OOV on energy policy , as well as other OOV parties , to be involved in OOV up the European Union OOV OOV OOV , so that national interests can be OOV OOV .
The OOV OOV OOV will be OOV to OOV up a report on the market OOV of OOV OOV the OOV OOV OOV .
OOV the OOV OOV of OOV development in OOV and OOV OOV , I think OOV OOV would be appropriate .
That is the only way to ensure that the OOV is only used to OOV those OOV which OOV OOV less energy than the OOV for all OOV OOV on the market .
OOV this OOV , I OOV you to support my opinion , which is OOV to this report and which was adopted in the Committee on OOV , OOV OOV , OOV and OOV .
<SPEAKER OOV LANGUAGE="DE " NAME=" OOV " > Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , I would like to OOV the OOV OOV to the rapporteur , Mrs OOV , but also to Mrs OOV OOV , the rapporteur of the Committee on the OOV , OOV OOV and OOV OOV .
OOV energy and OOV OOV OOV such as OOV OOV are important EU OOV .
It is not always possible to achieve these OOV without OOV and without OOV certain OOV , but OOV it is quite a OOV matter .
OOV , all it OOV is to OOV the OOV means , which are already in OOV , yet people do not always have the political will to do this with any OOV .
<P> OOV OOV OOV of OOV OOV in OOV OOV in the country I come from , OOV , is OOV by OOV OOV .
OOV to that the OOV and public OOV and the OOV OOV OOV OOV OOV year , which OOV to the OOV of two OOV OOV OOV that we are OOV OOV for no OOV .
So although no OOV are made on the OOV of the OOV of OOV , it still OOV energy .
OOV of course the OOV OOV to do - as Mrs OOV has already said - would be to OOV the OOV of OOV OOV when it is not in use .
That would be one way of OOV the problem in many OOV , for example , we should OOV do more to OOV the public to get into this OOV with their OOV OOV .
But in quite a few OOV , it is no OOV possible to OOV OOV OOV at all , and it is particularly important for OOV , by their very OOV , to OOV OOV into OOV OOV ' , as Mrs OOV OOV it , and also OOV up ' OOV , because you OOV need to be able to OOV OOV a OOV OOV , and do not want to have to OOV OOV it into life .
<P> There are OOV problems to be OOV with , but they can in fact be OOV by OOV means , without OOV energy .
There are new and OOV OOV OOV to OOV the OOV OOV OOV to OOV ; they just have to be OOV .
OOV of this is OOV from a OOV OOV any OOV .
That is why it is a positive OOV to be OOV the OOV OOV OOV and to OOV OOV that OOV these new OOV OOV and is OOV OOV .
It is the right way to go , which is why the OOV Group OOV the Commission ' s proposal , as well as the report by Mrs OOV .
<P> However , I feel we need to go further still .
OOV I OOV on the responsibility as OOV rapporteur for the OOV Group , I made OOV of OOV in the various organisations , OOV organisations , OOV and in the Commission , but I also OOV people who are OOV with this issue on a OOV basis , for example a OOV OOV who is a OOV of OOV .
I OOV OOV what he OOV of OOV OOV and he OOV that he OOV it was a good OOV .
OOV said there were OOV problems to OOV with , because the OOV OOV into OOV OOV ' OOV , but OOV to OOV up ' again OOV enough .
OOV OOV that although we have now OOV all the OOV problems , no one is OOV in whether or not a OOV has an OOV OOV , and he did not think it was a OOV point .
That is why I think we should consider whether or not we should just OOV the principle we are OOV here , OOV OOV . OOV OOV OOV OOV a positive OOV , or whether we should also OOV to OOV the market of the OOV OOV OOV , which are OOV OOV , and OOV OOV to OOV them OOV to the market after a OOV OOV .
I feel that is something OOV to think about - Mrs OOV ' s report OOV the same point - and then we would have a OOV energy OOV programme in this OOV .
OOV my OOV to you to OOV these amendments .
<SPEAKER OOV NAME=" OOV " > Mr President , I would like to thank Mrs OOV OOV for OOV excellent work , as this issue is a very important one .
We are all agreed on this matter .
The present OOV in OOV of energy OOV is not always the best possible OOV , however .
For example , the OOV for OOV OOV should be that all OOV OOV should be OOV OOV .
But this is not possible in all OOV : OOV OOV often OOV an OOV OOV , as was mentioned here OOV on , making it OOV OOV to OOV it OOV , even if the OOV OOV to .
OOV OOV have a small OOV OOV that OOV OOV to OOV that the OOV is still on and that it is OOV energy to some OOV .
If we OOV the OOV small OOV of one OOV OOV OOV OOV OOV in a OOV this OOV of energy OOV is OOV very OOV .
OOV just a OOV OOV the OOV OOV one OOV OOV OOV , and with a million , one OOV OOV OOV , at which point we are OOV about much OOV OOV of energy OOV .
On the other hand , a OOV current has its positive OOV , when , for example , the OOV in the OOV has to be OOV .
In the OOV regions of the Union , OOV , OOV and OOV are OOV and the OOV OOV from OOV and OOV OOV OOV costs .
But then again , in OOV conditions , especially in the OOV countries of the Union , where OOV must be OOV OOV with OOV , the costs OOV from OOV OOV are OOV .
<P> The general OOV must be to OOV the use of OOV that OOV less energy ; for example , the use of OOV OOV in OOV should always be OOV when they can be OOV with OOV .
OOV , there must be more OOV on OOV information than is the case at present .
It is difficult for the OOV to OOV that OOV that is OOV to OOV but an OOV OOV ' will OOV OOV in the course of time .
OOV OOV OOV must be OOV in such a way that all OOV of any OOV , including OOV and the OOV , OOV how much energy a OOV of OOV OOV .
The information must be OOV OOV to all .
OOV to OOV OOV means OOV to many people .
The OOV of OOV must OOV , for example , in the OOV for use , how to OOV energy OOV the OOV in question .
<SPEAKER OOV LANGUAGE="ES " NAME=" OOV OOV > Mr President , I must first thank Mrs OOV for OOV excellent report .
I would also like to thank Parliament for its OOV support for this proposal .
In the Commission ' s view this proposal will make a OOV contribution to OOV energy OOV and therefore to OOV OOV , which the OOV OOV OOV as OOV to OOV a OOV OOV .
We are also OOV upon to OOV OOV and OOV less , making better use of what we have available .
In OOV , I should like to thank Mrs OOV for OOV opinion on behalf of the Committee on the OOV , OOV OOV and OOV OOV .
<P> A OOV OOV in the OOV of end use of OOV is OOV if we are to OOV the European Union ' s OOV to OOV OOV OOV by the year OOV .
OOV OOV OOV OOV a OOV OOV of energy OOV in the OOV sector and OOV OOV OOV for energy OOV .
The Commission has therefore put forward the OOV OOV OOV as a OOV OOV to OOV the OOV of energy by OOV OOV OOV .
It OOV the measures adopted by other end use OOV such as OOV OOV OOV and OOV .
<P> OOV OOV the Commission has been working on the OOV of this programme with the full support of Community industry and OOV OOV .
The OOV OOV OOV is OOV and OOV use of a OOV OOV : a quality OOV OOV OOV to OOV OOV which OOV energy most OOV .
<P> OOV , OOV to the OOV of the programme the Community will be OOV more than OOV a programme for OOV OOV OOV - which has OOV very OOV where it has been OOV - and OOV in place a OOV OOV to OOV OOV OOV .
We shall be able to OOV the opportunity of OOV a OOV which is in OOV OOV international OOV .
What we are OOV in is important not only for us but because of its OOV in other OOV of the world .
In this OOV , I believe it is OOV for us to become OOV OOV at international level together with the United States .
<P> Mr President , I am aware that Parliament was not very OOV with the OOV OOV in OOV with the OOV and OOV of this agreement .
However , we were OOV by the OOV OOV down in OOV OOV of the Treaty , and I am OOV to OOV that Parliament OOV that the OOV of the agreement OOV such OOV of opinion .
OOV , at Parliament ' s OOV , in a OOV OOV to the agreement , we have OOV the other OOV , OOV the United States .
We shall ensure that Parliament is OOV OOV of the OOV of the OOV OOV , a point OOV by Mrs OOV and with which we OOV agree .
<P> As OOV the amendments , I am in a position to say that we can OOV all the amendments OOV by Parliament , with the OOV of OOV No OOV .
The Commission OOV that the energy OOV of OOV OOV must be OOV , but it does not feel that we should call for a OOV OOV to be set up , as OOV in the OOV OOV , if only because the necessary resources will not be OOV .
I therefore ask you to OOV the matter , ladies and gentlemen .
If this OOV were OOV , I think we could OOV the proposal at first OOV and make OOV progress .
The OOV decision OOV with Parliament of course .
OOV take this into account .
I can OOV you that no further resources will be made available , so in the end it will not OOV any OOV OOV .
<P> On the other hand , we do in principle OOV OOV OOV OOV , OOV , and OOV .
OOV OOV OOV OOV and OOV , we OOV that the Commission should present a report to the Council and to Parliament .
However , the Commission OOV that the best time to do so would be after three years had OOV , as was the case for the first OOV of the OOV OOV OOV <P> That OOV my OOV of our position .
OOV again , I should like to OOV my OOV to the OOV Members who have taken the OOV , and especially to Mrs OOV for OOV OOV work .
I OOV we shall all OOV agreement at the OOV opportunity , if possible at first OOV .
<SPEAKER OOV NAME=" President " > OOV you very much , Commissioner .
<P> The debate is OOV .
<P> The vote will take place OOV at OOV OOV
OOV OOV OOV of OOV OOV <SPEAKER OOV NAME=" President " > The next OOV is the debate on the report ( OOV ) by Mr OOV , on behalf of the OOV OOV to the OOV Committee on the OOV OOV OOV by the OOV Committee for a European Parliament and Council directive OOV OOV OOV and OOV on the general system for the OOV of OOV OOV and OOV OOV OOV , OOV , OOV , OOV , OOV , OOV , OOV , OOV , OOV , OOV , OOV and OOV OOV the OOV of OOV responsible for general OOV , OOV OOV , OOV OOV , OOV , OOV , OOV and OOV OOV - OOV OOV .
<SPEAKER OOV LANGUAGE="DE " NAME=" OOV " > Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , as Mrs OOV said OOV , OOV report was not a particularly OOV matter .
I think reports OOV less OOV the OOV it OOV , but I do not want to OOV Mr OOV , OOV OOV it is next .
<P> This OOV directive OOV and OOV a OOV of OOV OOV , some of which OOV back to OOV .
The President has OOV me some time by already OOV the OOV concerned .
OOV did this report OOV so much OOV , including a time - and OOV OOV OOV , even OOV many may OOV say the OOV Members are OOV as OOV the world is being OOV OOV down , when it is OOV just a matter of OOV ?
OOV did the OOV OOV of us OOV on this OOV OOV ?
There are OOV three OOV .
<P> OOV , OOV from OOV and , in some OOV , OOV OOV , they are all OOV OOV in the OOV OOV .
In OOV life , you can OOV OOV for OOV or OOV OOV , but a human being is not a OOV , a OOV or a OOV that you can take to a OOV or even an OOV OOV to OOV about with .
In such OOV you can make a OOV to make good the OOV .
But when it OOV to health , the OOV cannot OOV be made good .
That is why we have OOV for OOV and OOV .
OOV my own OOV as a OOV , I know of no one who would not OOV have OOV such OOV if the OOV to his health could in that way have been OOV .
<P> If I may OOV OOV , I think the whole OOV is a good example of why the Council OOV in future to OOV in public .
OOV OOV to OOV and from OOV to OOV , our citizens would have been very OOV in much of what was said there and would have OOV , " What are our OOV OOV here ?
We want better OOV OOV "
There is therefore a OOV of interest in these OOV .
<P> OOV , and this OOV me to my second concern , we have the OOV market .
OOV a OOV has been OOV , we want it to be used in the OOV of the OOV OOV of people and services .
OOV course , the Member State on the other OOV and the OOV is OOV first of all in OOV OOV who OOV to OOV his OOV and go to another Member State OOV after his OOV about the OOV he has OOV .
OOV , if OOV OOV to go to another Member State OOV or even OOV years after taking his OOV , the citizens and the OOV Member States want to know what the OOV has been OOV in the last years since his OOV .
OOV he OOV further OOV ?
OOV he OOV OOV OOV of OOV ?
<P> This OOV me to my third reason .
Parliament is OOV that we should OOV OOV OOV .
I have already mentioned that I am a OOV .
OOV I was OOV up on this matter , I have to say it was like going from one OOV to another .
What we OOV here is OOV OOV so far as the OOV public is concerned .
We must OOV OOV OOV more OOV in future .
For these various OOV , Parliament OOV OOV amendments with a OOV OOV , and my only OOV on going to OOV was that I did not ask for that OOV to be OOV , because that would have OOV that well over OOV of us were in favour .
<P> I must therefore also thank Mrs OOV , with OOV I OOV OOV to achieve that OOV OOV , and who had OOV even OOV the OOV OOV had three OOV OOV , that being how things OOV out by the rules of the House .
I will not OOV you with the OOV - OOV for OOV , the matter of OOV OOV in third countries , OOV of the OOV " OOV " by the OOV OOV " and the OOV of OOV OOV OOV .
<P> OOV , three more OOV OOV .
OOV , the Commission has said that it will OOV OOV OOV in future .
I can only OOV all OOV to call for this OOV to be done in their own OOV , too .
OOV , OOV OOV .
We must not just OOV on OOV about it , we must make it a OOV .
I believe we have OOV a good OOV .
For OOV of OOV , we have not OOV any legislation , but we had our way with the OOV .
OOV and OOV , the OOV OOV course for general OOV was OOV to three years .
OOV was OOV to increase it from two and a OOV to three years , OOV we have OOV to Member States OOV and OOV that this OOV OOV can also be OOV with a OOV OOV OOV .
<P> I can therefore say that OOV OOV a good OOV , and I would ask you to vote in favour .
But I should also like to say that we very much OOV that the Commission was OOV not on our OOV from the OOV on the points we were OOV for and on which the Council OOV OOV way .
<SPEAKER OOV LANGUAGE="DE " NAME=" OOV " > Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen of the OOV OOV , OOV who OOV to do good work in OOV must find the OOV and the OOV to OOV .
Mr OOV OOV both OOV in good OOV .
OOV OOV as rapporteur , it was therefore OOV a OOV for OOV and my OOV to work towards the OOV that is now before us .
We can be OOV OOV of that .
We have OOV for the first time to get something that is OOV only OOV about OOV in European law .
I OOV the OOV for OOV OOV .
<P> In the field of OOV , we shall in future not only have rules and OOV for the OOV of OOV , OOV OOV and other OOV of OOV .
We are now OOV for the first time that OOV the OOV OOV OOV is not enough , but that OOV must continue , in the interests of OOV in particular , but also in the interests of OOV and OOV OOV .
<P> OOV the very OOV OOV of OOV and OOV progress in OOV , OOV OOV in one ' s OOV OOV is particularly important .
But we must not be OOV that it now OOV in this OOV directive .
OOV , our legislation should be a contribution to making this OOV OOV and with it OOV OOV into one of the OOV of working life for OOV in Europe .
<P> I should like to OOV another point that has always concerned me in OOV with the OOV of OOV OOV .
I will OOV it up in a question that has still not been OOV by this directive : why are we so OOV to OOV OOV OOV OOV the European Union ?
This question OOV me when I see how OOV are OOV OOV and how OOV we OOV OOV to OOV OOV .
OOV citizens are able to OOV OOV and OOV with them from every OOV of the world , but very OOV OOV in the form of OOV OOV and OOV are not OOV OOV .
There is something OOV there .
We must put it right OOV .
<P> I therefore ask the Commission to OOV two OOV when OOV future OOV OOV .
OOV , that it OOV only a small number of EU citizens .
OOV , that the Treaty OOV only a OOV basis in law .
OOV will go a OOV better then , you will see .
<SPEAKER OOV NAME=" OOV " > Mr President , I would like to OOV with my OOV in OOV the rapporteur for his OOV and OOV work on this issue which may not OOV the OOV , but is of OOV importance to each and every one of the people that we OOV here in this Parliament .
In particular , the areas that we are OOV about in this present OOV of OOV of OOV , are areas where we have OOV OOV OOV within the EU in the recent OOV .
OOV there have been OOV OOV where OOV were put in place and people who OOV to OOV from one Member State to the other could not have the OOV OOV .
<P> OOV of the important issues OOV within the OOV at OOV and also within the report itself is in OOV up some of the OOV used .
In particular there is the question of OOV the OOV " OOV " with the OOV OOV " .
I am OOV OOV with a case in OOV where OOV who has OOV as a OOV in one Member State cannot get their OOV OOV in OOV because of the OOV OOV OOV even OOV in every other country in the European Union work OOV is OOV as the OOV of the OOV OOV .
<P> On OOV of that , there is also a OOV for us to make OOV , once the legislation is OOV at a European level , that the Member States OOV OOV the legislation and open up the OOV that are available .
OOV often we have OOV OOV OOV put in place to OOV people from one OOV or another OOV to a country to OOV .
If we are OOV to OOV about the OOV of the OOV market , and if we are OOV to OOV up to the OOV of the OOV of OOV of OOV , than we must OOV these OOV , which we can see are not so much at a European Union OOV level but are actually at Member State level and indeed in some Member States at the level of certain OOV OOV .
We need OOV OOV of all legislation so any OOV can be OOV with OOV .
<P> I would OOV this report to the House and ask it to support it .
<SPEAKER OOV OOV " NAME=" OOV " > Mr President , on behalf of the Commission , I would like to OOV OOV OOV to the Members of your Parliament who have taken part in the debate , for all the OOV work they have done .
In particular , I would like to OOV out Mr OOV as the OOV who OOV the report and who has OOV to OOV the OOV process to a OOV end .
The Commission is OOV that the Council and the European Parliament have OOV agreement .
<P> The Commission can OOV with the result which , after all , OOV to OOV the OOV of OOV and to improve legal OOV .
OOV this , Parliament has OOV a result with the Council which is in the interest of all those OOV OOV and OOV for OOV OOV in Europe .
It will be of great OOV to the OOV of OOV , and that is important .
<P> As I already OOV , I would particularly like to thank Mr OOV , but also other Members who have OOV with OOV , for all the OOV work they have done in order to OOV this agreement .
Mr President , I would like to OOV general OOV to your Parliament for the OOV cooperation with both the Council and the Commission .
<SPEAKER OOV NAME=" President " > OOV you for your OOV words , Mr OOV .
<P> The debate is OOV .
<P> The vote will take place OOV at OOV OOV
OOV OOV OOV Group on OOV OOV <SPEAKER OOV NAME=" President " > The next OOV is the report ( OOV ) by Mr OOV , on behalf of the Committee on OOV ' OOV and Rights , OOV and OOV OOV on the report of the OOV Group on OOV OOV - OOV OOV on OOV OOV OOV - OOV - OOV OOV <SPEAKER OOV OOV " NAME=" OOV > Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , Mr OOV , this resolution of OOV may not be as OOV as it could be , for OOV is OOV OOV , or at least , OOV are made to OOV it of its OOV .
In OOV , I see this OOV for a resolution as being quite an OOV , OOV OOV OOV in that it is OOV .
In any case , I would like to start by making the point that the Member States , often out of a OOV OOV of OOV , OOV to OOV what can OOV to be a OOV of OOV , particularly in the field of OOV OOV .
OOV , OOV Community OOV and the OOV of the Member States in this area is not OOV .
<P> The OOV for OOV OOV by the Member States set OOV in the OOV OOV OOV OOV OOV , which - OOV OOV OOV OOV - has become OOV , OOV us to OOV out the first OOV .
The first OOV countries have been OOV : OOV , OOV , OOV , OOV and the OOV , and a Committee of three OOV has been set up .
The group OOV a country may not OOV OOV who are OOV of that country and so the action is , so to OOV , quite OOV .
<P> These OOV OOV have OOV , first and OOV , that there is often a OOV of political OOV in legal OOV , particularly as OOV OOV for OOV cooperation on OOV measures , OOV of OOV and OOV , and this OOV different OOV , OOV OOV the OOV of OOV or different OOV authorities from that OOV OOV , OOV . <P> OOV course , certain positive OOV have also been OOV , such as a OOV system from the OOV OOV as OOV , which has been used as a OOV .
We are , of course , OOV extremely OOV OOV OOV OOV which use OOV OOV .
OOV change and so we also have to OOV to deal with OOV in different OOV .
<P> The reports from OOV , OOV , OOV and OOV are also OOV , but as yet OOV .
However , we hope that there will be a OOV system for the OOV OOV , to be the responsibility , in the long OOV , of the Court of OOV .
Parliament has OOV this on OOV OOV too .
<P> In OOV fact , in this regard , it is most important to OOV that a number of OOV rules need to be OOV .
I OOV , for example , to OOV OOV , which often OOV up the OOV , OOV OOV of OOV ; I OOV to the situation where a OOV has been OOV which is not a OOV in the other Member States .
For example , OOV once OOV to OOV with the OOV made by the OOV OOV of another country because the OOV was not a OOV under OOV law .
There are therefore various OOV , and if we do not OOV in OOV them , OOV cooperation will , in OOV , be OOV but a OOV .
<P> OOV , in order to make it OOV , another resolution has already been OOV on the OOV OOV of OOV decisions .
I have OOV to it in this OOV for a resolution as well in order to provide a OOV , a OOV OOV of OOV OOV OOV to make this OOV cooperation more OOV .
We all OOV the OOV need for an OOV OOV , a OOV OOV OOV OOV at least the OOV decisions , at least within the Community framework .
OOV , it would be extremely OOV to be able to OOV have the OOV of OOV OOV against OOV or OOV who have already been OOV , at a OOV level within Europe , but OOV would already be a good basis - not OOV on a OOV OOV - since information OOV should now make it possible for us to achieve OOV results OOV .
<P> The OOV for a resolution OOV for OOV OOV OOV by OOV - we have OOV it on OOV OOV - and particularly by the OOV European OOV OOV who , at least on OOV of serious OOV - OOV OOV , OOV OOV , OOV OOV OOV , OOV OOV , OOV . can OOV take the OOV .
We therefore call for cooperation from the OOV authorities , public OOV and OOV of the different Member States as well , which will then become part of the European OOV OOV as support at the level of the different States .
<P> In OOV , it is a proposal OOV the European OOV OOV and what is OOV as OOV OOV ' .
I would OOV this because , when all is said and done , common OOV and good OOV in OOV the various OOV OOV , first and OOV , for the OOV OOV of OOV between OOV authorities .
<SPEAKER OOV OOV " NAME=" OOV > Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , our OOV OOV is the OOV of a great European area of OOV , security and OOV , in which it is OOV that we OOV the security of European citizens and the OOV against OOV OOV .
OOV what was agreed in OOV , it is OOV that we OOV national legislation on OOV OOV and the OOV OOV in the field of OOV OOV .
In other words , it is OOV that we OOV our efforts on OOV common OOV , OOV and OOV with regard to the OOV of legislation in OOV OOV .
<P> This OOV OOV , which Mr OOV has just mentioned and which OOV the basis of the excellent report that he OOV to the Committee on OOV ' OOV and Rights , OOV and OOV OOV , was OOV on the basis of the action plan against OOV OOV OOV in OOV in OOV OOV .
This can already be OOV , OOV OOV , as a OOV OOV forward , OOV by the OOV of the European OOV OOV and other OOV to OOV and increase the OOV of systems to OOV and OOV OOV .
<P> OOV this OOV system , although it is OOV that the Council will OOV the necessary measures after one OOV OOV of OOV - in other words , three years , with OOV countries being OOV OOV year - we should welcome the decisions taken by some Member States to OOV in OOV the OOV and OOV OOV to be most OOV within their own legal systems , OOV in OOV the results of these OOV .
We are all OOV to have the results of the OOV of the OOV countries , one of which is my own country , OOV , OOV to us OOV .
<P> I welcome the fact that the matter that has been OOV for the first OOV of OOV is that of OOV in the OOV of the system for OOV legal OOV and in the OOV of OOV OOV for the OOV of OOV , with particular regard to OOV used in OOV of OOV OOV .
The OOV on the problem of OOV is particularly positive .
OOV , we are concerned to see an increase in OOV OOV in OOV and we are fully aware of how OOV this is .
OOV which is OOV or which OOV too OOV is , OOV , always a OOV of OOV itself .
<SPEAKER OOV LANGUAGE="DE " NAME=" OOV " > Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , Commissioner , on behalf of my group , I support the OOV , OOV and OOV OOV by the rapporteur , and I also OOV his concern about the problems OOV by the OOV Group .
I thank Mr OOV for his work .
In the EU there are OOV different OOV OOV , a OOV number of OOV OOV , some of them OOV with each other , and OOV legal systems , all OOV OOV by their own OOV , OOV and OOV .
OOV the OOV s OOV law systems are OOV - something which is to be OOV - OOV cooperation will continue to OOV through a OOV and OOV system of OOV for legal OOV , an OOV OOV for OOV all public OOV and OOV .
<P> But European cooperation is more OOV than OOV .
For example , OOV % of all OOV of OOV OOV in OOV in OOV had an international OOV .
There is a great need for the Council to OOV .
In OOV , for example , the OOV of OOV must give his OOV OOV OOV the OOV sector is involved .
The OOV use their own OOV of OOV OOV of OOV the OOV of the OOV State .
The OOV countries have OOV OOV and OOV OOV and financial resources for OOV with OOV for legal OOV .
On the positive OOV , we can OOV the OOV ' OOV programme , the OOV system and OOV ' s OOV with the OOV countries .
OOV OOV points OOV within the OOV OOV , there is good OOV and results , but the OOV has no OOV over OOV OOV for legal OOV .
The OOV of OOV points OOV is still no OOV of the OOV OOV OOV in European cooperation .
At some OOV points , the OOV to make OOV OOV also OOV much to be OOV .
<P> If the Council is serious about OOV OOV OOV OOV , which OOV OOV democracy and the rules of the legal OOV , the OOV of the rapporteur and the committee must be OOV into action .
I do not want to go over the OOV of what Mr OOV has already said , but it does OOV that the OOV countries need to be fully involved in the OOV for OOV OOV OOV at an OOV OOV .
The OOV OOV must be further OOV , for example with OOV OOV about the various legal systems , with OOV OOV and , OOV , OOV should become a OOV OOV to OOV and OOV .
<SPEAKER OOV NAME=" OOV " > Mr President , I would like to thank the rapporteur for the work that he has done on a very difficult and OOV issue .
OOV has OOV some OOV and OOV to it but OOV OOV OOV , I have some OOV and some points that I cannot agree with .
On any of these issues we must be very OOV that we do not come out in a OOV of OOV OOV , OOV that we are going to OOV all of the problems of all of the OOV in the European Union OOV by OOV up another OOV or another OOV with more OOV , and OOV and OOV more OOV into a OOV OOV .
<P> There are already OOV of where cooperation and OOV work .
We have OOV , and other OOV like this , where different OOV in different Member States working together can achieve results .
We also have the opportunity to OOV other Member States and take the best OOV from them and use those as a common OOV OOV for all Member States .
However , we still have OOV of law within the Member States .
We still have different legal systems , for OOV .
In OOV and OOV we still work under the OOV common law system OOV on the OOV of Europe you have the civil law system .
It is very difficult , OOV OOV , to OOV these two together , so we must always work on the basis of three OOV of how things should OOV .
<P> OOV one : OOV , number two : OOV , and number three : OOV ; and we must not OOV the OOV OOV ' .
OOV should have the right to OOV themselves when they are OOV or OOV made against them .
OOV it is only a problem of OOV , but some of the OOV for the OOV approach OOV to be OOV we have to OOV through some of the present legal OOV for OOV with regard to the right of OOV .
<P> I am particularly OOV that OOV OOV OOV OOV because of the OOV OOV OOV .
I would OOV each and every Member of this House and every Member State to look at how the OOV OOV OOV OOV in OOV and how OOV it has been since its OOV .
<P> OOV proposal which I OOV - and we have OOV for a OOV vote - is on the question of a European OOV OOV ' s OOV .
I am OOV OOV to a European OOV OOV ' s OOV with its OOV OOV over the OOV of all the Member States .
<P> Finally , OOV Member States is a very OOV area .
We already have OOV of how it can go OOV and how difficult it is to OOV .
It is better to OOV on cooperation ; the OOV OOV a OOV better than the OOV .
<SPEAKER OOV OOV " NAME=" OOV > Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , the Commission would like to OOV Mr OOV on the excellent report he has OOV , which OOV a very OOV and OOV OOV of the problems we OOV in the field of OOV cooperation and OOV an OOV and OOV OOV of the efforts OOV to OOV these problems .
The Commission OOV OOV the OOV and the OOV OOV out by the rapporteur .
We agree , in particular , with the approach that OOV of OOV that OOV OOV cooperation - or even , to use Mr OOV s words , " a OOV new OOV OOV " - must OOV be OOV as a OOV of the OOV of the Member States .
OOV , this should be OOV as a OOV , and OOV the most important OOV , for making this OOV OOV in the OOV of the OOV and OOV of OOV OOV , which today OOV an extremely serious OOV to the OOV of OOV government , to the very OOV of the rules of the OOV OOV and to respect for citizens ' rights .
<P> We are clearly on the way to OOV this , but it must be OOV that this progress has been made not as a result of OOV OOV - because many of these OOV are no OOV in OOV : for example , the OOV have not been OOV OOV by the Member States - but OOV because , in the OOV , OOV OOV have been OOV , such as , for example , the OOV for OOV OOV .
This has given OOV OOV of the need to find a new OOV and , in certain OOV , has already OOV to Member States OOV the necessary amendments to their own legislation .
<P> This process of OOV in the field OOV information , whether it is OOV out in the framework of OOV OOV , in OOV within the OOV OOV or , quite OOV , I hope , in the framework of cooperation within OOV , is OOV and must be OOV .
Parliament is now being OOV on the OOV of the OOV programme , which is an important OOV for OOV cooperation between legal OOV and OOV , on the OOV of OOV a European OOV for OOV OOV , which will OOV the development of OOV cooperation OOV between OOV ' OOV in the various Member States .
<P> OOV the OOV and OOV made by the rapporteur , I wish to OOV just three OOV : OOV , Mr OOV OOV to the need to OOV OOV OOV of the Treaty on European Union so that the Court of OOV of the European OOV is given the OOV to OOV whether the Member States OOV with their OOV .
This OOV in OOV OOV is , in my opinion , OOV to the OOV of OOV OOV of the Treaty on European Union itself , which OOV OOV OOV with an OOV OOV .
I wish to OOV that it would OOV be more OOV , at the appropriate time , to call for a more OOV and OOV OOV , OOV OOV the working OOV or the OOV framework OOV of the OOV OOV ' , OOV to the Community OOV , which would OOV ensure greater OOV by the Court of OOV , as well as OOV OOV that OOV greater OOV by the European Parliament itself .
I do , OOV , OOV some OOV as to the OOV of being able to OOV measures for OOV Member States that do not OOV with their OOV .
<P> OOV of the measures OOV by the OOV resolution is the OOV of a European OOV OOV 's OOV , with OOV over the whole Union .
As Parliament OOV , at the last OOV OOV , the Commission OOV that the Treaty should provide for an OOV European OOV OOV , but with the specific and OOV OOV of OOV the Community ' s financial interests .
This proposal was not OOV in OOV and the Commission will certainly take this decision by the Council into account , having already OOV OOV with OOV the OOV and means necessary for OOV to be able to OOV its OOV .
OOV the same OOV , we hope that the OOV of the OOV OOV will also be something that OOV to this OOV , which was not OOV in OOV .
<P> As to the issue of OOV , I wish to OOV Mr OOV that I OOV the concerns OOV in his report with regard to the OOV and OOV of OOV OOV , which are , in fact , the OOV of the third OOV of OOV OOV .
This is why the Commission has OOV a specific initiative on the OOV of OOV OOV for OOV in its programme for OOV .
<P> I wish to OOV , Mr President , by OOV that I OOV the concern OOV by the rapporteur that , in this field , all OOV OOV must be OOV with respect for OOV rights and OOV OOV and that this respect for citizens ' rights and OOV is OOV OOV to the OOV against OOV OOV .
At a time when the Union has OOV the OOV of OOV Rights , it is our OOV to OOV to OOV in such a way that the progress made in the field of OOV cooperation , the OOV OOV of OOV , the OOV of OOV OOV by the OOV and the OOV and the OOV of OOV OOV OOV with the OOV that we OOV and that they are not OOV at the OOV of the rights of OOV .
The OOV of an area of OOV , security and OOV cannot by OOV by OOV the OOV common OOV where respect for citizens ' rights and OOV is concerned .
<SPEAKER OOV NAME=" President " > OOV you , Commissioner .
<P> The debate is OOV .
<P> The vote will take place OOV at OOV OOV
<P> ( The OOV was OOV at OOV OOV )
